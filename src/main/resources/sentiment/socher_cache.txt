This isn't among my favorite Hitchcock films, though I must admit it's still pretty good. Among the things I really liked were the presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary looking assassin (who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him). Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I didn't particularly care for Doris Day in the film--she seemed to weep a lot and belts out "Que Sera" like a fullback. Yes, I know that she was supposed to sing in that manner, but this forever made me hate this song. Sorry.<br /><br />The other complaint, though minor, I had about the movie was that it was a little "too polished" and "Hollywood-esque". The original version (also done by Hitchcock) just seemed a lot grittier and seedier--and this added to the scary ambiance.	-3.7357527535967536	-1.9544664398725626	-1.9451222183058925	-1.926564388464576	-1.8256420067873826	-0.7188841859545385	-0.5584126540530793	-0.5102873275656353	-0.40507180186338915	-0.3425346348438795	-0.31448741976522593	-0.2621523925614961	-0.04424539998371749	0.015147303848900617	0.03488212237640206	0.09434709390252843	0.15385240499907657	0.1877142583533919	0.6424214702943695	0.6491146723062795	0.6830997526431835	0.819802579504122	0.9166473983519318	2.2701971657585163	3.88015152950342	
This isn't exactly a great film, but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different. The film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS, though instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion. Plus, an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film (like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY).<br /><br />The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou. This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE, though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role. The pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all. The only reason I didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots.	-1.7000505571318496	-1.6442928082627075	-1.4485117226552928	-1.0538333777712112	-0.8309903084858152	-0.8270641919034634	-0.4554328353341569	-0.3517360339263767	-0.32446783701639825	-0.2528228684024848	-0.224234607112594	-0.12308695351292352	-0.11230734390347029	-0.09924866884713826	3.7998905897232427E-4	0.04829667997539201	0.12235039296803786	0.13300487298792438	0.5234945701790443	0.791685576107596	1.0115184618555837	1.3574788327243912	1.3970959093593938	1.899021800384474	2.7621910288897684	
In the rapid economic development of 1990's in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />However, the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, was not without disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />Moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction.<br /><br />The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.	-1.9514877304943303	-1.1899427292252687	-1.0127007231522045	-0.9851664713917396	-0.9585904266063212	-0.552858244110429	-0.5169690496418173	-0.4431443564857647	-0.39997020890268853	-0.2902783449499313	-0.23751533633377991	-0.21777851317192562	-0.08988429659193854	-0.07163875499472697	0.0768060959015815	0.1059643307112508	0.20601204513999183	0.22359368101833985	0.4230331993659832	0.5119580690134999	0.5174948828233017	0.782029305491136	0.8359341375691702	1.4248603155687234	2.3350236428245816	
***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements. First off a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the puppets turn good in this sequel. Finally, It introduces some scifi/fantasy elements as well.<br /><br />A new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay, his girlfriend, her psychic friend, and that psychics boyfriend, stumble upon Andre Toulon's puppet trunk. They also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds Toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving. So Sutekh (the demon) sends the totems, a bunch of craven little creatures that look like ear-less gremlins. Then it's up to the puppet troupe to take care of the inter-dimensional threat that's trying to kill there new friends.<br /><br />Like most low budget movies this film is rife with continuity problems. How did the puppets get put back in the trunk? How come nobody remembers the last rasche of killngs in the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why would a contractor by a building with a history of mass murders? All this and many more questions, will not be answered...ever.<br /><br />The real suprise of this movie is the acting. It's actually pretty good. The actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of Full Moon nonames. Teresa Hill was especially impressive as the shy, nervous, psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant suprise also. Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist. But Cameron was far too annoying to stomach. Thank the norse god he dies before halfway through.<br /><br />The puppets are there usual animated selves. With some improvements as well. There emotions (especially Jester's) are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them. Blade's hisses, Pinhead's grunts, and Six-Shooter's snicker have all been improved and sound much better. The stop-motion animation is only average at best, especially the totems. They just don't seem to move as fluidly as the previous installment in the series. Also the Sutekh costume is absolutely awefull. How are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking.<br /><br />The story seems a bit juvinile for the series. I think Charlie Band was looking to focus in on a younger demographic. The violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same. Gore fans will be disappointed.<br /><br />I think the above is the main problem this movie can't really stick with many people. It doesn't have the violence for gorewhores. The language is a little cleaner. Yet it's too violent and harsh for the wee ones. Which is why the movie gets low ratings. I have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair.	-10.812605622638957	-6.141660712017689	-4.720644574269326	-4.526986059532028	-3.1325915973716776	-2.7618532247475374	-2.7257340213983183	-2.5215250419136326	-1.0857014071809497	-0.4375352428219401	-0.21398670682660814	0.16111446008625666	0.33860654828008496	0.5551340413675315	0.7287018767036145	0.7731898993985408	1.2299869891306008	1.9713118055246805	2.028927890693066	2.1483446100782944	2.334983576466595	3.0417715057491175	4.2371305539896085	5.783994800220662	13.467992375756763	
This is a great example of very none Hollywood film making which is very thought provoking, moving and not without a sense of humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are superb. <br /><br />I actually watched it on late night TV and I can see why I missed it in the cinema, its not the sort of film that the multi-screen "mega" cinemas show nowadays, mores the pity. <br /><br />I am going to look for the DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend towards special effects and no story. If you liked the best selling book "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time", you'll enjoy this film. <br /><br />This film ranks beside the best of Scottish films, such as "Small Faces" and "trainspotting". All films which Kevin McKidd also star in. <br /><br />Highly Recommended.	-1.5289890907463348	-1.2411958423792542	-1.1321320076320294	-0.6747578350541819	-0.6724230608233527	-0.6594299111059122	-0.656407423667428	-0.3912223687539358	-0.29360046435648596	-0.2833321696457442	-0.1507914813129105	-0.01344956517488586	0.077328940990672	0.24655839466828888	0.2527326623711326	0.26180199665598186	0.2970409505724091	0.32638128018826307	0.7372196652243653	0.7446721049997996	0.7912035273970706	0.8141648877355503	1.3063067201264045	1.628162969482682	2.589837789686409	
This is the biggest Flop of 2008. I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish... Akki is also done a good job.... But the movieee just forget it.	-1.0878665127824065	-0.981119794179629	-0.8931749061153962	-0.7092291765100887	-0.6703906536514075	-0.3494485900800498	-0.27374768171474917	-0.237918023078626	-0.1778738348467027	-0.12870879445756192	-0.04576933033866548	-0.026231283371649206	-0.0064332084412295765	-0.004041396350242192	0.0229927518981249	0.12157051567547308	0.1280337957919338	0.12979113798126976	0.25496955549539657	0.3727543093657947	0.37643726381635545	0.6846297459787692	0.7742310343062919	1.1688089764944207	2.0257994299607636	
If you're looking for an original horror flick, this might be the one for you. It's strange and at times lingers on stupidity, but it's just such a good looking, nice sounding and original movie, it never fails, except maybe during the over long climax. "Nightbreed" is a must see for horror fans, or for fans of monster movie make-up.<br /><br />Boone (Craig Sheffer) has been having dreams of a town called Midian full of mutant creatures. In therapy, his psychiatrist Dr. Decker (horror director David Cronenberg) has come to the conclusion that Boone is a murderer, and gives him hallucinogenic pills, and tells him to turn himself in. After almost getting killed, Boone ends up at the hospital, where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about Midian, and tells Boone where to go. Midian, located in a graveyard, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let Boone in. After escaping with only a nasty bite, Boone is shot dead by the police, who were lead to his location by Dr. Decker. But Boone isn't dead. The bite causes him to live, and he goes off to Midian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend Lori (Anne Bobby) tries to find Boone and get to the bottom of this. When Dr. Decker also finds out about this place, chaos ensues.<br /><br />The plot seems long and complicated, but it really isn't hard to understand. The plot, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. The make-up effects are astounding. The creatures look unique and amazing, and make this a very appealing film. To add to more senses appeal, we have a musical score by Danny Elfman, that is both lush and bouncy, and fits the film like a glove. The shots in the movie are also set up beautifully. The cinematography is lovely, and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken. Even the acting is good, with the biggest surprise being director David Cronenberg giving a great, menacing performance as the man, who for one reason or another, wants to see Boone dead. It's odd for a horror film to be this well done.<br /><br />The problems with the movie...well there are a few, but the positives outweigh the negatives. The script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor, but almost every one falls flat. The mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted, but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera. The worst part of the film would have to be the climax. It takes so long, and is just constant chaos. It's the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots, to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don't know or care about.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is amazing to look at. It's a well done horror film, but even with that said, it has the occasional failure in character's lines, and a messy climax. Nonetheless, this is one to check out.<br /><br />My rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. R for strong violence and language.	-6.78517244221396	-6.6324474963318645	-5.853691105800173	-4.852617203846175	-4.017466546588072	-3.6637723172775165	-3.371912367226402	-2.041746614560785	-1.1129078856125876	-1.0772656485803656	-0.9288467544723547	-0.440859986073383	-0.16719665259180022	0.6524219059571444	0.9461206547155844	1.0367416025523617	1.2196534471721168	1.6827086585797177	2.5231233861430615	3.025047705343341	3.354360060648642	4.0821068354603005	5.523169215993112	8.674695767587906	13.496786173374913	
Ok, so it's not a masterpiece like the Godfather, but it doesn't have to be. The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times. If it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times, it has accomplished its purpose. I laughed out loud and left with a smile. I feel like I got my money's worth.	-1.8636832109308692	-1.362025025160608	-0.9531762068798049	-0.7645770348929233	-0.686152020856482	-0.3584926489597607	-0.24052210698487503	-0.04090920607424283	0.007777817941382326	0.020336250511873585	0.10480060491199797	0.1299930547539619	0.17098391451107342	0.272979381767243	0.2951869497458477	0.30349049241067677	0.39642208428095105	0.43561355920615497	0.4480777341549302	0.6328187682175668	0.6685898664191372	0.6895813239170501	1.4857694749128532	1.5669207100016616	1.7508280283010356	
I was around 7 when I saw this movie first.

To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.	-3.292112879830177	-2.268000610287232	-2.023989502840207	-1.9322313601443803	-1.3237023716314447	-1.2030052147611632	-0.9255868056662271	-0.5823678016268615	-0.06937058229681961	-0.04543493999929887	0.047563272309287113	0.21752902110941086	0.21906679517324174	0.23054956617412842	0.39654667966496804	0.40334280044407267	0.41237027152900846	0.5464621767815515	0.6797943547158416	0.7197988279721046	0.7844189635305603	0.9266768606536692	2.2125503325418663	3.070863038175507	5.8905236341635545	
I don't think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you were ever scared. This doesn't really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn't tack on one of those happy endings. Story is about an American couple who travel to Kyoto, Japan so that Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and he brings along his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works at the American Consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted. About 140 years earlier in the same house a Samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide. Their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the Fletcher's arrive it doesn't take long before strange things start happening.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />At times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletcher's and they start to act like the Japanese people that they were before and Laura starts to flirt with Alex which leads to an affair. Meanwhile, Ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of Amy he goes to ask a Monk for help. Unfortunately the ghosts get Ted, Laura, and Alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier.<br /><br />This film was directed by Kevin Connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with McClure on some of them. While this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that I liked. First, it doesn't have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts. Secondly, it has Susan George in the cast! I've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch. Also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn't have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it's one of the reasons why she was so popular. But after appearing in silly films such as this I think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically. This isn't a bad film but it's never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the Monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two. The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope George decides to resume her career.	-6.160207792629368	-3.5912746968340863	-2.8090062221116017	-2.7244095606628203	-2.3316104252268017	-1.3599488549848209	-1.1259429461721195	-0.845640875933684	-0.7639076668467336	-0.7203901144236514	-0.5080795513478166	-0.29015509205968076	-0.01695668501191703	-0.0013277621571004703	0.07550260945722799	0.5084854658724439	0.7349435131296999	1.0010443460101477	1.007934662407245	1.0669647352343996	1.3924767372175368	1.7323338406129047	2.0067123998414784	3.664491839915162	7.554299574115449	
This is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see.<br /><br />It really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and (like an H.G. Welles Story I can't quite recall) may live to want back.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring =bang= it's over. And, believe me, the 'punch line' is one you will remember.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase - or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy - of that I am sure.	-1.6223270175994713	-1.5937040897174513	-1.405398330329753	-1.1683390694000622	-1.1283310290050796	-0.6729675900192591	-0.6395285519945808	-0.272471394707295	-0.20406815893384223	-0.1674052301172173	-0.10519436648299545	-0.023124766905375148	0.01694501920511776	0.1273588065764042	0.16108702430752309	0.17856893962831216	0.24783921546347298	0.36340977901038235	0.5054659006862791	0.5334037714347775	0.8412552538066546	1.026646655451159	1.2134441681378634	1.8607514319071732	2.7491877475445374	
This is how movies are supposed to be made: a fascinating setting; characters about whom you come to care deeply; writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense. This is a wonderful film -- deeply moving without being sentimental. Highly recommended.	-1.5231641179737558	-1.031959848938749	-0.6418985634908999	-0.465289977732953	-0.3889680883807082	-0.33081181162160833	-0.07616985935079597	-0.0639462733284496	-0.06259634941088953	0.1223699423424679	0.27227972671459916	0.2977569178950691	0.3274217721444273	0.3384452195401827	0.3956018667673238	0.4814127785173121	0.5266393091432796	0.5483868945197408	0.6362771443526324	0.6966386601332103	0.6976384760472797	0.9023828815105428	1.0700309030947208	1.1221587789298157	1.5526438509211982	
The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a "walker" is or will really care. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70's. The subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in DC. I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. Most didn't stay for the Q&A either.<br /><br />I don't think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. I really didn't get Woody's (Carter) private life or boyfriend either. What were all the "artistic" male bondage and torture pictures (from Iraq prisons) about? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for Woody's character (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even seem to make sense really.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. You really did get a great sense of what a "walker" may have been like (say twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it. <br /><br />As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin... Boring.<br /><br />Don't see it! It is painful! Unless you are a true Harrelson fan.	-11.013934096334	-4.944219782078345	-4.08688774503004	-4.0386985154621575	-3.9960479984875747	-2.7849205398687946	-2.755627332074485	-1.3307452060586458	-0.547601921916995	-0.2317791235194755	-0.16153450046141524	-0.10549105158955338	-0.05620534995224049	0.8391739029561667	0.8604177549233529	0.9930309479304588	1.0254121137726888	1.3037630129363817	1.4166352049211715	1.4289956385179141	1.8893165468684365	2.440372813578624	5.15677524462882	5.349151746719996	12.550840371535372	
Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.<br /><br />The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in "Even Stevens" this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.	-4.596733594185334	-2.977959618039236	-1.4585648089154675	-1.3314873836506695	-0.7912918100670406	-0.5484230263060157	-0.42235126554444036	-0.1522999670757954	0.2191509729184239	0.32148871818964364	0.3361382587538303	0.6399855604008414	0.6958301687168993	0.7105147561582991	1.2169731169290738	1.2834827661939292	1.4124213161747932	1.457634802249323	1.4591938900043717	1.475091323635202	1.4950107572337508	1.91554689874674	2.4124240930369676	3.4452569857098334	4.430609612104616	
When one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, "They Died With Their Boots On" (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. It is the sweeping saga of General Custer (Flynn) - told from the time he enters West Point military academy and falls for the luscious Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), through his tenure during the American Civil War, and finally with his death at Little Big Horn. Director, Raoul Walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. Hence, the battle against Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land Custer gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the Nation's first peoples. <br /><br />Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer as though he is one part Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts Albert Schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner stock players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.<br /><br />Overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, "They Died With Their Boots On" is ample film fodder for a Saturday matinée or Sunday night cooing with one's sweetheart. Warner's DVD is pretty nice looking. Although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. Some fading is obvious during scene transitions. The audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level.	-2.770662499021374	-1.8927623929508344	-1.857709410365398	-1.5370185386192614	-1.2971946480673338	-0.7930591569668899	-0.40983541800015794	-0.39648334589611756	-0.22123889412896544	-0.16004493106037662	-0.1350279075088175	0.16548634396441164	0.1840851444564634	0.2047192870945544	0.42338926490831214	0.4496321803845409	0.5784846701037147	0.5903625380359165	0.737431136437113	0.8263044648464367	0.866298588367851	1.4140729288028855	2.5829349672990034	2.910171476907097	4.155056201113681	
This is one of those films that I could only sit through once. Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie just clumped along with no cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. What a pity! It's such a great book. I would recommend Disney's 1951 version.	-2.950295150763564	-2.0258203258203005	-1.8678666252630522	-1.4713284271376141	-1.011807804075335	-0.9625081805369129	-0.7430343475507555	-0.21038162983513625	-0.16502785272543444	-0.04524715809729579	-0.022789970261086912	0.02624353407634597	0.05832306826575606	0.10843608388594375	0.12421928441109406	0.22093495784994002	0.3709106705279913	0.38066987886125264	0.4096013340798887	0.634143424582252	0.8065637600580546	1.0652165009658188	1.3018709762276033	2.3249695302961593	4.317523172061169	
Look it's Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend. It's Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives and the guy who wore "sex Panther cologne" in Anchorman. If you are expecting a Golden Globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies. However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place. The characters are all funny. They work together very well. The real match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He's as funny as he was on Friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.	-2.8151710995757284	-2.3278024473773407	-1.3103294485050303	-0.8792678926930837	-0.7270958172784839	-0.28497368457054295	-0.026804728604969276	-0.0057667917313922665	0.13329946194603545	0.1776064304806266	0.2378908301474645	0.4035401680999666	0.40797107877648675	0.5550693572383474	0.5811623466649328	0.6782729793162485	0.6969850598275437	0.7724479749500244	0.9227567115442425	0.9347619391604531	0.9602930232849471	1.0096391291610158	1.8366265054509268	1.914743985537045	3.0465481679569884	
The Great Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I dare to say that he performs some songs better than Caruso (check A'Vuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini). The MGM art and music departments also did a good job. This movie could be perfect, were it not for the awkward presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she is trying her best, dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better leading lady, and Blyth should stick to less demanding productions. Also notice that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano.	-2.160951460789866	-1.1679301615252804	-0.8918951587088433	-0.8498603905256819	-0.7983085222516101	-0.31632907747043	-0.1933618371150052	0.020602527026905917	0.09209583632017351	0.1322649532398573	0.29083345267327865	0.3177538987710693	0.357111274494089	0.3934578585935947	0.48115225237226067	0.4862485077802205	0.5636614362936767	0.7101962555120088	0.809564034176705	0.8494710206912532	0.9262250782646864	1.1124670252135445	1.3923617317196142	1.6340138726983107	2.3164076822553454	
You know how Star Trek fans flocked to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones? Why? To see their heroes in action one more time. That's the way I feel about Doc Savage. I am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. Then they decided to crib elements from a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. There's a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the "camp" elements, etc.) But the spirit of Doc is there, and that's what those of us familiar with Doc and his crew respond to. So, in my long-winded way, what I'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.	-3.80895537381907	-2.387883474087528	-1.970327442966914	-1.6212556904089543	-1.5696347176734786	-1.215248968331773	-0.9640577395197869	-0.40527112474378324	-0.2542125068865236	-0.05015268799766358	0.03000920300732538	0.036337731881113555	0.05046655996747047	0.19036357908254262	0.2793441232130049	0.2920698915919142	0.29247765157240396	0.3176660160812324	0.5184361009612638	0.5528853045642462	0.6715794094778298	0.8289836494531367	1.4648888394420383	2.3928111871159627	4.471691240996063	
This is a cut above other movies of the genre: genuinely suspenseful, intelligent, brilliantly acted and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing - but that's partly what makes it pack such a punch. Watch it twice if you can. You'll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the fact that this film comes from Korea, a country not too familiar to most Western audiences. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All of these are handled superbly by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the lead character. Also worthy of particular mention is Yum Jung-ah, who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother. <br /><br />While it has its scary moments, this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it. It's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery. It grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end - and possibly beyond!	-2.2254888017875567	-2.069339773606927	-1.8547162637548396	-1.3444967026331727	-0.9805866608217473	-0.5390409698729683	-0.5372259521892977	-0.21301002074468783	-0.08992069872104691	-0.02534991876670628	-0.011349291264602046	0.11004497300304131	0.1439147104629598	0.31020370954327753	0.4756917325552199	0.4970829408950623	0.6220299440792181	0.7669685751533136	0.8073153685426488	0.90301350211649	1.3166694413040474	1.736743971778026	2.4642266936512778	2.601713627950635	3.460985052777495	
This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.	-1.4583263157828414	-1.1186553975881444	-0.6227728595711184	-0.598328563280347	-0.4061552029342452	-0.3967136170600549	-0.3623288407121627	-0.3382833933860775	-0.11114446139297454	-0.1079338951110387	-0.05127516999026943	-0.017090656677112126	0.14468517435657693	0.16556310505338756	0.19474637264136102	0.24253506822119164	0.2915648473582379	0.30720671877925604	0.3986428741658706	0.5273873297866927	1.208425421396263	1.2899107512232584	1.3430805728305997	1.3743223407751712	1.5711603122431788	
This film lacked something I couldn't put my finger on at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress. This inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man. Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play. It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just don't know.<br /><br />But could it have been the screenplay? Just exactly who was the chef in love with? He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits, than of anybody or anything else. He never convinced me he was in love with the princess.<br /><br />I was disappointed in this movie. But, don't forget it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.	-5.112278681220917	-2.455529718860678	-2.1942231322538785	-1.8287669058664802	-1.7511776929524832	-1.4391195394487815	-1.4041488498574786	-0.7282889412922229	-0.3006736132039456	-0.18195984499491918	-0.07975193223017703	0.014751095269031414	0.03679057096775765	0.05908390672196648	0.15829299396904115	0.3197181646669156	0.3212051659140704	0.5646147570513602	0.622142126349658	0.7370641303059657	0.8937409873840068	1.152647457764843	2.415752869539599	2.6337229108799556	5.785707531863744	
"What's his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear."<br /><br />That gag still gets me, TWENTY ONE years after the film was released.<br /><br />I loved the film back then and I love it today. I must have watched this a hundred times back in the day, and when I bought the DVD recently I could still remember some of the dialogue.<br /><br />Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit. When she gets out she decides to seek revenge.<br /><br />Griffin Dunne (whatever happened to him?), plays an attorney for his fiancée's father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations programme. A seemingly easy task, but there are complications aplenty, some funny dialogue, and some admittedly stupid-but-funny scenes along the way.<br /><br />Madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until I was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me (hence only 8/10), but on the other hand I can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice.<br /><br />This film shows Madonna's comic side (too lacking these days, perhaps), and she genuinely is funny in the role. Dunne makes a great foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as the uppity fiancée.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more.	-2.548909146006319	-2.4364644329571155	-2.248298775988763	-1.6214192294923482	-0.9634770113264012	-0.9264864883851709	-0.8076205979655828	-0.6132679397151926	-0.5386701396459551	-0.16543073272002562	-0.09593580146020542	-0.04200100648401132	0.14406519554953684	0.21916352217461413	0.22807778493319933	0.30068060976379907	0.30487157926523284	0.47255574855912263	0.573247688211799	1.3137977335176994	1.445062407535798	2.227656471038745	2.4422168245636064	2.609678270828142	4.935669280052928	
Randy Bowers (John Wayne) comes upon the Half Way House at just the right time to take a break from the trail, and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside, among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - Ed Rogers, proprietor of the establishment. He's observed by the dead man's niece Sally (Alberta Vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where she remained unobserved during the carnage.<br /><br />"Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, where he fast forwards the action from one location to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. It's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era Lone Star Westerns.<br /><br />Pre-Gabby George Hayes is on hand, sans whiskers, and this is the first time I've seen him as a villain. In fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role, first as hunchbacked businessman "Matt the Mute", communicating via pencil and paper, only to turn into Marvin Black, leader of a gang of outlaws. Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House, in an attempt to coerce Sally into selling out to Matt/Marvin. Another staple player is here as well, Yakima Canutt as a Black henchman named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser/Wayne oater, "Neath the Arizona Skies".<br /><br />There's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between Black's Gang and the Sheriff's posse, as John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end, he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers' thirty thousand dollars, at the expense of destroying the Half Way House, where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe. Greedy Marvin Black attempts to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain. In his best "Aw shucks" attitude, John Wayne falls under the spell of the pretty Sally Rogers, and alas, Randy rides alone no more!	-5.544955670605728	-2.838539861148334	-2.737211605302456	-1.8789701416976712	-1.8421837198352977	-1.8291072520822986	-1.8280729553944455	-0.4094091982850142	-0.3249421711611885	-0.09725765259035221	-0.09684414379183055	-0.020011810003229255	0.028685536573373135	0.23446505348504426	0.3429877469293061	0.7203327556460809	0.7648201574779863	0.7671939421080068	0.8795172828137257	1.044404480109312	1.402465633970303	1.4160104582692319	1.6491868703885506	3.7419472148941164	6.979072315638705	
I felt this film did have many good qualities. The cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story. The original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and I felt most played quite convincingly, of course they are playing themselves, but definitely unique. The cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the Chinese and Oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent/child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use. I found the Jia Hongsheng story interesting. On a down note, the story is in Beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001, so it's really cheesy sometimes (the Beatles crap, etc). Whatever, not a top ten or twenty but if it's on the television, check it out.	-2.0918614389929298	-1.3196847448914162	-1.275740613353196	-0.7502353005054841	-0.7201511534102403	-0.30092659324830945	-0.27338636321925364	-0.180915101053926	-0.16816712044900747	-0.10473760566781824	-0.03713903927383022	0.19869369443987261	0.3248896080696757	0.348052993101696	0.3669140626177864	0.422720027139558	0.5326758684601715	0.544051413773511	0.5596557699766205	0.5957876722971571	0.7600322663717047	1.160355863728373	1.7425107310637258	2.06810534426491	2.189817763225665	
This show is a perfect example of how the CBC should stick to either news, sports, or satirical sketch comedy. As a developer of situation comedy, CBC has shown it can combine the pizazz of "King of Kensington" with the belly laughs of "The Beachcombers". It is an embarrassment to great shows like "Kids in the Hall" and "Second City" that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production.<br /><br />I have to admit, that I didn't give this show much of a chance right from when I first heard of its concept. To start, half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip-off one of the few sitcom successes in English-Canadian history, "Corner Gas". The rest of the concept--the cultural clash--is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness. The selection of the Muslim religion as the basis for the "fish out of water" characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be "edgy" and "topical", but comes off as forced. Some of the jokes that are based around the local's reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved, especially the audience.<br /><br />This show is a perfect example of how CBC just doesn't "get it" when it comes to creating Canadian content, especially when presenting Canada as a multicultural environment. Cultural diversity in Canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy-handed and forced way. It would be a refreshing change to see CBC introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity. I doubt that CBC has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle. A comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in Corner Gas--i.e. the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines. More realistically, their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics.<br /><br />That being said, even as a formulaic fish-out-of-water comedy this show fails. The acting is weak, the comic pacing all over the map, and the story premises that I saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief, even for a comedy. The only saving grace is the talented Derek McGrath, who is horribly wasted here. I doubt that even the addition of guest stars (Colin Mochrie, for example, as an Anglican archbishop) can save this dog. I decided to give the show a chance once the CBC's 'hype' had died down; but two episodes were all I could stand--I could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline. The time-slot would be better served by airing more Coronation Street, Air Farce re-runs, or Dr. Who. Even an infomercial would be an improvement.	-11.548889791114533	-5.752986980898839	-5.248183423436119	-5.047800842409874	-4.877011961442173	-3.103882586696942	-2.4106431855725954	-0.9819720365201242	-0.8619410927797506	-0.774144396055756	-0.7540671681794825	-0.6437504514300237	-0.4844053507373882	0.3847487133822364	0.7403741473920302	0.8664386220393554	1.0028909746514711	1.2090607800853486	1.213515860570469	1.2163699863925352	1.4939464111116116	2.4592378225920557	4.049563671987023	6.255253787639447	12.456462789413635	
Am I the only person who believes this American version is far better than the 1934 English film? The English version has no suspense, looks antique and very low budget, and has unexceptional acting (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, besides having top production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect 'innocent' American abroad, and gives Doris Day her best role ever. Of particular note is the music - the music of the American film is almost classic; compare the "Albert Hall' sequences of both, and you will agree that the Bernard Herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version (even though it's basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.	-2.151430883025979	-1.359605871725311	-1.2624027917689313	-0.9870977135222496	-0.7245306533125075	-0.5612809164790881	-0.5189057565129024	-0.5037615409263688	-0.21530875606166305	-0.13597342402310553	0.0037425185423790586	0.07328761485130114	0.08644331882191272	0.12301340095820032	0.5275359650028582	0.556853405434705	0.5594151231297074	0.7914622110604004	0.8361893098598013	0.8427601159149815	0.9283610129076317	1.095129674515997	1.5554996692862002	1.9617984943339772	2.5945630653800302	
Nicole Finn (Madonna) is just being released from prison. Although she is ordered to go by bus to Philadelphia, she wants to stick around the place she was arrested. This is because she claims she has information that would clear her record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law. Louden will be driving around the city anyway (in his future mother in law's Rolls Royce), picking up the wedding ring and a rare big, big cat for an eccentric collector. Nicki, however, starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the Rolls to take over the driving. Between big cats, taxi drivers, hit men, bridesmaids, and a wedding cake with guns, lawyer Louden knows he's not in Kansas anymore. Is there a way out of the madness? This film is a wild trip down comedy avenue. Madonna and Dunneare perfect foils to each other, making their connection uproarious, as they play out their roles as an ex-con and an uptight, button-down lawyer, respectively. The script is laudable in it's ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one, and the next. Everything secondary, from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes, are also quite nice. If you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy, rent this movie for them. You will both be cheerio pronto.	-3.0943877753974793	-2.1594846488782187	-1.7896327027208285	-1.5213347599319937	-0.7458043132889731	-0.7387463783708925	-0.6408883844208534	-0.4996420607546279	-0.08391231529530922	-0.057900276467085926	-0.025751496734006264	-0.015279718828013041	0.16379041324204446	0.16456604097098504	0.19070639576722487	0.19726362340446307	0.27082637398809845	0.7051166161184298	0.8198261517165142	0.8401051533517048	0.9591246874517388	1.105989379241882	2.2141198200222654	2.3283141646610725	4.4101053657151565	
I grew up on the 'Superman II' theatrical version ("S2T") and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman-type villains, it started off with a bang  the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes. Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen, as in part I. Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T (See: my review.) I've always heard of the back-story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original's director, Richard Donner from part II. (It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3 for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut (or, "S2RD") I still can't fully recommend it. Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2T's opening. In fact, they all but wrote the words: "Previously on Superman" in S2RD. The special effects weren't great in either Part I or S2T , but S2RD, they were mostly downright laughable  such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window. I will admit, some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures, such as any scene in the "honeymoon suite." Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as 'I.' This is not only a lazy, unoriginal copout, it doesn't make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner, if those events never actually happened. And will he continue to "turn back time" for every confrontation?	-2.7524733035917723	-2.324410269866512	-2.2225410473605223	-2.194847955728498	-1.5327386618440566	-1.4088150068230563	-0.811256654743843	-0.5801376540729393	-0.5539022231916426	-0.45042362125866975	-0.33969280289742987	-0.16992518495350373	-0.11778658308733062	0.018867756058606112	0.1716744336857528	0.27361652715160134	0.48701489216463634	0.5633593613089762	0.725389533774913	0.8069862276957227	0.9957772213780581	1.3621909143271511	1.5180606942127042	2.4578060338692613	5.027357723347596	
You'd think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter that this film would have been a lot better. Sadly, the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain-addled.<br /><br />The film begins with Ingrid Bergman coming to work for the Stoddard family. Everything is so very peachy and swell--the family adores Bergman and things couldn't be more perfect. Well, that is until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market crashes in 1907 (wiping out the family's fortune) and Bergman is forced to go back home to France. This portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet, but not bad.<br /><br />Later, after the family's fortunes have improved, Bergman returns. The four boys are now all grown and there isn't really a conceivable reason why they'd hire her once again as a governess. But, briefly, everything is swell once again. But, when WWI occurs, the four all go to war--gosh! In the midst of this, one of the sons (David) brings home his new wife (Susan Hayward). Miss Hayward's character is as black and white as the others, though while they are all good and swell, she's obviously a horny she-devil. To make things worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war.<br /><br />Now here is where the movie gets really, really dumb--brain-achingly dumb. Hayward begins an affair with one of David's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY?! Why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman? This was exactly the sort of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the gutter-snipe once and for all! This is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad...and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941.<br /><br />The rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for Hayward's evilness to be exposed. This just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess. As expected, however, the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again---happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut, Hayward.<br /><br />The film suffers because of poor writing. Hayward's affair made no sense--at least in how it was handled. And, having characters who are so gosh-darn good or evil (with nothing in between) sinks this movie to the level of a second-rate soap. The only thing that saves it at all is the acting---they tried as best they could with a turgid script. Suffice to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken!	-13.712211255154871	-6.827669696098951	-6.455042528391065	-6.29146839933916	-5.800451791763499	-3.940257905325669	-3.5276166691526347	-0.7810861259666773	-0.5537116377462349	-0.4917934691915707	-0.4114965217881251	-0.3670616739227015	0.13461649050897187	0.13861476279354032	1.1466685764348123	1.2733814028522386	1.350205737201538	1.475969554418358	1.4884493320624514	1.7841487548940693	1.977359909261397	2.6078217148286416	4.96368972733088	8.18284903079762	15.441313006009025	
Almost certainly the best Three Stooges short with Shemp, 'Brideless Groom' is as good as any of the trio's best shorts featuring Curly. Memorable Stooge moments abound. The opening with 'Professor' Shemp giving voice lessons to homely, untalented and lascivious Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances, is an excellent example of Shemp Howard at his best. Many considered him the most naturally funny of the Stooges.<br /><br />Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him get spiffed up to find a wife (and claim $500,000), Shemp thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror gets flipped backward. Fixing the mirror, he cries with relief, "THERE I amand pretty as a picture!" "Yea," Moe quickly replies, trying to hem his slacks, "of an APE!"<br /><br />The best scene (and maybe Shemp's best with the trio) comes when he pays a call on attractive young Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). Mistaking him for long-lost "Cousin Basil," she smothers him with hugs and kisses (also leading to a hilarious bit between Moe and Larry in the hall), not giving him a chance to explain his true identity. Suddenly the REAL Cousin Basil calls and she goes berserk, slapping him repeatedly and accusing him of taking advantage of "a poor . helplessdefenseless  woman!" That final line is delivered as she socks him in the jaw (with a real punch, according to Shemp and crew members), knocking him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly executed gag. "What happened, kid?" Moe asks. "Can I help it if I ain't Cousin Basil?" Shemp asks before passing out.<br /><br />Other classic bits include Moe and Shemp getting tangled in a phone booth, trying to find a lost coin, Larry getting slapped because of Shemp's bad looks (his face pressed against the phone booth glass), and the great girl fight in the Justice of the Peace's apartment. The great Emil Sitka delivers his classic line (inscribed on his tombstone), "Hold hands, you love birds" over and over as his apartment is trashed.<br /><br />I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years ended when Curly left. True, Shemp didn't have as MANY great shorts with the group as Curly, but that was due to an increasing lack of support from Columbia and his (and the others') advancing ages. When Shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with, they were still on the top of their game.	-5.578338470402975	-3.984456776841078	-3.2980258456174765	-2.2653636013102405	-2.097679112864778	-2.0186864159145705	-1.221036672354526	-0.8909548252134926	-0.634208306527973	-0.49247676443450683	-0.2960146628314966	-0.2818481380125697	-0.18840166209554798	-0.15342882633405927	0.19911109156452236	0.3434832102003707	0.4598531368755403	0.9089327161216394	1.4286049449948874	1.7765787107318256	1.8449692735473635	1.860815678550453	2.204536028998987	4.015266132493233	7.7579591755116155	
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out. Instead, the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity.	-5.643442439557272	-2.514061019286161	-2.0728826929754414	-1.8768211821793124	-1.7088820079681288	-1.7019076562928517	-1.2767289758504101	-0.8217689279253683	-0.595436390189967	-0.5870155377913125	-0.2813220788960934	0.08514485614608498	0.15079695842066687	0.2431021259108975	0.2624701945449815	0.4974768086086225	0.5807905860505511	0.6073209260895468	0.8295893336826603	0.8613510449311945	0.8796442346082468	1.0394503767864185	1.766061534543037	2.6816167615903947	5.93354602314756	
Although "They Died with their Boots On" is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western. Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer, the character actors are superb. Besides the action portion of the movie Flynn and DeHavilland's love scenes are very touching and believable.(Flynn and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life). Flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!	-0.8952746369301314	-0.8225813499545922	-0.5998607847645734	-0.5869296934853789	-0.26599575224909	-0.1377382937824792	-0.12379312723489337	-0.0821203496886228	-0.040429475425843034	-0.02071051409857895	-0.01628862056059875	0.035371157238546086	0.17471053183861618	0.20170368485171009	0.2152330880776009	0.23199039626494278	0.24190340436410426	0.28098509397729887	0.30289238272649444	0.4915481578281564	0.6019109898729729	0.7047851754419378	0.8882532311958484	1.4184657536243708	1.7132749399359162	
CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In reality, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.<br /><br />The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured. This was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side, and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges. The taking of the bridge was a complete success, and meant the that the end of the war was near, and would not last through the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it. They knew how vital the battle was.<br /><br />This film has little to do with real history. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced.	-5.243218611305658	-2.2022605909305994	-1.5624713096624523	-1.5125955838351939	-1.46633218025054	-1.2371413426922813	-1.018475482687998	-1.017494670688028	-0.6631569828483819	-0.6468956043593793	-0.37974554929803744	0.2088998220874519	0.23188087326021425	0.40890366517595517	0.4243649541231138	0.4395111305356292	0.570648378371724	0.5873010218697787	0.6094662949917214	0.7519544671151792	0.7542907372777963	1.1535171461673195	2.1460766924144226	2.1656967969369	5.479318284135192	
A strong woman oriented subject after long, director Krishna Vamsi's Shakti- The Power, the Desi version of the Hollywood hit Not Without My Daughter is actress Sridevi's first home-production. A story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice.<br /><br />The story of the film revolves around Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) who lives in Canada with her two uncles (Tiku Talsania, Jaspal Bhatti). There she meets Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), falls in love with him and they soon marry. Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja (Master Jai Gidwani). But their happiness is short lived, as the news of Shekhar's ailing mother (Deepti Naval)makes them leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India. And that's when the problems start. From the moment they reach<br /><br />India, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere. They take a crowded train to reach Shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village. The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never-ending drive. And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus. Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him. After that, they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhar''s father, Narsimha (Nana Patekar) lives with his wife (Deepti Naval). Nandani realized that her father-in-law is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her mother-in-law's warm welcome.<br /><br />Living there, Nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him. The day she sees her father-in-law teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada. But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father-in-law. Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart-wrenching film.<br /><br />What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie. The only drawback is Ismail Darbar''s music, which fails to rise above the script. The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik. Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast. Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother. She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal. Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film. His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role. Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors. Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Pr-climax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy. Shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value. Though his role was not really required, he's done it well. Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening. Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up. So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact. Shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch!	-8.799092996282702	-6.187554951991668	-5.516614104420533	-4.714518874515236	-3.277921936379475	-2.734635068600301	-1.9088778284074885	-0.550362518025697	-0.28176140142446965	-0.20145908464547196	-0.09330464909846989	0.06769406136444807	0.1314825285337731	0.33426039914410316	0.45910271718553	0.5656698288753089	1.391155424871596	1.71905715605519	2.1821092463440315	2.2345919223288955	2.307795365200949	3.20864571457333	5.238238309045953	7.306494590387167	13.678081429546026	
Reba is , without a doubt , one of the worst "comedy" series ever. I wonder how come there are people writing good comments on "Reba" ... You watch "Friends" , "Married Wtih Children" , "Fraizer" if you laugh at that , you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever. The actors/actresses beside Reba are OK so I feel bad for them stucking in a so-called comedy show with the least funnies person in the world (Reba).To sum up , I suggest this TV Show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh	-3.03728160336896	-1.682344367650232	-1.6640512662057745	-1.422610041254348	-1.1315771015799196	-0.7620733478335554	-0.6983786870181778	-0.40556304577729996	-0.2564118891448243	-0.14983811665471167	-0.14737489599914286	-0.1048204341685542	-0.09465773972343446	-0.04380124763934405	-0.03533366242445261	-0.026649155896560403	-0.016600449861388294	0.11300737985667991	0.18684090169060863	0.4494632933902098	0.5729784291468822	0.6406203802057899	1.3174286303196943	1.599234576200971	3.062465066177283

After The Funeral was absolutely superb, and by far the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with Cards On the Table, that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour, and I didn't know what to think of Taken After the Flood, though I do remember being confused at the end. After the Funeral as I've said is one of my all time favourite Poirot episodes, up there with Five Little Pigs, Sad Cypress and The ABC Murders. I was afraid that they would ruin the story, but instead it is very faithful to the book. Now I will say I don't mind changes to books, and try not to compare movies and TV adaptations to their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn't do it justice. That's why I disliked some of the Marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far out of the Poirots The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Taken At the Flood and Cards on the Table are the only ones that really did disappoint. Everything else ranges from good to outstanding, even the recent Appointment with Death, despite the many deviations from the book, which I admit isn't a favourite, was surprisingly good, thanks to the marvellous production values, stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score. Back to After the Funeral, the production values are fantastic. It has a really cinematic feel to it, and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes. The music was very stirring and even haunting, and the entire cast give wonderful performances. David Suchet is impeccable as always as Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as terrific. But for me, the standout was Monica Dolan as Mrs Gilchrist, she is up there with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actor/actress in a Poirot episode, that's how good her performance was. All in all, a must see, one of the best Poirot episodes by far, and one of the more faithful ones too. 10/10 Bethany Cox	-3.9341716316751856	-3.604432383945758	-2.8229705206787887	-2.6843251904966325	-2.413628581677532	-1.5454689457215605	-0.7167056862176762	-0.5809362529073355	0.001556049992889592	0.05968013415929055	0.3291825954854579	0.46279946153694457	0.5495302564340945	0.5683593213526636	0.6995934162732089	0.7204887317688664	1.0163497412464828	1.378678033173374	2.1419362522933096	2.4385244858360537	3.063198301646528	3.363825120351157	4.637621414081942	4.875784901670932	6.268662486407705	
"Quitting" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. As a rural guy coming to Beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. Troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.<br /><br />But what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director Zhang Yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. No clichés, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. <br /><br />Hongshen Jia is in his mid-twenties. He's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. The perfect recipe for his enablers. Soon he's the "cool" actor, idolized by youth. "He was hot in the early nineties." "He always had to be the most fashionable." He needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts, friends--and roles, But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- "I didn't know how to act" "I felt like a phony"--and to readily available drugs to counter them. He says "I had to get high to do what director wanted." So, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. <br /><br />Hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. The abstract is out. And a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of Beijing. The physicality is almost romantic, but is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. He drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. "I started to open up" he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. If mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. <br /><br />Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and TV, and bangs his head till bloody against his "John Lennon Forever" poster. He has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he's the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as John's son (Yoko Ono), and adopts his "Mother Mary" as an intercessor in his "hour of darkness" and "time of trouble." (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) "Music is so much more real than acting" he says. And speaks of Lennon's influence as "showing me a new way." In the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room.<br /><br />If Lennon's influence is spiriting, Hongshen's father's influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is Fegsen's differences from his son that underwrites his change. For the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he's Chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. It's this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: "all the acts I acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit." And to Hongshen's emphatic "you are NOT my father," he softly replies, "why can't a peasant be your father?" <br /><br />Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. As the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. Integrity banishes his black cloud. All his edges soften. "You are just a human being" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. Back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. And his once "rare and true friendships" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. Hongshen says of this movie: "it's a good chance to think about my life." And I might add, become a New Actor, one bound to art and life. Like Lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.	-15.8715194946703	-10.275158009972461	-7.9840748009645655	-7.168577211626005	-5.176802885799187	-4.430055759511576	-3.703640689637157	-3.4782758510100864	-3.1113686582981	-0.8327411246248314	-0.4346353988331655	0.34440226898766013	0.3504658805651356	0.6573352163406394	1.6468032857591122	1.8560392161476125	2.366076686347453	3.086080190400374	3.5651980745141105	3.9258654420922174	3.9776157867051847	4.298296190212779	6.643315967027565	10.624140866000108	19.72785254679361	
Since Paul Kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge, the third installment in the "Death Wish" saga revolves on him returning to New York to visit an old war buddy. He arrives only to find out that Brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. Kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond attorney, blows away numerous villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, there's no more point in defending the "Death Wish" series after seeing part three. The 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and, even though it was pure exploitation, part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first. Number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise. Apparently, Kersey isn't an architect anymore, he's ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody, not even the police, is against vigilante actions anymore? All these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their "Death Wish" success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series, with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode, armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier, sleazier, meaner and a lot harder to kill. However, the gentlemen didn't seem to realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to "Death Wish 3" as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation. This description couldn't be more spot-on, as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next. Particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete "orgy" of gunfire, explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures. Yi-Haaa! This entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Plot", "The Longest Yard") as the slightly unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.	-5.267871020111821	-3.0929784607635553	-2.6280431638795783	-2.562573003604929	-2.32386208534218	-1.9501156465229872	-1.3886934124180754	-1.0333182888714378	-0.5458274366697389	-0.21795000327359426	-0.16983892764765862	-0.1101177523034866	0.06510492327605377	0.18137227024054967	0.303944620266975	0.4273849886163035	0.45995783969891657	0.5877356300529004	0.8473014930239429	1.0847637861015682	1.324325872025257	1.368579326997966	1.444566588903398	3.081517005331939	6.7397716943353005	
This movie was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. It was poorly made and the actors couldn't act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own. The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case. It appears that the director or make-up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie. Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie. This was honestly an awful movie and I couldn't believe how badly it was put together. Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like "whats going on?" The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene.<br /><br />IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is. I wish i would have watched it before i rented it.	-7.815746805769035	-3.8620787112120514	-3.549009814851015	-3.5074167337741198	-3.3818000285758356	-2.431347263765905	-2.089849017989022	-0.679535014657908	-0.6562540955346498	-0.6015457781577973	-0.473692545625099	-0.42618664909014503	0.1700140010615435	0.37226487088865773	0.575732104307899	0.6461392910761613	0.6784141178902267	0.8641614295108648	0.8772108101873428	0.9052022761599954	1.0837285619270716	1.7852414407267168	2.4994204045121227	4.726483719655894	8.550097650608414	
Now I've seen it all. Just when I thought it couldn't get any more pathetic and cheesy than "Woodchipper Massacre," just when I thought dialogue and acting couldn't get worse than "Nail Gun Massacre," just when I thought "Don't Go In The Woods" would retain its title as Lousiest Slasher Film Ever, along comes "THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY!" Somehow, this cheap, wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness, but it remains terrible! I couldn't believe my eyes--for once I can't complain about excessive (or in this case, any) nudity in a slasher film, but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it. Never before have I seen such horrible acting, dialect, direction, writing,....I could go on forever with this list! Here's a quick run-down:<br /><br />A mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin, dresses up like a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives, and breaks in while the doctor's daughter is having friends over for the night. Then begins the most stupid killing spree (ripped off from other movies such as "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween") this side of the universe. The characters have negative IQs, which suggests they are not human. Then again, I guess they are not, since they have the tendency to bleed Kool-Aid when they get cut, as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his scapel to the camera in WAY too many scenes. It is only 80 minutes...how many times must we look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie?...which I suppose wouldn't be all that bad of an idea in this case! There is one moment where I thought maybe, just maybe, the director would make it interesting (a second killer was added), but alas! It was not to be! And then to insult even further, there is a stupid super cop-out sub-ending and an even stupider final conclusion. That probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but I would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools (like me) dumb enough to rent this sewage.<br /><br />I sure hope that, by writing this, I have saved 80 minutes of someone's life. I get on my hands and knees to beg anyone still thinking about renting this: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T! This is a fan of the slasher genre talking; I know what is good for you! The only real victims in this rattlebrained, asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank! Zanatos's score...since there is no negative point scale, I have to give it a 1, but a below-average 1 at that. Avoid it at all costs....please!!!!	-10.887264464872661	-6.003558380879	-5.2305250459427475	-4.919656750675716	-4.468475673498678	-3.93313935761977	-3.120172338094468	-1.0766414990218798	-0.7672764597266348	-0.20327679830513717	-0.11883072529346037	-0.11102150154078903	-0.09867312676590913	0.0684809891799975	0.5426123045970743	0.9110351663230278	1.0647572714159246	1.080715792584071	1.153263334889072	1.6169725949226186	2.1406316285371325	3.0364906502343305	3.8977439071506432	7.025660382703135	12.706454952331532	
Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now only seems to do "by the numbers" Hollywood thrillers.<br /><br />This is very lightweight John Grisham material, crossed with the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they make an uncomfortable duo. Not good, when two unbalanced college maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them on a wild goose chase - by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene.<br /><br />Fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create any sparks, we also have to endure a several dull overly-melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in Cass's history. Then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff-side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the OTT ending will be set. Oooh... the atmosphere.<br /><br />Watch any episode of CSI instead. It's to the point and far more exciting.	-3.6461681928944785	-1.895205093383514	-1.6174718481601666	-1.4322173525670903	-1.1675839377386485	-0.9589462813197267	-0.8306116547042692	-0.6476446203843275	-0.2845727792042891	-0.1987945385521127	-0.16329132502241334	-0.07578682549556641	0.03885117760509332	0.059937770367123076	0.06476834357916667	0.4423780621591438	0.48027083104552415	0.48799113752273804	0.5295345771975499	0.5958668349874974	0.6572153323840396	0.6720404881045912	0.7973373707013325	2.1488609606284794	4.164770147033509	
Cuba Gooding,Jr. will win the Oscar for BEST ACTOR in 2003.And Ed Harris will win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR. What a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn't get to you, then you have ice water in your veins.<br /><br />It was 1976. The setting was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years old. We have a white high school football coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow, Cuba Gooding, whose greatest possessions, including a radio, are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle.<br /><br />Ed Harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film. He gives Cuba the nickname "Radio" and what follows is an absoutely riveting, engrossing, poignant exploration of the human soul.<br /><br />The movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.	-3.0648296390483263	-2.650542013417937	-1.2189160746582228	-0.76695264483377	-0.746393011521036	-0.19812415887151572	-0.09838721337583006	-0.06054565707130049	-0.019613108689138403	-0.012660348596470722	0.0709906870007995	0.15421941654015842	0.18608424498526818	0.35512703721565453	0.4513503112774526	0.5090076347319884	0.6044825011125404	0.7063364358322297	0.7196166584097449	0.7992471788898422	1.173043461556817	1.2270683499875776	1.469248090658823	1.5172456848289935	2.8156130213366755	
Im warning you people out there, this is just a waste of your time. I am being honest when I'm saying that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Its just a move about Christian propaganda! Don't throw away your life, don't see it!<br /><br />I think they made the movie so more people will believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. The actors are all newbies, the story is just fuzzy!<br /><br />I think this movie is a work of the devil. <br /><br />This movie is just not worth seeing, so please take my advice and don't!	-2.4234491468319446	-1.7361339041323474	-1.4346413137149072	-1.1369473682332631	-0.9950259932957601	-0.7873575596501102	-0.35802714842582634	-0.3572334601917363	-0.27713333138644775	-0.2643298760839301	-0.1624562505957841	-0.11372895325595922	-0.09551741196733148	-0.03768345369024243	0.12073193655166461	0.22741306211275042	0.24850380033873878	0.32148931464357156	0.39058935988520377	0.7167824887029732	0.7523455233346072	0.8960655136597007	0.9553462963134092	1.7267304678780873	3.470809790591689	
This was one of the best half-hour horror/suspense/fantasy shows of the eighties, without a doubt. Granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode, and it stank as far as production values (i.e. the sets) went, but darn it I have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots. I mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even I, a hardened horror movie, shock-film, and 70's grind-house buff got a little sickened and creeped out. Great show, just great, regardless of what the other reviewers have said here. My favorite episode was called "Bug House", yeah that was the title I think? Anyhow it still gives me the willies every time I think about it to this day, almost 20 years after it first premiered. Other shows like "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were definitely better production values-wise, but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show! It definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was, "Tales From The Crypt".	-1.8236241493063037	-1.7723850987589977	-1.4769301037355702	-1.412640463978318	-1.0875938435081731	-0.8495997892603085	-0.6428558127712498	-0.5722348772631103	-0.4936347839759855	-0.1364007474318611	0.027063597515463715	0.05472725615224896	0.08374767160605068	0.0940733693633179	0.1495913097981107	0.19339660641681378	0.4748250621299467	0.5142375018142132	0.7478850802841464	0.841025629035455	1.0677331911739016	1.306804087634177	1.5689860880520015	2.335016922154259	3.4195360113355924	
I loved this film. Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his "boundless enthusiasm" and acknowledge his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain. I hoped, and was delighted to find, that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life, rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise. From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr.<br /><br />What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Ed's. We get insight into Ed's personal and professional life: from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.<br /><br />The film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful (sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President). The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.<br /><br />Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.<br /><br />Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him (for better or worse), to the point where one woman will go down in history as "Swimming Pool Owner" for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool. This ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created. Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.<br /><br />Even the title hints at the B-list horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Wood's legend.<br /><br />In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get. Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.	-6.9875192272644515	-4.215092865159921	-2.752622001687646	-2.2930896819517046	-2.033988854690568	-0.8467273408723041	-0.4387884014299522	0.3129032530466794	0.4493023388335412	0.5173795417855046	0.5893389553165573	0.6671788551567943	1.0557646287373776	1.0622508526095782	1.4130390801604593	1.703566192182929	1.721878315811956	1.9014175781531308	2.1091958704906886	2.3821255240899566	2.44459505803658	3.289291467317015	4.517792921783382	5.169656814366882	6.768381109723216	
When it comes to movies I can be pretty picky, and I'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. While every movie has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count.<br /><br />If you read the last review (it was hard, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie), you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review, you discovered the poster's reason for disdain: he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack...apparently).<br /><br />So, despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. Let's go over a quick checklist first: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I won't give a shred of it away, but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. The story really will amaze you, even more so because it's true (and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events).<br /><br />2. Wonderful Acting? Oh Yes. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast, and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago. He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well, I'll let you see for yourself.<br /><br />3. Excellent direction? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster to which I referred, I actually know something about direction. I've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. Of course I really don't think that makes a lick of difference (the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction), but I thought I should simply establish once again that I'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL).<br /><br />Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of "tension and release" rather than the messy, fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today. Some people can truly show you a story through their camera, while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.<br /><br />4. Lighting, cinematography, and editing? Great all around. I've already wrote so much, and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I'll just wrap it up.<br /><br />In short, go see this movie. Don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben	-5.51420302075632	-4.151907749665037	-3.8026403506282977	-3.758878571968377	-3.6291785035167377	-1.5798091477608434	-1.1921512431334542	-0.8556348988809949	-0.8092306131396081	-0.7357154289446467	-0.552978542609212	-0.4784349343189649	-0.4220414199130541	-0.40970172008893874	-0.20134257535140113	-0.06658098792734504	0.02803559228968553	0.04412250737270337	1.6202399375966117	2.56770634872587	3.7069834937953234	4.329580081349097	5.498640043870341	5.796128128295696	7.573496317946062	
Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor's efforts. A formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it's promise, which this film does not. It is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past. It is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action, such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains (unexplainedly) follow them. This was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous, with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other. It makes one believe that somebody told Becket there was a ghost town in the Chilean foothills and he said, "Oh great, lets do a shoot out scene there."<br /><br />Don't even waste your rental money on this. It is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama.	-5.82172653994296	-3.1819345504952734	-2.986142056331253	-2.500436647027644	-2.154690982376113	-1.8245518112985235	-1.778407525488332	-0.6495985608598104	-0.36997542745749945	-0.34795647914140987	-0.27567364498462127	-0.2474346712952029	-0.18449721848661924	-0.07866702660425831	0.16344467757334605	0.23611304341191958	0.24267479615973364	0.37683266756223127	0.4235059865651851	1.0503738582711515	1.1432056196597458	1.1481162551815034	2.9093208444463414	3.041436406434865	6.007536171617408	
Honestly before I watched this movie, I had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace. I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken roles in this movie, and watched it by my own. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell did I watch this movie.<br /><br />Of course I was not expecting much from Justin as he really does not belong in the movie/theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in Edison. To be honest, their roles are rather stupid.<br /><br />Well you might think if the players suck, then I should pay more attention to the story. It is indeed story is the core of a movie, but guys... trust me... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story. Imagine this, a smart-ass journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). This all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice (LL Cool J) and an brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). At the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story.<br /><br />Jeez, I could not even carry on with this. Just recalling the movie is making me sick already. My advise guys, don't watch this! Please save your money and time for another movie.	-7.049853897005082	-3.431303830217767	-3.0300373121965225	-2.974280610743039	-2.5571626757892925	-2.4456494042881163	-2.329050945455052	-1.1682378443480625	-0.5197637951984535	-0.2839466649863237	-0.24317329386852796	0.1378005544449735	0.1422483220425773	0.1449219242929437	0.21200393000732648	0.4192589169524779	0.6549703044226812	1.1306147358896292	1.1915473346032313	1.265765419717942	1.5195340030905102	1.6598043337784913	2.3519823245968863	4.041906329403533	8.634196637043791	
I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the "Fat Guys At the Movies." The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt I've ever called a movie "stupid" but that was the first word that came to mind about one-third in and stayed in my mind until the end.<br /><br />Where to begin? Unbelievable premise and reactions, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or I'll just blame both) and enormously bad acting. I'd sooner believe Bill Pullman as President of the USA than a FBI agent here. (Of course, there's a reason for that, and I'll partially go into that.) And to top it off, if you can't figure the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late. Don't worry, they'll tell you the "twist" every five minutes thereafter.<br /><br />There's been some serial killer(s) on the loose in the most depressing town in the county, or world. But there's more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement. Could there possibly be more? Oh, yeah, there's a family, well maybe not, but there are four humans, one boy, one girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees dead people in The Sixth Sense. There's gotta be more to this than what I mentioned! That's what makes a movie interesting! Adding as many subplots that may/may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, then I'll continue. We have goofy FBI agents that made me laugh. A pair of giggling druggies who's shocked at first their dealer OD's but then resorts to robbery. A gosh-tooting great-guy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angry/suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside who didn't just phone his performance in, he barely text it in.<br /><br />None of these work. They're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks, and believe me, you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin. In addition, the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all. I guess I'm referring mostly to the cops, but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks.<br /><br />This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was, unless his exposure has been limited to Goosebumps stories. And what's with the title? Surveillance? Oh, I get it; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to film interviews. Since that's so random, it might as well been called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrid mess.	-13.48082409881207	-7.6532592016073675	-5.467280494459236	-5.353037865574388	-4.890623204254347	-4.828607766800125	-3.796915592002247	-1.747127563917719	-1.5421469800616574	-0.8507414898448896	-0.32135443066863467	-0.08479539169440467	-0.0071288410166570814	0.5215781075598482	1.2625328280313048	1.2809176360650678	1.3733635632752517	1.5894987339747142	1.988798997276491	2.265076697673585	2.3493911436190644	3.1576469835295136	3.7869201235995087	7.925092599579179	14.652123875601834	
If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious!! I am a Madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release. However, over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun. Sure there are some bad lines & cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with Madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast. She is cute,funny, and is the only comedic role of her movie career. Madonna usually just plays 'herself' in roles but watching her as Nikki Finn in this film, she really seems like somebody else for once. Of course the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting 'At Close Range' with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and co-stars Griffin dunn ('After Hours') who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material. The story is nothing genius and don't expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80's romp or if you are a Madonna fan than this is a MUST SEE. The Soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 Madonna songs: the #1 hit "Who's That Girl", the #2 hit "Causing A Commotion" and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads "The Look of Love''(Top 10 Hit in the UK) and "Can't Stop" a left over pop ditty from the 'True BLue' sessions the year before. It is only on VHS but will soon be available on DVD.	-3.334433091073819	-3.0691272900361386	-1.5899012459725121	-1.3713961079116646	-1.3017668985476918	-0.17608323053591288	-0.07960835021340497	-0.07219826445350194	0.011230233623042998	0.24098411143869952	0.2506611784086724	0.28475787622450416	0.4070979572000229	0.5076650727150602	0.5575758804760736	0.6158351167920249	0.6789846953674077	0.6957664896700793	0.9028262247030678	0.9185776675681456	0.9631404383460862	1.47700479235871	2.403488563280181	3.100262465502185	3.519486812121	
Corniness Warning. As many fellow IMDb users already know, I'm not a corny, cheesy person. If you don't want to read this kind of review, then go.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, you're hearing this from a man who laughed through Titanic and almost broke his parents' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene.<br /><br />---Spoilers---<br /><br />One day, I went off to the theatres with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, last year in August. The boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly. It was for Radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I just had to see this movie on opening weekend. When that weekend rolled along, Scary Movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night. It turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie, they went and also sold out Good Boy and Radio. I couldn't get a ticket and the following weeks, I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented Radio. He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room. I'll tell you this now, this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen that got me crying EVER. When Radio's mother died, it just came out automatically. The next day, I went off to Blockbuster and bought the DVD.<br /><br />Well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nick-named Radio. Ed Harris co-stars and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone. He goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around. He's got his own collection. At the end of every day, he goes home to his mother. He never went to school until later in the film. One day, Radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing. A football flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues on. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the football coach. They meet and this is the life of Radio.<br /><br />Throughout the whole movie, Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together, both teaching each other things. It is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows, and just seeing Radio live his life. You will laugh, cry, and live the life of Radio with him. This movie holds a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and others. This is a must-see for the whole family, by yourself, or if you're someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Radio will never be forgotten by me. Never.<br /><br />As Ed Harris' character said greatly near the end of the movie:<br /><br />"We're not teaching Radio, Radio is teaching us."<br /><br />My Rating: 8/10<br /><br />Eliason A.	-7.54092738614651	-7.157118075535568	-6.463806974554011	-4.274686824229553	-2.475637507695561	-1.6054835943297903	-1.5643844717279671	-1.1913218624413957	-0.999179718330855	-0.8629998969615204	-0.48621527627059846	-0.2592912047922442	0.5570994054500417	0.8813049029466928	0.9512540238288952	1.0636933645238074	1.2740083856576285	1.3612265367264733	1.9992539138925605	2.6271582549631516	3.019266505164646	3.3690570359744023	6.940538004538611	7.349214211044908	13.228643368622357	
Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesn't sentimentalise the main characters. David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident.<br /><br />Tennant, as Alan, brings humour as well as a dangerous lecherousness, as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident. Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a clichéd stand-by-her-man housewife who will do anything to support her husband. She struggles with falling out of love with Alan, as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her.<br /><br />Contrary to some opinion, this - in my view - makes perfect Sunday night viewing. Too often, we are shown soft family dramas or detective series, like Heartbeat, which rot and putrefy the brain. Programme commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep. More challenging and thought-provoking drama like Recovery would seriously change the situation.	-2.309538424136368	-1.7748346553709546	-1.6041112362991208	-1.0719672730231669	-0.9953599916353609	-0.7594845588798829	-0.35681313374393875	-0.2194595634665714	-0.12290620583110798	-0.06858076023340492	-0.03844144832078706	-0.017712552432046995	-0.00477437623297435	0.18489680656842244	0.265793691134668	0.4436527482693253	0.5664080283548467	0.6625578119586757	0.6930765556496691	0.7904756246941874	0.9317151236323666	0.9347487508396073	1.808923789034716	2.3857726747570434	3.6353038487014917	
There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing "The Loveliest Night of the Year." <br /><br />It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers' $30,000. Randy is an investigator who "works alone," who wastes little time in getting arrested, escaping (with Ed's daughter Sally's help) and literally landing in the midst of the Black gang's hideout behind a waterfall. It all moves along fairly quickly. Only one too many chases after Randy slow it down.<br /><br />We even get George Hayes, clean shaven and playing two parts-- Marvin Black, the vilest villain, as well as the Good Citizen, Matt the Mute, who communicates via handwritten messages. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast, even for him, as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to Sally, "Ah, I'm fed up with this!" You can find George playing a vile, vile, double crossing villain in the serial "The Lost City" (1934).<br /><br />I think this is the only 'Lone Star' film in which the title relates to, or is mentioned in the film! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, "He's not alone anymore!" Then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake. Sally's running off with Randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for. Too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff.<br /><br />Not that bad considering everything, but not that great either. I'd really give it a 4 and a half.	-7.821162703983478	-3.4027768678165433	-3.229368942264126	-2.9723291657666264	-2.888903696887	-2.195259705477415	-1.200632631824937	-1.0125975135006615	-0.9629334481145185	-0.8679292729361116	-0.7258120354577828	-0.32532103738357643	0.025440173868404248	0.25119801566138084	0.5187482428269317	0.6259529473071375	0.6627117890578792	0.6978202247314318	1.0109013211205833	1.2341065196936398	1.2568743000745595	1.2984184811650996	2.954167495033306	3.6366030770423134	8.035649222853694	
This is a great comedy, highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot. But also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. Based on the hit ITV comedy, this is very politically incorrect. And its all the better for it, comedy after all is to entertain. The movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot. However the cast are as great as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker make one hell of a team, playing off each other in a oneupmanship kind of way.It's been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd. The fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments, means that i can recommend this movie, just like i would of back in the 1970's.	-2.3277269117087807	-2.261831334441362	-1.2139440264927925	-1.2080935399486445	-0.7629546433620804	-0.3694271923442324	-0.1485908768147731	-0.14534125773130546	0.017401211708535175	0.07913705509884338	0.08334740681635577	0.10014786802051584	0.15758243797523777	0.17380892579090224	0.23461301868403223	0.4216035053375543	0.4845349038208123	0.4959817756609736	0.4998365603221891	0.906508932085218	0.9288076542192415	1.169461293570405	1.8620199815447769	2.5243859652056457	2.853533560912743	
I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film.<br /><br />Jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja.<br /><br />Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra.<br /><br />"Tashan" has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched. Yes! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much publicised weight loss) looks good. But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production. With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now.<br /><br />There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well. But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain. Lastly,never mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films such as "Mohabbatein," what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie? <br /><br />Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression.	-6.647717384590611	-3.8061429396467577	-3.7240182221229263	-3.709565128351337	-3.2085127782977434	-1.7322286927993786	-1.6063814834891508	-0.5813683376027949	-0.4849371502530033	-0.2056060692458164	-0.025567265078807765	0.03002571518470895	0.06950033793850886	0.14653713390902984	0.4404920288711787	0.4587236471807298	0.519682065240596	0.5309165405243903	0.6734200698005067	0.7948776748331836	0.8404614238102639	1.2668873219068197	2.079352797343501	4.422926913918836	7.816270133860358	
It's just stories, some we wish happen to us, some we wish never happen to us, all about unfulfilled desire. The locations and nude bodies are beautiful, but after the second story all I could think was 'it takes more than just beauty to create a real film'. Then of course the film unfolds. The stories are moving except Sophie Marceau fails to communicate her story in this film. Malkovich plays the story for both of them though. The voiceover fails to link the stories but helps Malkovich to provoke some thought.<br /><br />I'd say it is worth seeing and the best of Antonioni I have seen. Given his age - remarkable!	-1.1386264806579305	-0.8694719652338474	-0.8507188376894985	-0.7804239772032586	-0.5329193300532409	-0.3008334329330607	-0.2112371949788211	-0.19652298312274497	-0.09962295705776443	-0.04730453469320979	-0.02113866161403899	-0.011237482496421095	0.19501217088549405	0.1968372354506203	0.21365082274638036	0.2508152360964531	0.31960478559262356	0.44789564723220204	0.45979580924861263	0.47565737196122154	0.9455691709117491	1.1914257539562456	1.495760062131188	1.7121252162669323	2.2936060231199695	
Me being from Australia and loving the series, I wasn't expecting much from the American version of Kath and Kim but I thought I'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad.<br /><br />Well,whats there to say. Its nothing special.Selma Blair is OK as Kim and actually had a few good lines, Molly Shannon is not a good Kath though. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (such as when she says Yumor or Noice) it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks, but when Shannon has a go at the accent, its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about, because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are really not funny.<br /><br />So far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the Aussie version, although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name, not being compared to the Aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better. But if there is nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America) then you cant do much harm in watching it, or better put on some of the Aussie version if you've got it.	-3.934267801676131	-1.844365091880694	-1.649497401365475	-1.633511077260903	-1.5928030389166867	-1.5015026564803917	-0.9217543827886051	-0.2588807528172513	-0.1989608985102806	-0.103002176250625	-0.08407105252364265	-0.07571445947265597	-0.04624351068368329	0.0345825601925732	0.03938874883070983	0.08313387537452199	0.24669424681051536	0.38496373076705975	0.394074459913318	0.45759037727165064	0.611810508138378	0.7274659237913758	1.697346827418345	2.2412967133140875	4.394389049869339	
"L'appartement" has to be among the best French films I have ever seen (along with "Hatred", also starring Vincent Cassel, and those great Gerard Dépardieu/Pierre Richard movies). Cassel and Bellucci are amazing in the leading roles. Aside from "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Dobermann" I have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple. "L'appartement" sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end. Fragment storytelling really hasn't worked this well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's just hope there won't be a godawful American remake of this unique romance/mystery-thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! A godawful American remake has been made!)!	-2.2976356563744478	-1.821966807338817	-1.2341412839115176	-1.1947194338778218	-1.101797375298869	-0.7106217231122738	-0.4848977890323706	-0.2770018738146949	-0.07550194971127416	-0.05099927775821533	-0.034864576895314914	0.17471575299113126	0.32281638096590437	0.4289269169210602	0.4308481807793078	0.48401167417780044	0.6334528483771145	0.6617643859170824	0.6769198508708395	0.7774927493624838	0.8712588037688298	0.9989671122433309	1.6431809379521929	1.6943985225887142	2.3240453991990835	
I admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his/her reluctant guardian. I've seen enough of them  Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider  to expect to be bored by the formula. What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting: small-town China in the 1930's. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market. When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he's nicknamed "Doggie," is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she's showed great promise as street-performing heir. Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he's not too upset when she's kidnapped. The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society.<br /><br />The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success. Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense.<br /><br />The peek at small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.	-3.8176340013246306	-3.181032566045026	-2.603578351153056	-2.395885608039819	-1.861399309369253	-1.4640686302349786	-1.0786268830706534	-1.0413982682776153	0.010043140756791025	0.11098712506381082	0.30449929840985546	0.30772943373120715	0.36940959807575335	0.42179208674030966	0.4992499189719081	0.5250840746861247	0.5388136476751332	0.9119944870637731	0.9394503297642659	1.0352343210049	1.1229507110279275	1.1789771414722339	2.9126696394737617	3.70537286508594	6.584863837831954	
I absolutely love this movie. I just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday. This movie brings up several questions. One is. Who are the monsters of this world? To be different is just that. Different. The real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness. They are those that everyone considers "a nice quiet bloke" who "didn't bother anybody". Or they are worse they are the characters such as played by Croneberg. Men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own Books of Blood. I love the shapeshifters, people with gifts and those that may be abhorent for people to look upon. This movie touches on and explores what IS normal. Who are 'other' and what fear does to some. Even though I gave this movie 10 I am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed Median. My other complaint was why didn't they ever make a second film. I for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end	-5.226021497430104	-2.0228172213450732	-1.1523191603505638	-1.1207185075916994	-0.9511084008040593	-0.5359963434873247	-0.40680876256657594	-0.3415707939754903	-0.23012140428572772	-0.18594590112096618	-0.09253474814541982	0.19799665623607998	0.21115445067551092	0.3204097152251432	0.32643574725955943	0.3877844897077252	0.3916105002936828	0.39695354158164187	0.5887343827448874	0.6565786701605413	0.9026449188434172	1.3921463249355877	1.8652544864006246	3.044585705459358	3.332260731967017	
Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I have not had the opportunity to view. By itself, the '56 version is a very well done film. The run of mid-to-late fifties Hitchcock films (including "Rear Window", "Dial M For Murder", "Vertigo", and "To Catch A Thief", as well as this film) is one of my favorite periods in his career. In The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always. Doris Day is very believable in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blond. I thought there was nothing fake about her performance. Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive, "Yes, dear", pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm.<br /><br />There were some really clever lines written for Hank (the couple's son who later gets kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus- it's too bad Christopher Olsen read them so woodenly. It's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s, though. Most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent, though- most notably the assassin (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /><br />Some little touches that make this film undeniably Hitchcockian- the use of non-English dialog, especially French (something Hitch did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); the use of foreboding, Arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; Stewart and Day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the tune of the hymn; the Albert Hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, building up tension, as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect Hitch used at the end of "Spellbound", also).<br /><br />All in all, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a fun film to watch. It's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but all the same it is one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.	-3.3914471378994135	-3.1867331162445387	-2.61894384117271	-2.3824749961795777	-1.6332385892260812	-1.0799379784444652	-0.5434941002017328	-0.49298490622372837	-0.3427650966241622	0.05011474642186647	0.1145693201664632	0.15987490338307264	0.21295054425506357	0.21366313216092442	0.45021426057779884	0.7314079616701056	1.062665470464073	1.0915025204133162	1.195149945073128	1.2933663373084119	1.5508064040794305	1.9465366280679812	3.866511495403134	4.1185846836872	5.123354143687929	
Here's my first David Mamet directed film. Fitting, since it was his first, as well. <br /><br />The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con. It's like "The Grifters," but without that film's level of acting. (In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) The acting here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration, which they aren't. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.<br /><br />The dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be. I was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don't. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. He's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What's more strange is that other than this, the film doesn't look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. The best chunk is in the middle.<br /><br />It's standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. I'll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting she'd write a cheque? Was Billy in on it? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)<br /><br />And from here the cons are start to roll out. I found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. We're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is. <br /><br />We see the ending coming, and then we didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I didn't see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.<br /><br />I'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is. If you want Mamet, go watch "Glengarry Glen Ross" again -- James Foley did him better.<br /><br />***	-13.306821498786428	-7.129859859479803	-5.0666615962163455	-4.815726393838185	-4.776999050984033	-4.063499509212178	-3.223110583061718	-2.6935640136195373	-2.000844571442198	-1.8881189610469402	-0.8707789725554236	-0.29364925484667204	0.30432655774099243	0.7196766598712502	0.7595348747659567	1.1501043705263314	1.4647946190578558	1.9955018755411895	2.0298652715960275	2.318421693054423	2.516783960448939	2.685167880757292	3.948372300759707	6.747660247336575	14.708607235580201	
Horrible ending - and I can't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks. This was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours were action packed, though absurd in the premise, and then it deteriorated into a slow, painful, sophomoric dissolution of the series. Unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was. Were we to think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism, I would reread Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. Absurd to think 38K people would give up everything for a "fresh start". Absurd to throw in a disappearing Kara, and a reappearing Baltar and Six. Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve. Just absurd.	-5.273107340431327	-2.272550354812794	-2.1996962979454473	-1.9890685480597672	-1.6149286368705358	-1.5257771158427351	-0.6593692353836298	-0.5978730952250727	-0.4301056806830534	-0.3890450317192733	-0.35766990089912976	-0.03338419954151271	0.09960681106128592	0.1753742257383711	0.19793516426647773	0.20478846748324847	0.41484583023330185	0.42760797457205824	0.5200945724862657	0.5782295787373737	0.7627463971421096	0.8645535650970118	2.037492427800454	2.738408071331854	5.479827309044252	
Horrible acting, horrible cast and cheap props. Would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie. What a waste. Starting from the name of the movie.<br /><br />"The Enemy" Naming it "Action Movie" would've made it better. (contributing to the parody effect). The cop looking like a 60 Year old player, the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times. Towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie. Horrible. Don't waste your time.	-5.237760981700837	-2.8156242995867515	-2.7088701298687656	-2.5960189213385707	-2.5735423098943793	-1.2656971900986635	-0.7221714587882727	-0.7157733019423277	-0.5592216958433417	-0.55037004862422	-0.5098486413940952	-0.5037495964610018	-0.4401526313269899	-0.3894628484670799	-0.2587809035886908	-0.12630302496907347	0.14219964728970008	0.2523207992656677	0.7499301540514767	0.7916510140032564	1.214102131403027	1.5270207254476542	1.643838113806332	3.1225357022044165	5.440101711036307	
This is one of the worst films ever. I like cheesy movies but this is simply awful. Where are the images in the film that are on the box? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire film. <br /><br />Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading? I feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I explore IMDb I should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and time back. <br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. <br /><br />Even if curiosity is motivating you, stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead. It will be much more enjoyable.

Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I'd say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device, because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. And yet, the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez doesn't re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs. No more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights. The story opens inside Count de Lavud's final resting place, where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic. Naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart, and the vampire count comes to live again, immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work. The vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic, and it's up to Dr. Enrique Saldívar to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker. "The Vampire's Coffin" uses a limited amount of locations and there's very little action. The whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances. The photography is amazing, though, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is most notably during the scene in which Count de Lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night. It's the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film, the rest is fairly mediocre and déjà-vu.	-5.386645995999071	-3.334213077437063	-3.0028589766273903	-2.662034864430044	-2.329067543138554	-1.9962749600787686	-1.7478457642759404	-0.3968011909906344	0.08678207554054398	0.24639683953052488	0.25619184545831064	0.294358364715288	0.3373773668086681	0.36816442125305937	0.3791538374167445	0.5276260870773208	0.8030512938681897	0.8246472188284564	1.0719034411183126	1.2077330653254612	1.4469418021503304	1.5036143878194903	2.220342261664757	4.00713367452954	7.954002445957843	
I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.<br /><br />This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.	-2.8918332235326965	-1.9259494657005651	-1.6271522005270207	-1.5341253908834782	-1.4814270982880748	-1.223816603770466	-0.9215034797741043	-0.5455000128200135	-0.5252381563400985	-0.4723869701693887	-0.24603028580749406	-0.10123886016240682	-0.09780460601582489	0.19134354782320934	0.20864969993252047	0.2655771632527409	0.33092188150705015	0.33564603451916236	0.5652717702840435	0.5973673140194607	0.7208770320485818	0.8355703810172613	0.8883488744110697	2.334369132722729	3.655639624445318	
So keira knightly is in it...So automatically we compare this film to attonement. Aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.<br /><br />The Actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.<br /><br />If you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.<br /><br />This film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath. No its not exciting, but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters. At moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie. We expect a lot from movies as everything is possible, and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief.<br /><br />There are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster, if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not to judge them as actors but let them become people, you will truly ind yourself moved.<br /><br />GO ON!! give it a go!	-2.0218905929164053	-1.5880088966364834	-1.4932661082513	-1.3857184065926351	-0.6389943780800997	-0.40850989296617657	-0.39976144896323795	-0.2310656067150695	-0.1937010850841454	-0.1825046989297791	-0.1010179299206465	0.024970507805690045	0.04089210507892346	0.05530014664947333	0.21642261140760355	0.5415078919571807	0.5717094412568152	0.6271240203315146	0.8821194579359883	0.9693106278274353	1.061267024490684	1.074956837989181	1.5999784289979633	2.0874792675963785	2.749154475207178	
As one who frequently goes to the movies, I have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies I have seen this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters. It is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels. I wish Hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre.	-1.8590417660070673	-1.5038614044028873	-0.7887660837414028	-0.5427482210635514	-0.40655470950957406	-0.14878457400367992	-0.1440065366755328	0.006178000673703877	0.0248661960740649	0.10222227868644831	0.10673869515892481	0.11583795111597076	0.18816094628239466	0.2492580342090377	0.2767551263542899	0.3827135374886152	0.39348227047032475	0.4191514946524384	0.5404444465270176	0.5557644260111879	0.8101809281147911	0.8362592175057353	0.9547892447789389	1.1079481890753033	1.860684311780803	
This movie reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s- not like the recent "Failsafe", which seemed more of a stunt than anything else, but a TRUE moral drama that is both engaging and thought-provoking. Anne Heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment. I found myself waiting for THEIR affair to begin, if only because they look so good together. This movie is apparently based on a true story, and it's a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change. <br /><br />Directed by Christopher Menaul, who also did The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and the Prime Suspect series, this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing.	-2.4344059624146253	-1.1324682942575661	-0.9533902911405496	-0.8597585260046681	-0.6313872888373175	-0.2816512912581029	-0.13197089772067666	0.03537033616767271	0.06264985694262523	0.09456356748477013	0.26035350203940755	0.36226776047382414	0.39092202524660724	0.4386507089185282	0.476282327316341	0.5752173583855446	0.5918953455659715	0.7899675753055991	0.8978844034424746	0.9035246413460786	1.0417635560104204	1.2455604097751893	1.3643301436384763	1.5387635063891527	2.27708892828648	
Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film isn't too sticky and pink, because love is as a rose: With thorns, that is. The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth. <br /><br />The music and lyrics of the cabaret/chanson-esquire songs (sung b Keira Knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film, from one place to another, between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love. Some people may find it too much a biopic, but it ís mostly a romantic story, even though it consequently follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy. <br /><br />London gets visualized from another angle for once, the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombings of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. The independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. <br /><br />Maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film, but all in all this is a great romantic story.	-1.471877086988481	-1.4449911456071964	-1.3557359682946697	-0.981446823823817	-0.6725157845734716	-0.5826835492359317	-0.5196042667787476	-0.3658960289406988	-0.247349069190132	-0.13081479187668202	-0.09119280351262196	-0.041410088024500205	0.08493859941502618	0.12150100116846568	0.1263708061516336	0.2800152232647716	0.3902631012295763	0.5524055262856408	0.595027600803059	0.74573267817519	0.8296536431795866	0.936146615442805	1.3016410542196615	2.057818718360835	3.177050446609017	
...this would have been what you got.<br /><br />Words alone cannot describe how bad this is. If you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and I guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s-- but he's phoning it in here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape.<br /><br />Driving a Batmobile that looks like it rolled off Honest Al's Used Car lot at below sticker price-- the Dynamic Duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car they're driving-- in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial.<br /><br />The acting is wooden-- the sets are cheap-- the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following I'm sure it read along the lines of "Batman says something here" because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along.<br /><br />Batman's Utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets-- in one scene when Batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts-- never to be seen again. His cowl is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike.<br /><br />In one scene (I am not making this up), Batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods. It's radioactive so he can trace it-- the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained. Well, unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground. Thanks Batman!<br /><br />In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled, Batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if Batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds. Not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to Gotham City.<br /><br />There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale who is convinced Bruce Wayne is Batman-- she must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside of Bruce's house-- or maybe she saw Batman and Robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood.<br /><br />Everything about this serial is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen. IF you're looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark-- if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman films, the Adam West Batman TV Series or the earlier Lewis Wilson Batman serial.	-11.320319286109438	-5.544051267429684	-5.328004572612646	-4.798119412093014	-4.690274365128532	-2.8769037714300114	-1.6050814892128713	-1.2669049430574761	-1.0223524195227673	-0.7901960945542723	-0.7126621785259921	-0.6949068488193612	-0.554103495581916	0.17464513460492342	0.3571610002112538	0.44135077973262915	0.7750432334741834	1.2434898070441107	1.2512229785479276	1.544387489032089	1.6749468868023223	1.9226625874913301	4.301590684874996	5.875258008732134	11.56016075016019	
A beautiful shopgirl in London is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in British Ceylon. Although based upon the book by Robert Standish, this initial set-up is highly reminiscent of Hitchock's "Rebecca", with leading lady Elizabeth Taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and (almost immediately) her own husband, who is still under the thumb of his deceased-but-dominant father. Taylor, a last-minute substitute for an ailing Vivien Leigh, looks creamy-smooth in her high fashion wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; however, once husband Peter Finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her, one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic (this feeling hampers the ending as well). Still, the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs: romantic drama, a bit of travelogue, interpretive dance, an elephant stampede, and a perfectly-timed outbreak of cholera! *** from ****	-1.029198612700208	-0.7643073376905994	-0.514084609361633	-0.48567286715220775	-0.4411690178130501	-0.33078811889580007	-0.2623507249409837	-0.24867197110778605	-0.19259657290172355	-0.1606461649535762	-0.08114132464354296	-0.04128497647992588	-0.011681647678631175	0.13625758648743275	0.14505270987605334	0.16551281667628068	0.23603697492466788	0.23805517069120086	0.35399154430474267	0.3803835327833057	0.4721635494896641	0.7430807031895856	1.1796695244121511	1.17999789777367	2.06086829661591	
I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed couldn't save this sequel. I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original. Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene (notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs); and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious. I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang, having lost their "wheels" due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie. Being shamed by that putz character Carrington, I'd hate to see what they would resort to later: maybe Mopeds?<br /><br />I also never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky-Australian-boy-can't-fit-into-Outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look. It was Disney story gone horribly awry.<br /><br />So, it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubble-gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it.	-5.734985671271588	-2.3672916657372416	-2.26958284407076	-2.2158083858305635	-2.16333089696814	-1.7094878743026203	-0.9186136075409541	-0.6029510083266085	-0.5100570392796513	-0.4363222999877689	-0.34719467555349637	-0.15562950303578188	-0.03910745395804964	0.08428771341469216	0.2801832835594796	0.4815823734198924	0.482848442807934	0.5127377224666365	0.5227873468044405	0.541212398272209	0.6481988966104796	0.7613990531559022	2.1469160981651303	2.864228517997036	5.927207469657684	
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. One late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery. There are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. Its not a bad film, its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. Normally I'm forgiving, but this time out I just couldn't go with the flow (Then again the copy I saw was absolutely horrible). Worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong)	-4.019866561824297	-2.1220917936003905	-1.4845260748031999	-1.3997575462074365	-1.388563507121076	-1.2793341740453097	-1.148551449222155	-0.7584060356457119	-0.36472566851958155	-0.2190725735226515	-0.0695043322508962	-0.05647067219022388	0.15934131607798402	0.1715632977278081	0.23385761485189538	0.44468360812136204	0.5139327699821082	0.5881751977845829	0.7315599614997087	0.8622219252356984	0.8885286017597556	1.085187962582518	1.3865184002426678	1.8998192572946704	4.3346801197961335	
Who likes awful "comedy" shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are: One, Muslims and self-proclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). Two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.<br /><br />CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. I'd be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it's actually Muslims, or hip, funny young people? No, I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960's.<br /><br />When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are, Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for "comedy" Little Mosque on the Prairie. It is supposed to be offencive and funny? Only the CBC would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching.	-6.834022427532137	-3.1178315447469673	-2.7684075589087582	-2.754666962171478	-2.6113706859630095	-1.878431972755179	-1.0027840864714557	-0.7086152410942496	-0.6048872946570166	-0.45877793742095446	-0.40091346479240453	-0.36965222927085	-0.24065358342717508	-0.11771738909140106	0.21715783343661801	0.23712538405209943	0.5048783376064321	0.5480397351295839	0.5593926073053941	0.6305893591839796	0.917838501670946	0.9619565759793096	2.7438129431731877	3.2925380787469494	6.845632437712973	
The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script. The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja. All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to India. When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhar's family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. Here starts the intense struggle which can be called "Nandini vs. Narasimha".<br /><br />India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct. The portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. One thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful. The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.<br /><br />The film's biggest strength is the performances. Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini. Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance. One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha. He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. He is outstanding. Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India's most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief. Anyway, do watch Shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.	-9.806127402098225	-6.348627423097259	-4.787906761454675	-3.471701025122379	-2.5957082523459976	-1.0138790081562883	-0.31136325697055917	0.03809573942941717	0.3645224192757979	0.9663041673243168	1.4740216989303803	1.6078849940803304	1.7816733602958426	2.172519355672928	2.3416183938511397	2.8094091067291016	3.1788945113671216	3.74729054731474	3.9006379502221624	4.474382340258708	4.478942740539683	4.983182305012267	7.2214747160118415	8.847658330990603	10.803044629224525	
I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick "Snuff". I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one, so my interest was peaked.<br /><br />Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story, no character development. Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways like beating her, spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a mallet, burning and putting maggots on the burns, throwing guts at her, and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.<br /><br />I must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes. But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought "Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie". I did enjoy the flick but I don't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10	-6.4654570948206755	-2.632965249636824	-2.5769432211441132	-2.5512273375088452	-2.5233769415309117	-2.3652532028996087	-2.2651289167906823	-0.7022735976495813	-0.5484814208980161	-0.3210425088918943	-0.29961781445412106	-0.08980985108444464	0.2149897789455489	0.29304443818770665	0.35250126518704034	0.35745991660689713	0.4032429726874935	0.44959825468368786	0.4850767456592035	0.7882067115523957	0.9493994816659793	0.9659228355769703	2.42326868964387	3.3365707682423156	7.287794070603351	
In this "critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host, becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette). When troubling questions arise about this boy's (story), however, Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret" according to film's official synopsis.<br /><br />You really should STOP reading these comments, and watch the film NOW...<br /><br />The "How did he lose his leg?" ending, with Ms. Collette planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to "deleted scenes" land. It's overkill. The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York. Possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the "highway" or "video tape" scenes. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a "director's cut"? <br /><br />Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) don't seem, initially, believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a "gay impersonation". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect.<br /><br />Best of all, Collette's "Donna" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be, "you know, like that guy from 'Psycho'." There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some award consideration. She is that good. And, director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.<br /><br />Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin, and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.<br /><br />******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin	-5.4072058720311595	-3.918001708158638	-3.106321739504376	-2.7140289927903645	-2.246586925049688	-1.8528331017585145	-1.3513966126983517	-0.9605718959696522	-0.6292803448558888	-0.23062231233446953	-0.1184761845609349	-0.10722978619262696	0.024057750043272347	0.04270614264568642	0.2218928109093718	0.22787213068377873	1.0666733618125552	1.0786696896065964	1.0939017536618818	1.150785327487812	1.3063955156424436	1.9576786447647978	2.559145744003738	4.046591553888487	7.168121007129127	
This sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5-reeler is definitely not among Harold Lloyd's better films. Gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. Saccharine melodrama is abundant. The setup takes forever, as Lloyd, the unconventional, but impossibly kindly, country doctor makes his rounds, bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly, and puppies. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh. 4/10.	-2.2486937208502367	-1.076061451534145	-1.0717131903262693	-0.6014763867112484	-0.5903523436025289	-0.5085697466676549	-0.41351346872851014	-0.2974671719396532	-0.22635566764963588	-0.20519123434588685	-0.2016891569592532	-0.14426173005922716	-0.08338155506876631	0.0733939706674992	0.09595334784480784	0.16278924773315318	0.23432827812324009	0.2718122907284206	0.2768542202248975	0.3663296585607052	0.3918545293678898	0.4636904352272891	0.6528436492933172	1.0036167587814437	2.105537528075037	
I'm not entirely sure Rob Schmidt qualifies as a "Master" in the genre of horror, since he previously just directed one horror film called "Wrong Turn" and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre, but fact is that he made with "Right to Die" one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the "Masters of Horror" franchise. There was a similar underdog story in season one, when William Malone made on of the best episodes with "The Fair Haired Child" even though his other long feature films "Fear Dot Com" and "House on Haunted Hill" sucked pretty badly.<br /><br />The story of "Right to Die" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery, the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney (Corbin Bernsen of "The Dentist") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, Abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff. Meanwhile Abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. After a few victims, Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. "Right to Die" is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TV-series concept like "Masters of Horror". It's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard. Great "MoH" episode; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons.	-5.281298645959257	-2.845497939076465	-2.719825326321583	-2.3729751427435133	-2.1780966961891672	-1.3478721748383182	-0.90302235516663	-0.7053958185383072	-0.48271796697294855	-0.3846718599342451	-0.16337996487420303	-0.1375900168468944	-0.12307422448542055	0.031761704420248345	0.0607460202173277	0.2683442896732063	0.5122177960964855	0.7393234954838471	0.8162419425874134	0.9893501274505729	1.2329286181034032	1.6913641424649635	1.9859877425404098	3.7138775949902576	6.917506485779595	
I saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the London film Festival. Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and the slacker mood of Kevin Smith's Clerks. Four stories intersect at a French motorway diner. The first vignette has Franck (Edouard Baer) bungling a hold up at the diner. The waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) takes pity and tell him her story. The second has two incompetent kidnappers, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenage girl from her rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family don't appear to want her back. The third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner (Alain Bashung and Arno playing themselves). The final part is about four ex-criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into  the diner. An 'epilogue' returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, more a conclusion).<br /><br />The structure does not really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in Pulp Fiction. Nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of the individual stories varies. The hideout story is a cute idea, with a couple of good gags, but does not come off; and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull. On the other hand, the kidnap story is hilarious, although its connection to the diner is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is the Franck and Suzie one.<br /><br />This film isn't entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing more of Writer/director's Samuel Benchetrit's work.	-3.9146993924294393	-2.987242649603725	-2.6499262011189786	-2.242307231213048	-1.7871695911272214	-1.0290448896539992	-0.8836161029097124	-0.6098377089936511	-0.5379319227370564	-0.3797261825623584	-0.17289380862803694	-0.13070229089383253	-0.07685158695734881	0.014883748605490243	0.18929070660484285	0.4753913388576762	0.5461039788371236	0.7991546222952522	0.9116847983957761	1.0595932303526807	1.288885312598703	1.8148482562653556	2.338250033746911	2.923232215873177	5.899630871828236	
For the record, I am a Curly fan through and through. But I do have to say that in reality, Shemp wasn't really that bad. Yeah, he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that Curly had, but in his own way he was hilarious. At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser.<br /><br />In BRIDELESS GROOM, Shemp plays a music professor (Stooge? A professor? Yeah right), who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle, and Moe & Larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock that night, or no money.<br /><br />This was one of the Stooges' first skit with Shemp, before they started recycling their material. Perhaps it isn't surprising that Shemp was part of the Stooges before Curly came into the picture, so he seemed natural at this. The slapstick gags are hilarious, especially this one scene with Moe and Shemp in a phone booth. Essential Stooge short to be honest.	-3.9422505695974093	-1.9309605286153035	-1.5271845034006888	-1.2636393311085008	-1.1824656585768514	-1.1315262392550787	-0.9475755405255052	-0.3211523252396933	-0.20660647120088943	-0.20463752110026395	-0.1618887132762486	0.1378690831344719	0.17668992227316954	0.23897425679630677	0.2544526840305047	0.3771624185959607	0.41035607748608965	0.45300355813355087	0.6764806606034032	0.7530863603248188	0.8611568549040723	0.9723631872716598	1.220880529581008	2.044261017913735	4.655965650760829	
This film is a study piece for my english class, but it's depth and meaning has amazed me. Since we're looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film, its and interesting tale of love, hate, war, and prejudice. Well Recommended!<br /><br />Story: A girl named well-off jewish Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens, and as they get to know each other, they begin to see the others qualities, and they earn each others love. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (the prisoner of war) almost blows his cover to protect her, but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone.	-1.239897133252468	-0.8580263991481828	-0.7014496740455792	-0.4521136799034689	-0.4435946343381858	-0.419112180583639	-0.3544906671135581	-0.3290457242049139	-0.2661457390814679	-0.25630273199398856	-0.18757358907802543	-0.1606017942114625	-0.10456054549711755	-0.06520964945382958	-0.054284873538512066	0.06895258699299205	0.09463270064278251	0.243992647549911	0.24600383085548883	0.2843526821374926	0.30051588782360783	0.3688529029037282	0.6431733735188437	0.9005367392438675	1.1922445070649426	
The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. The odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. Supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor--the secret of their success, you might say. But Galaxina is quite uniquely different--it is MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional *and* the unintentional humor alike fall flat.<br /><br />It is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail--and the reasons are quite varied. Sometimes it's a timing question; sometimes it's a good idea badly worked out (the human restaurant *could* have been hilarious, but it wasn't); sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room, with the punchline ending up on the floor; and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes. Bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus. It's harder to figure out why Galaxina doesn't get any laughs on that count. Something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie, just as something is wrong (not at all subtly) with the intentional humor. It is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is. It's absolutely unique in my experience.	-6.2391627976867925	-3.7930019656371896	-3.658019968750006	-3.4797339510155254	-3.015502837542292	-1.6795195922866661	-1.274051561064504	-1.1597388030973215	-0.7182097282263269	-0.6324523362741166	-0.5767011506373788	-0.1941681068157421	0.09100411551526011	0.3555980854636951	0.41006700505825877	0.4116567478501434	0.5988276017434857	0.8235264816739822	0.8419980785506198	0.9531429873386642	1.048515078417227	1.620157786606833	2.184568620984616	4.36242951658572	7.252339947975898	
I haven't seen this movie in 30 years so I don't know if I would like it as much as I did when I was 12. At the time, however, I loved this movie. This is a great "starter chick-flick" for young pre-teen girls. Be careful of the ending, though. There are tears and harsh emotions.<br /><br />Looking back at it from a 2008 perspective (with so much more knowledge of child psychology, politics and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to watch again. Patty's uncaring, abusive father, indifferent mother and favored sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for companionship. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was heartbroken when he was killed. The rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old.<br /><br />The thing that I most strongly retained is how this movie taught me even "enemy" soldiers are people too. Not all German soldiers were hateful Nazis. When I was older, I saw TV shows like Hogan's Heroes and The Rat Patrol which also made the point that the "regular" German soldiers were not the same as the Gestapo.<br /><br />"Regular" soldiers were drafted. The Gestapo were handpicked among volunteers for their special attitudes of hate. I believe that one of the privileges of being a Nazi was that they had special assignments and, therefore, didn't go into battle. Their specialties were interrogation and torture.<br /><br />Later, during the cold war, I would think about Russian soldiers and remember SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "evil". But the reality was that Russian soldiers weren't out to destroy America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life. Which, in a way, was true, since the US fought to end Communism.<br /><br />The lesson is still applicable today. German soldiers were not the same as Nazis just as Muslims are not the same as Al Qaeda.	-9.422270015123871	-4.6765224111307	-3.196019801506029	-2.6611410155573805	-2.653900649140029	-2.4466286441667635	-2.409841008000824	-2.2967410474201064	-1.142418976675581	-0.6258916117623659	-0.5078431932790687	0.047876803543503765	0.39928560167022253	0.5055729014780821	0.6634953703765918	0.7947335947655118	1.2917649593466	1.3254829217885338	1.577190281326779	1.8028505021245051	2.285380553732955	2.314005107024779	2.6066624386126893	4.763885558296585	10.215570458958876	
I was disappointed with the third film in the "Death Wish" series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into Bronson. He is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on T.V. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the A-Team and I like the escapism fun of a show like the A-Team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated. The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. The plot is something out of an episode of "Highway to Heaven" and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and go on to the 4th installment which I highly recommend.	-2.8485856453860774	-1.6183685035023236	-1.5766523766816212	-1.5585364956444314	-1.5009926042520085	-0.8048879826166474	-0.45780090542702917	-0.3708966704954748	-0.30551477761352874	-0.30060240106059877	-0.26709830464481055	-0.20203691898975293	-0.16051736293725835	-0.11053899153822093	-0.06928147606032702	-0.05834318013780218	-0.045428222277417024	0.3516678350498907	0.5185968462952196	0.586267257531525	0.6970907981755209	0.7860784936413047	0.9566012840967857	2.0580472227470628	3.1734007032534723	
I just watched this today on TV. It was on ABC's Sunday Afternoon Movie.<br /><br />This wasn't a very good movie, but for a low budget independent film like this, it was okay. There is some suspense in it, but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down. The script is pretty lame, and the plot elements aren't very realistic, such as the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder. I don't know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea, but it isn't very realistic.<br /><br />I thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller, because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good, but unfortunately, they never did. There were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this, and in the end, didn't prove to be very creative.<br /><br />If there is something good about this movie, it is the cast. Every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy, and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good, watch the excellent animated movie The Incredibles. In that movie, she put her sexy voice to good use.<br /><br />What can I say, this movie isn't really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they were all wasted on this movie, which is a real shame. This movie tried to be a good suspense thriller, but in the end, it fell flat. If you want to see a good movie that is similar to this, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie, watch any of their other movies. You can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it.	-3.741612488023877	-3.5901053600834985	-3.4711463683953507	-3.286347677047842	-2.050601278984911	-2.0095627178057134	-1.746841898730584	-1.2304946458587844	-0.6319191789383971	-0.6286660004043519	-0.5875129715914893	-0.3828415268342822	0.08959148093166569	0.3570764032269558	0.5437857573520078	0.5475179291454209	0.7867155505034923	0.7916217943573962	1.5952332042329433	2.058979760179385	2.1245845833189123	2.5425797254359876	2.8336511239481443	4.272946443603139	6.874959097824671	
I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It has been one of my favorites since... It's so perfect in all it's glory complete with awesome soundtrack, cheesy dialog, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. The first movie I really just had a fit about at the end... I won't ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker... I just remember feeling SO sad for Gary! What a bunch of cool characters in this movie it's genius!!! They are all so great even the nerdy girl Gary doesn't like...(she had a nice little body though). I can't believe all the girls go for Rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck!!! ha ha ha... When watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases(almost). But a love story at heart with real problems, dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast. I love this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl another all time classic you will too!	-2.5635332863529623	-1.439408933229998	-1.2457160378157786	-1.1335721023138206	-0.9718231431472326	-0.6510907217938287	-0.49211841649771126	-0.4391276335847691	-0.42414960114841427	-0.3180024295768141	-0.15697531741294596	-0.09522718539794181	0.0071899513772929885	0.1047644877053204	0.1819499259190318	0.20196456494306486	0.32716480824536803	0.3314097334681427	0.6199944367504114	0.6904788900780395	0.9726368813750615	1.0866834782073642	2.004336840610349	2.1970794855292213	3.177865092826642	
When naïve young Eddie Hatch, a window dresser at Savory's Department Store, falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he bargained for. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. The purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in a thankless role. Eddie's not just naive, but dithering and hapless. Gardner is gorgeous, but the only things that give the movie any life are Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving but jealous girl friend, Tom Conway as the suave owner of Savory's and Eve Arden as Savory's long time, wise cracking secretary. It's a role Arden could play in her sleep, and she's good at it. <br /><br />The musical opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Martin a big-time star. The only point of a musical, however, is to have music. Since One Touch of Venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts, Kurt Weill, composing, and Ogden Nash writing the lyrics, came up with a series of stylish, witty songs and one masterpiece. Without the satire, or the clever songs or Martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death. <br /><br />Not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the Weill/Nash songs, they brought in the movie's music director, Ann Ronell, to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived, turning sharp observation into lovey-dovey romance. Ronell was no hack; she wrote Willow Weep for Me. Wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked Ogden Nash's clever work. <br /><br />The one bright spot in the movie is that Weill/Nash masterpiece. "Speak Low" is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote. It's given one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments by Eileen Wilson dubbing Gardner. Dick Haymes contributes a chorus. <br /><br />As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a major music director, as well as composer and lyric writer. Yours for a Song: The Women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who would like to hear what little of the Weill/Nash score was recorded by the original Broadway cast, you might be able to track down the CD, One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast). The music is paired with Lute Song, another Broadway show that starred Martin.	-3.9174730227281147	-3.5510800703941623	-3.141889944223684	-2.9364776808942583	-2.6899266755934597	-1.4206385245966484	-1.1841382811521939	-0.8231289660153995	-0.5888611333161279	-0.20685695458618303	-0.16441125635587092	-0.08564455269089055	0.4242728196517116	0.8226231247163902	0.861754288558095	0.9508314401661313	0.9794263741099508	1.3813657847948426	1.4096584876981133	1.6834189989891835	2.302915623646462	2.3488778617058204	4.578250371113281	4.669341371876934	7.828839471631233	
Okay, I know this does'nt project India in a good light. But the overall theme of the movie is not India, it's Shakti. The power of a warlord, and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth. Then things go terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her father in law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of Karisma Kapoor. It is easy to get caught up in the love, violence and redemption of lives in this film, and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax.

The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie. He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad. <br /><br />Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /><br />Do not waste your time watching this film. Don't even bother downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice.<br /><br />And Justin, if you're reading this, stick to music. Even though you're no good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing.	-4.585633429166007	-2.639351264570863	-2.491302735302286	-2.34675362600082	-2.307833222994415	-0.9633032222733849	-0.6047510868689897	-0.5907651305208874	-0.49993869250545475	-0.43821554756690323	-0.32678437744920086	-0.22175972272379801	-0.10565653656799409	0.2210167902078231	0.2915854078076405	0.4001420217268688	0.4438307674592388	0.5035950440730348	0.5835436657773188	0.6717193161017551	0.7075403189615009	0.9351526316457213	1.3695700700176914	2.697790546439932	5.1009226531259735	
I posted on IMDb on this series recently, giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release. I wrote to that address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just received the following reply: <br /><br />From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /><br />Dear Kate, <br /><br />I work for the BBFC, the British equivalent to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country. Anyway, I am currently in the process of giving a certificate to the 1980 miniseries 'Oppenheimer.' While researching the work on the IMDb, I noticed your post and thought you might like to know that the work is about to be released (hence the need for a certificate). <br /><br />I don't know which company is distributing it, but keep your eyes peeled! <br /><br />Kind regards, <br /><br />Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /><br />hooray! <br /><br />I also want to contact Netflix re purchasing this. <br /><br />Kate Killebrew <br /><br />kk2840@earthlink.net I emailed the BBC recently regarding whether their terrific series Oppenheimer had ever been released on video or DVD. I have not been able to find it. I received the following reply. If you do write the BBC, be sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the US. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com, and find a box to check to request release by the owner (BBC) and be notified when it's released. <br /><br />Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net<br /><br />Here's the reply from the BBC:<br /><br />Dear Kate<br /><br />Thank you for your e-mail regarding 'Oppenheimer'.<br /><br />I was interested to read that you would like a copy of this programme which you have enjoyed. I have checked the BBC Shop and on-line retailers and can find no record of it being available. We are unaware of plans at present to release this programme on DVD. However, if you would like to make a suggestion, can I suggest you put it in writing to the commercial arm of the BBC:<br /><br />Commissioning Editor BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT<br /><br />May I thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBC.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Elaine Hunter BBC Information ______________________________________<br /><br />-----Original Message-----<br /><br />{Comments:} i am trying to find a copy of the terrific BBC production "Oppenheimer', a six part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from a book/script by Peter Prince.

Norman, Is That You? was (this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theater can't have been that great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. <br /><br />What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE: it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family. For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little "hollywood". Don't believe me? Check out lines about curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep.<br /><br />But... the movie really shines in a couple of areas. There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who's run away with his brother (!) to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is really memorable. <br /><br />But... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did his/their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed. And, it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I'm told. Still, it's vintage Madame, and shouldn't be missed. People are still stealing lines from Wayland; the man was truly gifted. Enjoy the movie!	-4.3513577460424235	-3.868749251626364	-2.6625007735385364	-1.9142136413523314	-1.3001346352685712	-1.057035565956264	-0.9806471177626289	-0.9351607142989437	-0.8801546491940341	-0.7796462086697136	-0.07203680962895626	-0.010244544732630964	0.06598121925080544	0.09477088361786518	0.1250147922934943	0.2398263361948206	0.38371895155888724	0.5328090068091499	1.307391494583324	1.4642367780382202	1.4914814003622336	1.8812942434552258	2.675096231548295	3.753275619637687	6.828026535823809	
Almost 30 years later I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably tender. Periodically, I check here at IMDb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a DVD. It's September of 2004, and I keep hoping -- deep sigh.<br /><br />One of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime-time evening soap; the other, Frances Lee McCain, was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced, as I recall it, on a short-lived PBS series which showcased original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playwrights.<br /><br />I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the era of VCRs, so I have no record of it, except in my mind's eye.<br /><br />12/31/2006 addition to above: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writer's own personal copy.	-3.445665603142451	-2.7957767820613793	-2.086532683801537	-2.0311402058595758	-1.2508246454129974	-1.1540304647997963	-0.9500931093256366	-0.773645102456045	-0.575556465433523	-0.11956258555766328	-0.012805492625658263	0.045596067246978	0.06953450021929408	0.21628094979041843	0.23732619963992413	0.294714307290528	0.42690834557415364	0.5039342539858106	0.7374339184710291	0.9583440881384667	1.3319981904265186	1.592204428001299	1.7872469128020558	3.5963763411400995	5.473096352105186	
How can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up? With enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop.<br /><br />You will never get your 90ish minutes back. Life is too precious to rent this movie.<br /><br />I feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.<br /><br />If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. He does have a very major part in it, so fans might enjoy seeing him. <br /><br />However, I believe most of his fans are young girls, who may be turned off by the violence in this movie.	-3.354698906423568	-1.708530977385987	-1.6387022295768658	-1.5699163793559086	-1.3098191021787697	-0.9528014015219285	-0.6953753924464817	-0.5897305903590594	-0.4342822646183074	-0.2262158176057063	-0.18824155498989587	-0.036234261295656496	-0.013557126326064872	0.04300542121267639	0.06660317388512554	0.16419039454744644	0.3504414901104953	0.4177689190662217	0.4784739221097738	0.48532132731871347	0.6413350953162588	0.7007407873878984	0.8745546637015122	1.5744782620374862	3.590687859236734	
I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.	-4.530036461413043	-3.0245376280348935	-2.1606889591214204	-1.5462653208393586	-0.9950453968310308	-0.20191154701534936	-0.19096738911790334	-0.1629851619540275	0.04647599413943978	0.13243207703718834	0.35816061114264536	0.6587130881681182	0.897602246147339	1.0056507831793677	1.0262082705639861	1.3990243944847147	1.4213763577263205	1.5204658159746267	1.9108941652319325	2.159101956436658	2.2566528410347715	2.8983024226433933	3.4782518099273783	4.303906628322412	4.761035516382302	
This movie just seemed to lack direction. The plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was. There was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering. The exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character's back stories (which were a little weak to begin with).<br /><br />All in all, I would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven't seen before. You're much better off just watching The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose.	-2.9842008796914454	-1.640988910471926	-1.592664123046883	-1.3578324938958766	-1.0900152246575452	-1.0051752185139498	-0.8840818080081247	-0.208694740863734	-0.20555774252808579	-0.19668967444269247	-0.07867036158704752	-0.028121835823644352	-0.02280272087757674	0.07847259103842594	0.10164743216738235	0.20367085295907966	0.24147370232571025	0.28046912448515243	0.6451078086948738	0.6586100281510653	0.6777384733657942	0.8325299801802939	1.0661824397894843	1.856208244124881	3.212964905286432	
Yes, The Southern Star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner Matt Monro. It pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature, stunningly miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond. Add in Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing an ostrich, tons of stock footage of wildlife, and poorly composed and dull photography by Raoul Coutard, and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of Senegal.	-1.7124838377716678	-0.9182271545420854	-0.8738310256777341	-0.8711613516353881	-0.8300179930293853	-0.4882976867494814	-0.47517782226736605	-0.42084634999192316	-0.28187005698277195	-0.17452077122982315	-0.1111825968592189	-0.10239617623744984	0.0164372907074046	0.03031445197072491	0.1655812833741418	0.16932151125645917	0.17757267111298164	0.21998118922051463	0.23062099724285548	0.2359909001697224	0.394506159775469	0.4925364273801475	0.6246186336731361	1.2204287252435428	2.0751094154000134	
Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in THE MUMMY'S HAND, return for this very minor Universal Horror offering. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick "Babe," we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named "Stuff". But the results are nowhere near as charming, and the scare level is virtually nil.<br /><br />Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle. Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride. But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as "The Phantom" who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself.<br /><br />This "phantom" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness. It's always nice to see perky Moran, but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of Universal's instantly forgettable misfires.	-3.602161121348378	-1.7324652036374881	-1.5147250541689388	-1.4024182971485195	-1.3596526179800377	-1.0789294861759169	-0.6480512050386478	-0.3106988054886352	-0.25144665756471496	-0.20315435050026479	-0.1284808225823395	-0.06551492346432959	0.04337812645097291	0.2253553374139694	0.3510606008542214	0.43346734519156044	0.4604933929438728	0.48331345157684574	0.5244802095420582	0.5813073552789358	0.6306741615063425	0.6999050920722791	1.1003393753930344	2.23363929880003	4.025669644276462	
I`ve seen this movie twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in it`s unrated version which is soft-core porn at it`s best and the second time in a trimmed down (cut all the sex and most of the nudity out) version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way. The unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world (no pun intended). Unfortunately, in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out, as are all the other sex scenes. Rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc;) trying to act. We also get appearances by B-queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).	-2.2996907934566306	-1.5242891789400097	-1.0877578067343872	-1.0223175511849143	-0.9512139574206586	-0.43903827739114387	-0.35925045096228103	-0.3502739115988089	-0.31196763117115944	-0.29696322054885094	-0.2735007880115484	-0.20786767206771128	0.03063288505172143	0.10039149550140364	0.1678979406612923	0.17105818579735643	0.30022634041632323	0.31160379143037503	0.3220744241991801	0.5183772674453031	0.5544168348092923	0.6535344862578207	0.6739493533697332	1.4306590962717476	2.486250101290124	
Okay, I love this movie!!!!! I watched it over and over again. It is so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It is so suspense full you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it is.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped. It goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend, to her teacher who takes a liking to her, to her ex-boyfriend, all different stories, all suspects. But who did it?<br /><br />I love the acting, they have a lot of great talent in here. The suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb. If it comes on TV watch it. *** 1/2 stars 10/10	-2.5008266743598098	-2.165892270364658	-1.8183338898954162	-0.8972213118001905	-0.619291303787676	-0.2571922315698887	-0.07207983609661095	-0.04070173433766791	0.010859529692032327	0.027303180647647668	0.059239763012365075	0.23249758033201803	0.23953417365712681	0.4288835058577974	0.43151035885514666	0.450376946998116	0.5346927832594945	0.8682086411500586	0.8715697719193991	0.9089684722186602	1.1712456182242972	1.6436331402872755	2.0013893330822228	2.988003671722225	3.011753895765613	
There's so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (Inside the killer's mind), that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really, really great done. It´s made with super 8, black and white shots, 35 milimeters, color, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa, which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering, did he really ever existed? The movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced. The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death. Nowadays, some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character. The one we are witness of -the movie.<br /><br />For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside Aro´s mind, mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done. Nevertheless, the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions, we clearly never justify them. So, the first half is based upon recollecting information; later things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the movie such an incredible new force (even tough never got weak or boring).<br /><br />I don't mean -and don't want- to spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy.	-3.229814537234693	-2.6293026837914546	-2.001218869717311	-1.8763527090965466	-1.1215470940508223	-1.000134784247043	-0.925007512486416	-0.4133555325804098	-0.2843458548894586	-0.09250873453764016	-0.08335409851681289	-0.02815840952967924	0.06427857223610428	0.07458047699825233	0.0788118434963907	0.07881815076010942	0.3841367166904821	0.6056181512076851	1.1221195300952	1.254667736110523	1.2963492176540559	1.5961164119781805	2.049158707065714	3.0208541467612955	5.056708916879106	
This is a great film.<br /><br />I agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this. I had never heard of it or anyone in it (excpet Mike from Friends).<br /><br />But it is great! Eva, Lake and Paul give amazing performances. The humour is consistently dry and witty.<br /><br />Paul Rudd pretty much plays the mike character from Friends (which works great). The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic (I mean we are not talking 'Apocalypse Now' here) But the characters are likable, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, production and direction all work well.<br /><br />In all a great feel-good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets.<br /><br />Everyone has their own tastes but I really don't understand the one star reviews for this.	-4.025926785800402	-1.7030048083936569	-1.4914621821087322	-1.3290412112509802	-1.0231405083061813	-0.6322148192168549	-0.02774603874849798	0.13310933583187967	0.1955807923207971	0.23461260022011726	0.5489829364504653	0.6284932633605445	0.7405644679501981	0.7994796995029274	1.1297345113980668	1.2043927545813455	1.2719206831900787	1.2723196658953406	1.359641715676485	1.7218284368185368	1.8490190445974435	2.1582582782183324	2.5456673131157603	2.8510667059656796	3.963049976504586	
*some spoilers*<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms (acting, dated dialogue, unclear storyline) unfounded. Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque, menacing, swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so. He learns too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other, the result being hilarious and touchingly sad.<br /><br />The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte wasn't allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith), so he never got his wings. The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostel's grasp, a metaphor for both men's live: it's too late and you don't get a second chance. Like "It's a Wonderful life," this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.	-2.6495095964439423	-1.9485144414097106	-1.8093489431843668	-1.3010645557366316	-1.20371821677597	-0.7214339224916833	-0.6844635637535462	-0.3727873677286628	-0.2253918721604497	-0.07200980272796834	0.01730460214625146	0.032947215292526436	0.09800827766405121	0.12395435000418599	0.2519738324799194	0.424263745306905	0.5615536174579586	0.618878255558311	0.6411237103999168	0.7170454637399686	0.7453191697431664	1.0655585174493252	2.0079676069329926	2.3215219064208767	4.466028042961423	
MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS (1998) ½* <br /><br />Starring: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language and some violence) <br /><br />By Blake French: <br /><br />	Believe it or not, in the new John Warren comedy "MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS" there is one funny scene. It consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, it's all this film has to offer...enough said. <br /><br />This movie is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and badly written, but also just plain bad. Even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got. It is so familiar it just isn't funny. <br /><br />How many times does the same movie about sports have to be made? Last years we saw this same material in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver," and as bad as that film was, this is even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family oriented. "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a Sunday afternoon. It is too childish for adults. So who is this film for? Teenagers? Elderly? People who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?<br /><br />	The film, like many others like this, has one basic point it tries to make: teamwork conquers all. Yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove. Too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes. Where the silly announcers form their own "buddy comedy routine" muttering one liners to themselves like "They suck," "This kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass," "This guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost--maybe it was his mind," "Somebody needs a nap," and "ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play." Where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name. And where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny.<br /><br />	"Major League Back to the minors" is so bad; it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence. The good baseball team is on a comeback, they are about to win and--the power goes out. I was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion, but in reality, its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time. The movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny. There is another kind-of-funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer. The coach's answer: "You're too old, too slow, and too fat." The player's reaction is to die for. But that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time, and certainly is not worth a cent of your money. <br /><br />So here is another dreadful entrée into this genre of film, another that is doomed with its own script, which is failed before seen, and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again.<br /><br />	-15.414328601834479	-7.743349754512669	-6.972346769354719	-6.854310630216121	-6.424776338382567	-5.55351149086849	-4.7259215785223265	-1.078868925420946	-0.8348367287747837	-0.7960987589736119	-0.6397575180132153	-0.270101795740646	-0.0053325174105623985	0.24372316716145048	0.5256435370060942	0.7236685030570382	0.8802920168500691	0.9115980220671951	1.5973199808000615	2.500338144851789	2.5610180756308005	3.920709851778662	5.614156646130288	8.67058125422625	16.827361077680287	
. . . or type on a computer keyboard, they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of "10." After all, no elephants are shown being killed during the movie; it is not even implied that any are hurt. To the contrary, the master of ELEPHANT WALK, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms--no matter how menacing--without a permit from the government (and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability). Furthermore, the elements conspire--in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic--to leave the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People (as the natives dub them) to close the story. If you happen to see the current release EARTH, you'll detect the Elephant People are faring less well today.	-3.066873581349015	-1.2852235176239781	-1.2594334748586293	-1.0734360081833016	-1.070551920006477	-1.0044695510206065	-0.6511508463784323	-0.33185245228781013	-0.29648458290418533	-0.23472398873720762	-0.21231930677730212	-0.09669131763412803	0.09233204202208595	0.13980989684868794	0.2619230760658046	0.2657797818842618	0.28316235580366433	0.28583399962910405	0.3665343566635782	0.37709300926355904	0.4036585147120603	0.5526376627269161	1.4343830753033526	1.6099274989729633	3.3466539317447017	
Now, I flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash...<br /><br />I appreciate the fact it's a spoof, but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing, acting and dialogue. Seriously, this rated as one of the poorest movies I have seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one at that...<br /><br />Okay - a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we assume its a heart attack), the army then launch shells, rockets, bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away, and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez, those things have a range of no more than 30 metres! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling; the monster drops the kid, and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster??? come on! (4) the monster looks like it something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get reactions (along the lines of hand to mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general just runs away, time after time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn't listen (8) the acting is awful (9) did I mention the rubber suit monster???? (10) that god-awful music, non-stop!	-4.449393642199082	-2.186603303362286	-2.092846317507845	-2.022828008456928	-1.986056517886929	-0.711316840209656	-0.7028995840561367	-0.534391237145258	-0.4777572030683065	-0.32146937506904405	-0.20099557347812652	-0.19476076497578076	-0.16935660685461257	-0.07479013722410549	0.023370321460432317	0.16368530906642917	0.26156552285232193	0.26541658306787463	0.2891525650248954	0.3123223678072309	0.5245347299182164	0.564192209580299	1.6738727058921832	2.2408197243779555	4.247349724447759	
I checked this out for free at the library, and I still feel ripped off. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually in it, but only in five scenes totaling up to barely 5 minutes, and even those are fairly painful to watch. The rest of the movie is so bad that you'll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you're one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it. Everyone else will just turn it off. Don't worry, you aren't going to miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case) are essentially just parroting of other characters lines, like this dialog:<br /><br />Lisa (Bullock) - "Danny, please tell me what is going on."<br /><br />Danny - "I don't know." <br /><br />Lisa - "Whaddaya mean you don't know?" <br /><br />Danny - "I don't know - it's something to do with my Dad." <br /><br />Lisa - "Whaddaya mean your Dad?" <br /><br />Danny - "I don't know - he ****ed up or something." <br /><br />Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /><br />Danny - "I'm sorry Lisa. I don't know." <br /><br />(moments later) Danny - "Some army buddies of my Dad . . . " <br /><br />Lisa - "Whaddaya mean army buddies?"<br /><br />See what I mean? <br /><br />Bottom line - Just say no.	-7.90800103559187	-3.5158479254793495	-3.275748283136123	-2.808452389606368	-1.7776223278178929	-1.731004154970483	-1.7126525683048133	-1.4753553936127546	-1.3362261818511336	-1.2926542044523024	-1.1357848952645955	-0.31724204483955615	-0.1032196941401364	0.02683424927857779	0.5997104172748261	0.6757864495954783	0.7663867534452007	0.9442836361447742	0.9514812177814995	1.2129774542666203	1.255746932297955	1.4961794537066126	3.182817069518241	3.4092928614820113	7.687343642120859	
Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal. One decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. And a one-note plot.<br /><br />The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law's character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film's banality.<br /><br />With a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography -- Crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.	-1.406505519982205	-1.110577668540763	-0.6954026454679556	-0.6332573646791975	-0.41416774076331386	-0.38717098781105574	-0.31509813428977224	-0.08261800226116077	-0.07071936288975961	-0.023382325813545816	-0.015174923752242206	0.10781956055528094	0.11150643797771743	0.1779660455677686	0.2367098790855126	0.24843446074897393	0.2665130331502956	0.35732835409511826	0.3674716795164054	0.5182036456151062	0.5226615084724969	0.8542788187997334	1.0061583061413282	1.2796792741577514	2.698853813717852	
Do not expect a classic military comedy, which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook. Instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine. Kind of East German version of "Buffalo Soldiers".<br /><br />"NVA" works on a meta-level that it sympathizes with its heroes' attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can. It's not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles. Utopian, of course (in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality), but very thoughtful.<br /><br />Just to fill the required 10 lines: Do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job.	-2.010076485636315	-1.4023355223007559	-0.6681626636517148	-0.63540366303934	-0.4518161358528947	-0.4333795237419062	-0.37234377499866395	-0.35250807725952604	-0.35008585505539225	-0.33378583240435244	-0.28286182575020047	-0.16621057139797313	-0.0015515462060658736	0.011883458397753066	0.094697307863182	0.22436140069820604	0.29282363269268685	0.372533578360949	0.446566163551655	0.4867204614140009	0.5519514508867216	0.6103944486292021	0.6295939786389482	1.1687466261954862	2.2236584126796104	
Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to get distribution in the West outside film festivals. Why? Could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk (and the victims enjoy it) or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull? These are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story. It makes Clockwork Orange which was banned for years in the UK look like a Disney cartoon.<br /><br />Should you see this film? YES It is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters. If you like this make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar (barring the insane ending in DOA of course). Great for Japan that they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD. If I haven't put you off try hunting for a Hong Kong version on the web as I'm sure it will come out in that country.	-2.3164904866450535	-1.7610952670766888	-1.5927729757709024	-0.8294151228205928	-0.8069440127053168	-0.6683308589478817	-0.4514658106582937	-0.28193287403140854	-0.1408318348997577	-0.125136133122713	-0.014354629397193439	-0.0018651357796658774	0.02133033984939327	0.34427651067722037	0.40865496548441593	0.4478563791785839	0.4557607163755519	0.520666407871617	0.5891633791540869	0.6531657715080926	0.6936536219593662	1.0080205237034954	1.6978181151122211	1.9013612560998454	4.226417431072541	
I don't want to go too far into detail, because I can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film, but I had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie. The animation is crud and the story alternates between boring/pointless to extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy, and the humor just did not work after being translated. It was a total chore to watch this movie, and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything - I wasn't expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel, but I was expecting something entertaining, and it simply didn't achieve this. Yaaawwnnn... Rent Kino's Journey instead.	-3.053071094254863	-1.9469975980058083	-1.657920312603311	-1.5855283932337343	-1.4222612096621994	-0.7082443857979187	-0.6827015475266304	-0.6813489638020029	-0.6505731792301105	-0.6319186004520894	-0.6318108357077485	-0.5010409516794953	-0.44356581086406466	-0.20548040551173308	0.10381235952253923	0.289486235446299	0.3799747731002888	0.46065228232238403	0.6148154376276513	0.6426467702717678	0.8487754469345299	0.9612406528020281	1.2473634415512858	1.9981238052100998	3.2104424834576206	
"The Thief of Bagdad" is impressive in the shape of the evil magician Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). He plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young King Ahmad, and a gorgeous princess from her father...<br /><br />He falls victim in the end, as all tyrants do (in books and legends) to love and of the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by the little thief (Sabu).<br /><br />The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms...<br /><br />The script is poetic, simply and very beautiful... The costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror...<br /><br />The radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues...<br /><br />For spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before...<br /><br />With flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genie (excellently played by Rex Ingram), with evil wizards, and with the good acting of Sabu and Veidt, "The Thief of Bagdad" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian Nights... <br /><br />The 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale!	-0.7374105876388917	-0.5352178823635424	-0.5158309773346401	-0.27924511838509725	-0.25525305075556487	-0.19925670104312615	-0.17524692128318906	-0.16005850989958073	-0.11321263125264668	-0.10300544089594353	-0.0643301119718882	0.00632918027658784	0.011478599974191202	0.028940417580760977	0.0847708816771841	0.16649096660517995	0.18276487965549076	0.21827904849922308	0.41726108396248907	0.43077518172628826	0.4458774806680502	0.46667090387862886	0.7808513969040171	0.8892459153285256	1.0931682636625784	
Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story. This movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is that? In these times of "Heather has two Mommies" (or what ever, you fill in the blanks) it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. With the father's roles being prominent I was hoping this would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing to have it end. Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role. I would have loved to see each character develop over the years. I loved this movie, it is one I will defiantly watch every time it's on. Good story, good acting, and I hope this isn't a spoiler, but no obtrusive sex or bad language. Yes it touched my heart. Warning, get the Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it Television or. Movie's. Daniell if your listening, You Go Girl, give us more.	-3.522815105530403	-3.2419042953584207	-2.1509872070983116	-1.3173116478343911	-1.0808557377134087	-0.5163473612137693	0.051506058406990234	0.07448032193246296	0.14123140981622387	0.18708516970737785	0.230239254650408	0.3044873682133356	0.38352365718001336	0.430651483944495	0.7397155439318581	0.7435524102269806	0.8937015792848965	1.006705554037816	1.1065176346822847	1.1431953684772689	1.8050905587930701	2.3303553145428255	2.4518577741946133	3.5401618859810062	4.425452168026766	
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone`s home movie . Drama schools must be full of idiots ! , there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio . Hey I think I`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE EVER SEEN or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it THE GREATEST SEX EVER SEEN . Oh hold on I`m not married and I`ve never been on honeymoon ! Not to worry I`ll send in a video of someone elses wedding/honeymoon <br /><br />!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!<br /><br />You`d think with an opening like that SHARK HUNTER could only improve wouldn`t you ? As shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed , best written and best acted part of the film , alas it`s all downhill from here as the family go to sea ( In reality a fog shrouded swimming pool ) in a three foot yacht where mom and dad get eaten by a CGI fin and their son Spencer swears revenge against the fin . Cut forward to the present day and the French are using an underwater research base for oil exploration . Only thing is - And it`s so obvious you can`t fail to notice this - it`s not filmed underwater !!! , the director hasn`t made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank . The underwater research base is blown up by the shark ( Maybe it`s hired by Greenpeace ? ) killing everyone inside and Spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of Frenchmen . What else happens ? No idea because I decided to watch something else <br /><br />No hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and I do hope Matt Codd becomes a big fish in Hollywood . You think you know about sharks Matt ? You ain`t seen nothing yet	-7.559613133354212	-2.766982247235215	-2.7313974957004583	-2.6486160657454727	-1.7706321209492173	-1.7585580709447972	-1.5192927220219832	-1.3201569115940686	-1.2638473794210547	-0.770375740091269	-0.5450182679027025	0.004060203295782314	0.18505915118400287	0.30452268350922485	0.3476239227837853	0.3634255039094486	0.4352222984371506	0.7400165380811945	0.8386489408696866	1.0485109418778342	1.0911307879119785	1.4137152106657325	2.746540802627352	3.835367885099661	7.466482363888257	
I was enchanted by Niami's debut. I hope that we'll soon see more of his work. I was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief NYC run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as Desperately Seeking Susan and After Hours, but with a gentle European whimsey that made it fresh and fun. A strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. And I thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. Sandra Bernhard puts in her best performance since King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is hilarious, and Ling Bai touching. See it.	-3.2187146937087183	-2.4609126656540212	-1.0435660089392598	-1.000514723028794	-0.6096300546264836	-0.3213669309212528	-0.28977528647763895	-0.2676304692651939	0.067310831056153	0.11530458259915709	0.23744372556997417	0.30640430608076247	0.3842001636092663	0.894163270089429	0.984003069263262	1.0862173299498914	1.103959877680087	1.1651307007033431	1.2511922137469833	1.4716394936624133	1.6594834426723282	2.052156096326897	2.1870780842943485	2.382132358364338	3.3681435412551304	
House of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part. A psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game.<br /><br />Have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong? Watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way. Sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators. You're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie.<br /><br />This is both a quality and a drawback of the script. As the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency. But all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best movies about gambling.	-2.4137179670033806	-2.4032788518975097	-1.2549375872420587	-1.2514543846386113	-0.8579950085104655	-0.16669534019717952	0.001118795204207601	0.01274317204273552	0.1981172635179323	0.19845395143661826	0.2170169869667279	0.26806947544881365	0.3724588050862273	0.42107293367526727	0.5245586435272461	0.5667146619196299	0.5878416919956351	0.6015350444996083	0.6449201031682031	0.742303368877044	0.8792121045409618	0.9870314244218572	1.6301071355459718	2.3931897226793706	2.8604280809978233	
God, I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot. I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just since "Titanic", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..). But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her "gal wit an attitude" schtick pretty soon. You can count me out of this one, Mr. Cameron!	-4.686669127500824	-2.4565390593587066	-1.8991568575958608	-1.611011794693891	-1.5007928731771554	-1.4974358408719068	-1.3007881236087657	-0.8147401889898491	-0.35973352335691106	-0.3285788265853837	-0.2875266196160031	-0.2049874292270687	-0.19851878586410718	-0.08102430408152755	-0.06675040335002472	-0.029819846736396004	0.032472628775806096	0.13527540177308844	0.20201031014874077	0.27868233304377915	0.5633787980179524	0.6414655873664163	2.0203286553334485	2.255050037153281	4.321201663360184	
That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days.<br /><br />First of all, there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie.<br /><br />I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder...<br /><br />Second, indie films are supposed to be about real people. There's nothing real in this film. None of the characters come across as being even remotely human.<br /><br />What they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how "cool and edgy" he is.<br /><br />Sorry, but this is not good writing, or good directing.<br /><br />What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance.

I have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the Stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, though the movie wasn't as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as Star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i don't remember one line from either of those movies, i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars T shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.<br /><br />though i didn't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects, were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today. I have to admit that I would never have gone into Sci fi if it wasn't for stargate, and my dad, who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6, and i'm glad he did, other wise i wouldn't have seen the brilliant shows like SG1, which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies, basically if a new sci fi series isn't better or as good as SG1, its not worth watching. basically this is the best sci fi show to date, and if you don't watch this, then you have no idea what you are missing!	-1.734427397780022	-1.2886872257519633	-1.1290285868732977	-1.0372853006741398	-0.6304197924186172	-0.6245975367865686	-0.48694915910926123	-0.2884057965151462	-0.22912560828300924	-0.13169764357336802	-0.1311845316743054	-0.03781523936649156	0.08091673209070291	0.09796971824796902	0.15541020941638528	0.17224228132397645	0.2515500397194716	0.25189757839643695	0.33387584155648076	0.4308200609748168	0.46010856798343885	0.48341080634311795	0.5129770015747088	1.463400399450205	2.218222576665079	
This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. Well there's nothing wrong with that, except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age. It's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves. The movie has no plot. It simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath. There are some funny scenes and comedic bits. But they don't redeem the flat monotony.<br /><br />The graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and not done very well at that. Anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation.<br /><br />I went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. Ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane, inane comedy. It works at times, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over. It's more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a hit-you-over-the-head-with-it kind of comedy. I can see where the story idea is intriguing. But, in this film post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England. In fact Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era. He plans to make a Part 2. I guess he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing.<br /><br />At the opening in LA, Wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2. He was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one, to which he replied, well yea, sure.	-6.385698771777731	-5.927739457183435	-3.7943755534189	-3.1792259923551107	-2.709908146696471	-1.7529966471571845	-1.573823246264112	-0.65692838286055	-0.3386407874403763	-0.1709674109924762	0.03225703978010895	0.040445895188728945	0.19511551268408886	0.204695785736275	0.32843882230971366	0.9698482109135166	1.0943219527472163	1.1169880045271066	1.290779193853071	1.420096334607829	1.5394376233986138	1.7304064986290626	3.7094509818855275	4.746782474222186	9.534584807024705	
Slashers.....well if you like horrors its definitely one to see, otherwise don't even bother.It is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, For instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere, and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow, trust me you wont need to look for them.Also try to ignore the cheesy actors, if thats what you call them!!The basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich. Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days,For example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game! especially for $12.000.000. so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind.	-1.032828008314631	-1.0074918253090008	-0.8983092779636875	-0.8196155139963704	-0.6984201776876229	-0.5188074905480881	-0.28688746149302846	-0.26569919039488255	-0.2575338675497065	-0.23719657498686725	-0.19325627915722438	-0.1825387902454678	-0.03319329444856967	0.0109696158966451	0.08916203484258954	0.18557991745719532	0.30111331925151913	0.3142607898702501	0.3414122478159689	0.36954440225496765	0.4827904325081278	0.5841120026789756	1.0337992409828554	1.188088908529181	1.4194264992946946	
Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a film for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers. As for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes. Where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional Hong Kong movie style with the Hollywood action adventure. Sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in Hollywood.	-0.9457793110291433	-0.9212065422612816	-0.5929754871536297	-0.4996843194699657	-0.38025450515542336	-0.28194131266420525	-0.17822081076029334	-0.15772245637384777	-0.15575995644352206	-0.10681833539399462	-0.0997437810909173	-0.06737866578802579	-0.047224752003064266	-0.01632175251760347	0.015280246890816127	0.024163550939216447	0.15024246164660648	0.31185649236570945	0.36347060136041504	0.4661609742920768	0.5045212436611477	0.5520361393832359	0.8517968926764732	0.9931825527935265	1.4668150914932652	
The pilot is extremely well done. It lays out how the characters bond in future episodes. I don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part. Although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode, a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot. An example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship. Even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /><br />A great start to an unbeatable comedy!	-2.7711940723402213	-2.2170362897755833	-1.2157816037426872	-1.0428344757963894	-0.8021103196140971	-0.01790129521143373	-0.0023431512578956093	0.018046218094881994	0.09423353246657146	0.1552702385882524	0.29495450106430043	0.30298015688254315	0.3034362723703702	0.4076639535932122	0.5350323856049306	0.5501217868587733	0.5599049798834994	0.7173273827036597	0.7758211330964475	0.782201609857323	0.8417477935593216	1.2371335562477541	1.9954074548398495	3.0486274853256647	3.0611567077703867	
We have to remember that the 50's were practically a blank slate when it came to movies. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies, noir, two reel oaters, etc to movies with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. Some folks might think that was an improvement. I don't. Who was the mogul who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy.<br /><br />This one is a pip. It's about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father's estate. One of them, maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay. He's initially in it for the bucks, but eventually falls for her. Meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance. The results are predictable. You get a little bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing. We never get to meet the parents, but they must really have been screwed up The cast is practically unknown. One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar. The acting is so bad it's hard to believe. It was released under the United Artists umbrella by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permits. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene.<br /><br />I can't explain it - not even to myself - but I gave this pile of trash an 8/10. I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad it's good", but I don't think I ever ran into the phenomenon before. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but this one certainly fits. You might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody's basement.	-12.400207547724973	-4.774942783302528	-4.071211055916548	-3.9859927707642724	-3.754184745512132	-3.204431568939062	-2.2896922016385473	-1.8905544909318823	-1.6616381954246757	-1.0057280875774524	-0.7646857261708992	-0.04097486116690481	0.28474091010506725	0.3836445376763394	0.9070774069122417	1.1337815370632685	1.1637822149016268	1.1858479115631362	1.3156252563210864	1.571879971394614	1.8976087087456948	2.1529921588418435	4.638476968566585	5.9411708251713256	12.435838684832609	
Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey work since The Truman Show, and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent "Hey Hollywood - look how good I can act!" box office disappointments. It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths. He won't get an Academy Award but the film itself will last longer than many of the "awarded films" of the Academy. He is at the top of his form in this most recent film - it's like the return of an old friend.<br /><br />Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, superb comic timing, and obviously having fun together but without the "hey mom - look how funny I am" type of comedy. A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrey's nemesis (Carrell of The Daily Show fame), who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film. I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the past three years.<br /><br />I can foresee the religious nuts in the US will be up-in-arms over the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will. Without Married With Children t o complain about, this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities (who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on Sunday morning and late nigh television, selling prayers to God). And, again, about 0.5% of the country will care and 80% of the media will report it.<br /><br />The bottom line: this a purely entertaining film, each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do, and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion. A walk down any major street in America has to confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor. What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry.<br /><br />Thanks again, Jim -- it's GREAT to have you back!!	-5.1824566173166495	-3.729830133330789	-3.0019603131233743	-2.022721192924455	-1.6769160135322987	-0.6653254829380976	-0.3341690708477809	-0.293078746221547	0.0639013845181579	0.4223907203047156	0.5071268901750985	0.9095433856144964	0.9301903329607359	0.9750189697154196	1.1066101900604994	1.1764372229466362	1.3554582600463108	1.9409924653518196	2.181946350954076	2.4260613861148745	2.4597127720637664	2.4787426412590423	4.6932435314501175	5.78474493115995	5.9416728489957595	
Aya! If you are looking for special effects that are 10-20 years before its time, this is it. The glowing lightning bolts, fireballs, etc. look like they came from a cheesy 70's sci-fi flick.

Another Aussie masterpiece, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well. It doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like American flicks, it focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. bring to life. It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside, and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10	-1.5266580057579253	-1.157902937815913	-0.9157816639942186	-0.5761734944810512	-0.4404830355274618	-0.2796956248568821	-0.2572021373779129	-0.20597641289310847	-0.17102771860296617	-0.11255190194322748	-0.08271610085025223	0.03167997354364397	0.23346916149208102	0.27704487751128454	0.2941271029105676	0.348956384946902	0.37090754535125503	0.5036308247842097	0.5184574698190421	0.8156789270186892	1.4252957378957227	1.4587312671354857	1.5958814692172754	1.670089368353743	1.882959184816775	
Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie had been set in the 60's ;like the book was. And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption..... I'm glad that, maybe, someone might be influenced to read the books..... but, The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT? And what's up with the volcanic upheaval? Where was THAT in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us!!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was European version of this film. I sure wish I could id it. I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption. This movie needs to be X'd.	-4.625986438223455	-2.886775554854889	-1.7266952905515658	-1.6413669910319535	-1.179159024829084	-1.1499072944580557	-0.8083478791904161	-0.5506631782302064	-0.5141857410557218	-0.4501479779705141	-0.07538856680666241	0.09873189198433285	0.13517991368817744	0.15949546212474416	0.20109491559611745	0.21887014676891564	0.24902264445399813	0.4578418552513357	0.49870508684209386	0.5534500619164463	0.6071148556793913	0.6146139063882817	1.4672025622628704	2.840836776498328	4.396483881472246	
It isn't TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.<br /><br />The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim... it's stupid.<br /><br />It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no "Look at me Kimmy!" jokes. The fat friend of Kim is not fat at all and she's not even slightly stupid. She's a stereotypical black/Latino chick.<br /><br />It's just not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It doesn't compare. Nothing is the same. I admit, this show is pretty funny at times, but it is NOT anything like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American take on a bogan family. They failed. It's supposed to be REALLY stupid and hilarious, but the actors don't act stupid! To me, this is just a typical American TV show. It's a let down if you want it to be anything like the Aussie show.<br /><br />2 Stars because it is an OKAY show, just nothing like what it should be.	-9.427694990592155	-3.87095809972506	-3.856864854126979	-3.4745425200577795	-3.1089501887043656	-2.649777106660758	-2.1013024044007396	-1.2230051624863665	-0.8463385153310374	-0.49924933622958273	-0.48860683195710775	-0.30471818091031744	-0.040123963906399274	0.11273565686532186	0.1705143238498199	0.3688879745537691	0.45094278584083186	0.5015177707297285	0.8081210477725684	1.0901815993396544	1.1767880033937548	1.7178543855289952	4.087180455295191	4.308489281446633	9.662632207110903	
The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.<br /><br />At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.<br /><br />The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise give this film a wide girth. Bava and Argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed.	-2.827854705042909	-1.8598742267565973	-1.6492868240346046	-1.6014885877192964	-1.4137927693892318	-1.2003420563721987	-0.9271742164145651	-0.4730352905883964	-0.12754537116090867	-0.060718496531930156	0.04243376294863471	0.05520736863902423	0.14958028602511073	0.17165807484735185	0.17558696417222652	0.18721916570923824	0.2342492177575665	0.28482748035208316	0.3276031788659842	0.3508399908597157	0.43057019574671934	0.847113307146908	0.9346141196284545	1.8463957188112055	3.715745355009843	
From time to time it's very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world.<br /><br />And that's what happens in "The Love Light", the first film directed by Dame France Marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter; better for her, certainly, because her career as a film director doesn't impress this German count.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti ( Dame Mary Pickford ) a merry Italian girl who lives surrounded by a "picturesque squalor" ( an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes; aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury" ); she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference. Destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and Dame Angela's two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead. But destiny is even crueller and Dame Angela meanwhile falls in love with a German!! And to make things worse, she doesn't know that her Teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal, don't mean "Ich Liebe Dich" but "Sink Any Damn Italian Boat At Sea"<br /><br />Fortunately for Dame Angela, pretty soon her sweetie German spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him ( a not strange fact, indeed, because it is not an easy task for a German to go unnoticed ) but the German spy will prefer to die before being captured by those Italians.<br /><br />From that German love, a half-Teutonic baby will born ( the wicked Destiny at full speed ) but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a Catholic nun who has taken the Council of Trent to extremes a fact that will put Dame Angela at the verge of insanity.<br /><br />But meanwhile Dame Angela's secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally Dame Angela's sorrowful life will improve; a tremendous mistake because Destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind. But as they say in Germany, it may be a blessing in disguise and finally Dame Angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor Italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people.<br /><br />As this German count said before, it was much better for Dame Frances Marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter, because as can be seen in "The Love Light", she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories, ja wohl! but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of Dame Pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces. The nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only Dame Pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances.<br /><br />And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must send Morse signals from the Schloss north tower to one of his Teutonic rich heiress.	-7.691042478662318	-3.3448213243588425	-3.3430483646087525	-2.8531021787348143	-2.7907517880528436	-1.9789277299507595	-0.9191832960834229	-0.5490325824005917	-0.428548653952709	-0.3943747093456973	-0.39399847566785057	-0.35620237727831094	0.12420627193403297	0.346082198760063	0.4334593993387401	0.44833838479250054	0.488694123204902	0.5839844371194585	0.7441976143558734	1.0953676615496726	1.1875364100724566	1.350397734022056	2.8514302097068978	4.009609797628294	7.903357715573685	
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Betty's pithy aunt, a limousine driver who's constantly asleep on the job, and Carmen Miranda playing herself (who else?). The stock shots of Argentina far outclass the action filmed on the Fox backlot, and some of the supporting performances are quite awful. By the time of the big horserace finale, most viewers will have had enough. *1/2 from ****	-3.9127539764463766	-1.6778195613937614	-1.6717244852067887	-1.5333469045090227	-1.4028013221012094	-0.7460553449437028	-0.6697628590573302	-0.6000961313706871	-0.37711268875455595	-0.36035589811662905	-0.27658976842624483	-0.21493067833632556	-0.04544377659488745	0.042653220158123804	0.07473013197953243	0.07806986860265747	0.1404239097620466	0.3248783736086371	0.3381556912782902	0.5319818502738668	0.5861645730861184	0.642368819329598	0.8373985239242869	1.7080836603205678	3.6204119506131267	
On the outside, this film is better because of Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order: Criminal Intent), but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version. In some ways, the 1999 version is better because it's more up to date (a decade as compared to the 27 years. The actors in this film were great, like Terry Kinney (McManus of HBO's "Oz") as James Daly and Tony Shalhoub (USA's Monk) and Gary Sinise (CSI:NY). Obvilubuly, dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences, nut much of the writing remained the same. There were stuff that wasn't in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy, but in the end, this film was just as great at the 1982 one. Character-wise: Vincent D'onofrio playing Phil Romano was excellent, better that Paul Sorvino. It's a match up between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney in terms of James. As for George, I would praise Shalhoub. And between Martin Sheen & Sinsise as Tom, I would say Sinise wins.	-2.3209104199038064	-1.5865934436146338	-1.5265816051644139	-1.1018653148582667	-0.8505820583360332	-0.542963929949934	-0.4389493827453256	-0.39551446067134005	-0.3504307377239699	-0.12065736550569059	-0.11075350779323871	-0.05251157502351125	-0.0072926394150281395	0.1407963532281346	0.14394202744887447	0.2378735404464617	0.2828024602790797	0.35506900480227066	0.45051454669794927	0.6600003798472933	0.7122153569101719	1.2115845698705698	1.3404614556909855	1.7493944656957496	3.3199088572418227	
typically, a movie can have factors like "arousing", "good feel", "sense of purpose", "plot", etc. There's always something that can be taken out of movies, its just a matter of how compelling the reason is, for me to own it in my collection. 'Tale of two sisters", as they call it when it was released in my country, has tremendous feel and an eventually (mostly) self-explaining plot. i love horror movies that revolve around a house. titles that come to mind are "The Others", "The Haunting", "The haunting of Hell House". this movie will be a another great example that i will remember. the movie had extremely rich colour, in the way the house was decorated, in the clothes that the characters wore, in the open-skied daylight scenes that is in contrast to most horror movies, which, typically makes use of desaturated tones and gloomy environs (think Honogurai mizu no soko kara, Dark Water, which is another show i like) that gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy when it wasn't in its, more, gripping moments. the characters are extremely believable. this may be partly attributed to the familiar setting of this movie. maybe domestic issues are easier for both myself as well as the actors to identify with, and the actors become their characters with exceptional finesse. the director toys with timelines, in order to give the audience the story in bits and pieces, allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation, instead of presenting everything in a linear fashion. this is a positive aspect of this film, in my opinion, and, perhaps, it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable. i would definitely look out for this on DVD.	-5.446023620538796	-3.5068432230174285	-1.9079732230397777	-1.6912687396103319	-1.175071660940334	-0.6610038452833901	-0.4764353360925008	-0.40965488943389095	-0.0537300811358562	0.3803446936683712	0.6569994364256382	0.7824089054685567	1.001957364736038	1.0413938007062258	1.5545140870298466	1.6122720683525606	1.6219302917915868	1.6350801248036437	1.6444900711818566	1.6877855926479546	2.214017897035508	2.300921382564111	2.5772826496695442	3.4168123055730235	5.104139011963849	
Why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.With great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily Oscar Awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but none match up to James Cameron's Masterpiece TITANIC.	-1.7197565820325182	-1.5144490310374916	-1.4730134009934002	-1.237300676218832	-1.1931505609153092	-0.6134744274714836	-0.41094966666303506	-0.39718261393009546	-0.18765270329345346	-0.06861686804571818	-0.048289996183959044	0.02476403789767498	0.08853605611083512	0.1156796948594036	0.32702714678015316	0.32767192421083147	0.4042925491213268	0.49035800950859304	0.613413867782113	0.6731258038225223	0.6735128169987062	0.9519439706354504	1.1730193696536886	2.011714311119632	3.6471091285111137	
Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it.<br /><br />A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having "killed" her own baby. I don't mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison.<br /><br />Buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe.<br /><br />This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors.<br /><br />Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native-born pronunciation, are outstanding. Those with supporting roles are also quite good.<br /><br />You will remember this movie for many years.<br /><br />See it!	-2.048430580754112	-2.0347961300066757	-1.6751222065415796	-1.0904583101630594	-0.7318079255297635	-0.6790963666733696	-0.49681357616236393	-0.4539747446935759	-0.45130553476569873	-0.37311985892891747	0.2882864374836968	0.34108037329070207	0.44055023627823936	0.4888826570779383	0.5014772355509752	0.660966145157988	0.663226398456449	1.0733087283226457	1.220832503757924	1.2422593450147905	1.2800753742154896	1.454290404406347	2.428030250610733	2.4540555610445702	3.354399147181757	
I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. I can't imagine this as even approaching "stoner classic." That would be like calling Singles a "grunge film." The movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.<br /><br />The characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who got killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend overdoses? Complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality.<br /><br />As for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background, neither moving forward or back.<br /><br />I kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order, the acting and dialog would improve or something, somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie. After 112 minutes, it never happened.	-6.491377094450962	-2.9580821177993157	-2.563686263626452	-2.197322520571433	-1.955204956673752	-1.3332373437843505	-1.2758024809869235	-1.1639109508393655	-0.9729826110988212	-0.6114864175485601	-0.2283181535224011	0.059039796473988104	0.256290289331039	0.37243690203888846	0.4405187923715796	0.45558650183459665	0.5126101562956209	0.5263037986219632	0.5346363516471238	0.5862853123148277	0.8247507267970337	0.8284354170311249	2.2478469080845307	3.9918817573587084	6.2787296348184825	
I've read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained. This movie is nothing. It's so badly written, directed and acted that it barely makes an impression. The characters speak in cliche-ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible. While that might make this campy and fun, it doesn't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true-to-life gusto or didn't have the cojones. This movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad Lifetime TV movie.	-3.638964732949765	-2.080073343345429	-1.8793880424569547	-1.7624069377741376	-1.6028004410213361	-1.5911367325743713	-1.4514566823420516	-0.6299687637143937	-0.22041719989114017	-0.1635980514539479	-0.08788635365834589	-0.04585636694927339	0.03627670438203595	0.13221653971517575	0.15472924816623335	0.36513678732359584	0.38003228281459733	0.5313564083624245	0.6413780920908952	0.7125971368130164	0.804070134984128	0.940858539557176	1.2820987619105093	2.6833945544171853	4.654063292440709	
Three words: Piece of Art. This film is just great. It's beautiful, sad, frightening and thought-provoking at the same time. The score constantly stays in my head, the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />It was more by chance than on purpose that I saw this movie. At the time I decided to watch this movie I was just bored and read lists of Asian films, which maybe good. Well, I saw the title "A tale of two sisters" which sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided "You don't just watch this film, you've gotta buy it". Said, done. I bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute.<br /><br />The plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end; the twist near the end of the film made me scream. I really didn't see something like this coming. And the ending scene made me cry...it just made me cry. It was so sad.<br /><br />Well, I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot, with scary scenes and atmosphere. Although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is, as I mentioned before, a very sad one. But this just fits in the mood of the film, doesn't it?	-3.8917826930390325	-3.1484390633174857	-3.109506712233392	-2.847549664954922	-1.7534516556531736	-1.589036112829273	-1.1190104268324244	-0.8464124576930464	-0.8115469699461852	-0.22707400455756696	0.05495851252516126	0.1478601895867403	0.34523544579255694	0.49494588429484554	0.5812086570690354	0.6000846710032512	0.9375307161795355	0.9732202777737831	1.0793015431669077	1.1007502154193507	1.150329449327353	1.856399779269562	4.294618268081657	4.6835795868424945	7.3678336832344975	
That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally , too.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad, too! One is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e'er she goes. The other is got up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual, slightly parted lips. And, not to give anything away, she is even more bad than the other.<br /><br />All three sisters are played by starlets. The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something of a career.<br /><br />This looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft-core porn ever marketed. Well, of course not the first but the raciest at that time.<br /><br />The girls wear as little as possible and let's not forget about the female audience members: Bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor -- whose fetish was this? -- bare-chested. He also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit.<br /><br />There's a real plot here, too: The girls' family, see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide -- or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide.<br /><br />The movie is not bad. I truly don't know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for drive-ins. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here. The women are scantily dressed. They often resemble lurid covers of mags like Police Detective or jackets of dime novels.<br /><br />But the guy seems to be the central focus. Not everyone in the movie likes him, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is meant to also.<br /><br />It's lots of fun -- and on its own terms, too.	-8.203570480099787	-6.438085839290771	-4.085934617113122	-4.047898421525999	-3.130827146042008	-2.439197789651872	-1.7581348913580355	-1.0746702461629372	-0.10420189322826481	0.1737031162552522	0.20558443200478743	0.26629976994619603	0.4303698722225996	0.5522247831761213	0.6071352187221711	0.7225527815610913	0.9979351110874504	1.2998883064634108	1.3206848625894818	1.6008025437467768	1.776540391019219	3.185136145400617	3.811851631450119	5.216421228785794	11.07435147979245	
How did I ever appreciate this dud of a sequel? All it does is throw balls! Worst of all, it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series! The comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintentional laughter go? Enough slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine-inning shutout. What's next, MAJOR LEAGUE 4: RETURN TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE? Ehh, could be! Leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. This one's had three strikes too many.	-4.446328093288424	-1.6161737505131546	-1.4088317411992302	-1.3685387490730885	-1.1188360782455973	-1.084059075565838	-1.017186060768216	-0.7745146969204583	-0.37986789944085136	-0.37540965062394016	-0.24763929288660852	-0.15960888785156782	0.07783156400763394	0.11788995234470723	0.2934470856976541	0.3451786093791064	0.35986319358642543	0.4826587565874766	0.6215063413409058	0.6912119656051621	0.6949935744581325	0.8515941690083126	1.2866655122150323	2.686060332645659	4.4655531075965875	
The film's subject is poignant and very real. It happened. One can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter. The subject is what makes the film tick--nothing else. I saw the film for the first time after the real Phoolan, was gunned down in New Delhi and had served several years as an elected Member of Parliament in India. By the way, she was not the first untouchable elected to Parliament, as some reviewers stated. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in reserved constituencies.<br /><br />While Shekhar Kapur as a director is a hero to many India, because he made commercially accepted international films---"Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a tolerable kiddie movie called "Mister India", which was accepted by the average Indian audiences)---and even got Oscar nominations for Elizabeth, I do not place him as a top notch film director from India. He fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above-average performances from his actors. Subtlety, finesse, charm are not easy to find in his films--melodrama brims in them.<br /><br />His idea of using Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film, was perhaps his single major achievement on the undistinguished sound track of "Bandit Queen". And then perhaps the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence. Otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them. <br /><br />If you are looking for a good living Indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international quality--it is not Shekhar Kapur's movies you should see; it is the later works of three Indian film-makers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen, and Girish Karnad and of course Muzaffar Ali's "Umrao Jaan". It is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that Kapur had to give them and their films an international viewership. For instance, Sen's "Oka oorie katha" made in Telugu, or Satyajit Ray's "Sadgati" based on Munshi Prem Chand's "Kafan" are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the untouchables in India. Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them. Of course, Sen's nugget did not make headlines, while Kapur's effort hogged them.<br /><br />To Kapur's credit, he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home audiences. For that effort, I salute Kapur. But "Bandit Queen" will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it.	-6.7381488341403815	-4.207209207808262	-3.7815070844117975	-3.4777311338220436	-2.357073003584739	-2.25896872874797	-2.0065840738648486	-0.399198885379338	-0.33155196834873285	-0.16512498252947932	-0.1007709859751512	-0.01842965852665665	0.015289665018946769	0.14400073499769994	0.5620062622829325	0.9341673276117097	1.035677329104772	1.1159926931718667	1.2698995464556795	1.5531535540069006	1.8585033753652747	1.9162123841025918	3.0076958225097625	5.085732209371396	9.9235066060097	
My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together...which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! As a lot has been written about the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved.<br /><br />I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with...<br /><br />On the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish..<br /><br />I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character, the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the RIGHT job! Kudos..!!!and Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful!	-2.4402284563541863	-1.906406504647856	-1.3979187077253075	-1.319983969232589	-1.2236988493215795	-1.0436881664089148	-0.8224802940005381	-0.7708142371060951	-0.3223756541954688	-0.2593158116924019	-0.06647515838400098	-0.05815059527764305	-0.04110178724124719	0.07632618795051843	0.12176116106938968	0.1822581724839028	0.2570452085485353	0.35447943067362186	0.46095643167802225	0.6510096690703507	0.6523674550763932	0.7302706510916261	1.0708764287103707	1.7158444137813293	2.0921384318575384	
"Tokyo Eyes" tells of a 17 year old Japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop. This lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk, and more talk. You'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and get a haircut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk, etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen. The thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value, a meager cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama...just incessant yadayadayada'ing.

The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in Mexico. This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch. Karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty, greedy and backbiting no-count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will. Pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place. Onetime Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of "Tintorera" infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and Julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character. The clunky, plodding (non)direction, trite by-the-numbers script, ugly, washed-out cinematography, ridiculous murder set pieces (a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon!), overwrought string score, morbid gloom-doom atmosphere, largely lousy acting (Karloff notably excepted), cheesy mild gore, poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm. A real campy hoot.	-2.56109674803544	-2.25744269595338	-1.943971082412809	-1.9073911189220676	-1.5442516225289775	-0.9441883307931216	-0.8590261439710732	-0.49338474509946817	-0.3360537415415513	-0.28947651624750564	-0.13236720941030006	-0.026030486271003073	0.09101392491215264	0.1644253363284535	0.22896837404996695	0.34108835281237926	0.4879334609413517	0.5179543922608972	0.522574620391348	0.7420855639296294	0.7516934698517462	0.8926512551622687	1.129924812363792	2.0064278076024706	3.4351706935871045	
The head of a common New York family, Jane Gail (as Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton) at "Smyrner's Candy Store". After Ms. Grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves, Ms. Gail and her policeman boyfriend Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman.<br /><br />"Traffic in Souls" has a reputation that is difficult to support - it isn't remarkably well done, and it doesn't show anything very unique in having a young woman's "virtue" threatened by sex traders. Perhaps, it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length (claimed to have been ten reels, originally). The New York City location scenes are the main attraction, after all these years. The panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move. <br /><br />**** Traffic in Souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin	-2.1118905395280234	-1.543756302279791	-1.3389877824797507	-1.2256885316209507	-0.9310547720046416	-0.7052440690492543	-0.5326567646265186	-0.5254088430107319	-0.1801393891896767	-0.1558135333379911	-0.14662608129785495	-0.10500035978344477	-0.06240223869016994	-0.022858031445188248	0.07757257967333339	0.19411807880541962	0.3526536200116072	0.4192729400217802	0.45195523745505617	0.6143863656845242	0.6291914158421588	0.6329210655364297	0.8575744228861166	1.7610000804437393	2.8824058237562413	
Previously, I wrote that I loved "Titanic", cried at its ending (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60's. I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.<br /><br />Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. <br /><br />In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in "Titanic". (To answer one other user: I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for "Titanic", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)<br /><br />Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of "Titanic" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). "Jumpin' Jack Flash" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH "TITANIC"? ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!! THAN "TITANIC", AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD. Again, "Titanic" got 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.<br /><br />Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?<br /><br />	-10.37028053251953	-5.695624111869341	-5.1522898556302525	-4.90503642452047	-4.887379167657548	-1.8386997593127772	-1.4410514845421545	-1.3607593027287892	-1.2618040438042781	-1.1999483568494724	-1.1348961553272676	-0.20605278275928174	-0.1971133073576098	-0.14454712181524818	0.5890851079055565	0.7361617415545123	0.8361428906937348	1.1504706532485722	1.9271278268151357	2.0947316564734244	2.2024339448553616	2.3147979412234174	2.3458163121062388	6.258273173850465	11.980861854627728	
The entire civilized world by now knows that this is where Emil Sitka says his immortal "Hold hands, you lovebirds." But Shemp Howard, Professor of Music, steals the show. Watch him tutoring Dee Green as she fractures the "Voices of Spring." Watch Shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. Watch him as he gets walloped by Christine McIntyre. Watch him, and you will laugh and learn. Moe is no slouch either. Watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap. Larry, as usual, is the Zen master of reaction. All in all, one of the very best Stooge shorts. You won't find one weak moment.	-2.214310974205859	-1.910932779860439	-1.3918796563763522	-1.3699405833929028	-0.7748039822386195	-0.6723741096980387	-0.6185431368674938	-0.5507508888623117	-0.22824483974771706	-0.19999356784058675	-0.1602781748079728	-0.055409229895076496	-0.02366287290672564	0.021538815075096356	0.11710514716493406	0.14040146001899947	0.22558454130133093	0.2683379884943262	0.8057494509542807	0.8591114106881803	1.1322539319312324	1.5357698804553304	1.6522181619580851	2.4257112934879372	4.1134736181514775	
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />It's marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it's nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.<br /><br />It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.<br /><br />Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers. Let's not forget, our bumbling former President actually came out and said that "God told him" to invade Iraq. And nobody questioned if he was hearing voices, or seeing things? <br /><br />Anyway, going of the subject here. No this movie has nothing to do with UFOs whatsoever, it's nothing more than a religious production.	-3.9778859547109438	-1.8472847102550163	-1.2483529508723539	-1.1659356031663006	-1.035469721975431	-1.0351312997452338	-0.6908525730721012	-0.4403136754445237	-0.32051096078388364	-0.3164749857408715	-0.2654964279222075	-0.08095402024302184	0.004437370482909875	0.3018907721186802	0.31935537589483365	0.34119887738564664	0.3787299699084554	0.47280171345192823	0.5242369363060836	0.6062466257705413	0.690796110526454	1.0250839801995004	1.5466416109227699	1.6208468098677271	3.8825962639811213	
Outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", only done on a low budget and much campier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!"<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute delight. Expect a little "Raiders..", a dash of "Batman", a little "The Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A prime candidate for DVD release, it is certainly overdue. An unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10	-2.568307101229646	-1.674268256127807	-1.5806327030256315	-0.9568139669176692	-0.5144760337036806	-0.42821500841749033	-0.42553425868395683	-0.33036340656822705	-0.2366455830724713	0.10670989535603981	0.14407097777931385	0.26700387026831945	0.2766509177666349	0.3665834401292366	0.44030897536039276	0.456936705898221	0.5483849168966087	0.5803221990154139	0.8229801395408737	0.8311783562082418	1.4052792570065216	1.8341729343771198	1.9775641628074132	2.1445355873888627	2.6220023227584894	
Yes, I admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget.<br /><br />I chuckle when I watch American comedies, I don't laugh. This movie made me laugh, but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high-budget American high school/pot-flicks.<br /><br />If you want good independent American comedy with pot-references, go watch Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater flicks or something. Don't waste your time on this piece of sh't movie.<br /><br />I mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot!<br /><br />And by the way: in Norway it's called "Dude, Where's My Pot"!	-2.4889318995196774	-1.4616319258530066	-1.2478642537095572	-0.9643490744105965	-0.9302949870698413	-0.8205228143376944	-0.5310641450354819	-0.5183483667698515	-0.38563011705480543	-0.28878034713547573	-0.08129646618615857	-0.00924122443705936	-0.004282960975551239	0.005077734796605102	0.011883196850026513	0.0910413321775628	0.14051827495808683	0.27354840937897856	0.46914158114752047	0.5348215269288683	0.664848045423173	0.9636197739655836	1.1447146988555132	1.5418218418214078	2.742550786554813

This movie was so heart warming. A true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs.It was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen.

This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up, but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers.<br /><br />Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park", (this is his directorial debut), from a novel by Nigel Balchin, it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. However, it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson, (the adulterous wife), and Rupert Everett, (the highly amoral high-class totty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye.	-2.8282990604588654	-1.6119831669162905	-1.4887763015381745	-1.1600185094416515	-1.0930333776533059	-1.0692744128254867	-0.5736597371797324	-0.29706133315638295	-0.2456668591189718	-0.04076065998600754	-0.02620518901448457	-0.020299474754151864	0.04124279848231746	0.187414686507925	0.25771555671503243	0.3049557529742452	0.4739848743207307	0.478678698137805	0.5134736233561135	0.5857162118935735	0.6075139171073328	0.6490948140854378	1.0583093685117086	1.8963785483871813	3.8052037562590395	
I went to the cinema to watch a preview of this film without knowing anything about it. Recognizing Jennifer Lynch's name and seeing the 18 certificate I realised it might be disturbing. In actuality I found the film a farce. I found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it. The acting is atrocious- Bill Pullman and his ridiculous twitching face. I do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction. After some shocking incident, (there is plenty to "try" and shock the viewer in this film), 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything was overstated, or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious! The performance from the little girl character named Stephanie was the best thing about the film. Quiet and intense. I really could not recommend this film to anyone. Its violent without point, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and plain silly.	-5.190581923591251	-3.00217871210766	-2.8850229991815723	-2.29221756111104	-1.7332733968985667	-1.6880005900058141	-1.251093911410691	-0.887955335024153	-0.5108327478947544	-0.41544942721748895	-0.12273625258597898	-0.08360329848498788	-0.07169128974024941	0.24964143543327902	0.258313728709738	0.320806341358321	0.683978898960564	0.8020261117375891	0.9669231272447516	1.0901173571936797	1.172419965545461	1.3285010473295085	1.7856974125120895	3.7373406359188976	5.962440860471019	
-The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her. Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog. This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that's really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.<br /><br />-This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time. The production designs are just stunning in this movie. From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema. The music and songs are also well done. Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, "I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas" as one of the great musical moments in movies. I'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.<br /><br />-What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like "Two Towers" and "Silent Hill". Way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. One of my favorite shots in "Two Towers" is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that's what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie. They're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings.<br /><br />-It's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of "Aladdin" got their inspiration. The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet. It's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that I'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie. I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it's amazing. That's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time. Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break. Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard.<br /><br />-If you ever wanted to see a live action version of "Aladdin" then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea.	-5.38503635308476	-3.9591508576971677	-3.4331718654234775	-2.893238766731833	-2.577362534808119	-1.9910622426290843	-1.7764575868913015	-1.1633712031240415	-0.693810907226075	-0.03398587232220143	0.02033731180978758	0.2778871812318226	0.37506282335341057	0.5561796752101028	0.6059368194699318	0.9088703226436576	0.9903585202006662	1.3729704839180272	1.6647073188037709	1.6928945461430407	2.6718354737576115	3.020250935619607	5.612908191081106	6.366960290390591	9.599530456344276

An utterly beautiful film, one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do, in Thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time. By the '90's my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again.<br /><br />Idealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out, but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne. After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu, Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures (although apparently not enough for Sabu!) and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything. The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940, but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later. Anyway, if I'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects! Favourite bits: the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Hall's suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend  in fact, the stunning colours throughout; Sabu and Rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale. Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and Casablanca, and then died. John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers, both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted, but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions: only pure love mattered.<br /><br />There's a couple of mildly violent images in it, but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100% positive message, it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer. One of my Top 10 film favourites, I can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of Time.	-1.9659317076604252	-1.6940318341301874	-1.3604304357345645	-0.9392747278772833	-0.882955219905986	-0.742595149204594	-0.6558618516339827	-0.27219801184039255	-0.2715279597033771	-0.204711834754301	-0.13497502081847446	-0.058152840860000415	-0.024497339648322458	0.050123693470318004	0.14173466672878163	0.166801436990837	0.2821625731426276	0.43160869262990953	0.45348699014970323	0.6418173568903659	1.7666165375041616	1.8207863545712586	2.118678910947883	2.120232171678477	3.4132726929984027	
If there is one film which is the worst of this year- it's TASHAN The first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring Dhoom 2 style film, and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe Because of it being a Yashraj film Or maybe seeing the cheesy promo But this film gave me a shock, it was even worst then Dhoom 2 and what i expected First Saif's introduction which is boring Then Saif- Kareena meet, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what he is doing in such a weird film? What kinda role it is? What acting is he doing? His first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts Then came Akshay who provided some nice scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff Childhood romance, overdose of childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The ending is another joke<br /><br />Vijay Krishna Acharya would have got 3 films more to direct, if this film had worked, thats the strategy of yashraj, only money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers Music( Vishal Shekhar) is ordinary<br /><br />Performances Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air, he actually provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more Rest are okay	-2.3513177689057665	-1.5191357230081506	-1.4125325040034706	-1.2538416292834562	-1.2506065569083376	-0.8264509924509195	-0.6130878824627725	-0.503955011305403	-0.48634152044683526	-0.38491585052966637	-0.37968693196519954	-0.315958433556253	-0.22440457848152717	-0.20688464140428026	-0.07534019444905718	-0.0331043929813882	0.12255390491903402	0.13952523010031093	0.14910994208405304	0.3378901764843185	0.5936895967714948	0.703377576097429	1.2158100965502794	1.3573474608376561	2.0923847234112434	
This is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for. If you watch T.V., then you might as well not watch the movie. Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one which just happens to be Jennifer Annisten being the funny one. It is typical Jim Carrey humor and it is really funny. Just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised. All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies this is a must-see, otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied.	-2.157822453652448	-1.0705281001102698	-1.037116659813202	-0.82079860568345	-0.8009688215643166	-0.6605822930894159	-0.6249498897880625	-0.24010356118655896	-0.08595565526013742	0.0016476113220498002	0.015814998033656706	0.03698235749807152	0.0717015220378387	0.19555673174267715	0.2020233977196938	0.2629853585863008	0.26514664713239217	0.34187920491353296	0.5310401267115725	0.5557468085821868	0.7312539220959389	0.8243508310423562	0.8578329937516858	1.644797754296972	3.38192016062331	
I've seen worse films. This is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. It rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre.<br /><br />It is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. Awfully charming rather than just plain awful.<br /><br />The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. Upon turning up she exclaims "Bunnyfluff!" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.<br /><br />Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!	-3.3659140099255653	-1.8105969500436503	-1.698963024012474	-1.237928081357227	-1.0509718031620747	-1.0122202264302924	-0.8136176029741953	-0.15078966289653153	-0.10143118242109556	-0.06301557779305801	-0.010237383227043123	0.031832410051108706	0.10619922580822624	0.22671503075979585	0.2576078029569594	0.30163899763518476	0.3120372133245518	0.6050145078651153	0.6182223926677031	0.6806031292139599	0.9820133617442994	0.9824539653624083	1.1066787761884505	2.0441125291912483	4.107471486162788	
Awful. This thriller should have buried. What a piece of crap. Terrible writing, characters are less than believable. Horrible Schlock!! Stick some B- stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a little credit, but it fails miserably. If I didn't have to write ten lines about this movie I would have given it a word word review, it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'.<br /><br />Horrible ending, retarded. Who writes this crap. The ending of this film is so contrived, weak it's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line, or they just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie. It's a good thing that these actors are on the way out, because this would be a career killer. Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it. At least no one important, like future investors. It could have ended a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel cheated out of my precious time.<br /><br />Don't bother with this one, you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back.	-7.641149995833649	-4.055117112490041	-3.8900645446878466	-3.8230144235016916	-3.696051538977166	-1.6404510128579834	-1.1339770783547056	-0.978747053950303	-0.8325366319191164	-0.7953631270822801	-0.6204187343175771	-0.5174442609526488	-0.22456232420160702	-0.14186523233099757	-0.1336990676517903	0.0022966243859906255	0.1896339632368103	0.2838151733136058	1.279382365974577	1.4262172141663865	1.675279993590766	1.8520948466606226	2.2120646110951787	4.5381393670658525	7.671295913453257	
Are you kidding me? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the dialog. And the music was nothing great. Anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. Anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. I felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. And what does a Kansas teen know about shopping in Soho....couldn't we have had a better line here? Was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over-mixed way to loud music.	-3.8199696867241766	-2.042196701015353	-1.9924338191381297	-1.6437759310278892	-1.0964951821202176	-1.0472479395146252	-0.5846243960311067	-0.34999323393742493	-0.29507647390339803	-0.22970501550821637	-0.06842103144254234	-0.06283591568935373	0.02334923938701622	0.33796314050797926	0.4505503630548437	0.5151291847264368	0.5177362045585738	0.522002066065796	0.5893874438289941	0.6715591296645401	0.7174283122719204	0.7670116027632375	1.7829698676378394	2.254902732464777	4.787675572122208	
When I watched L'Appartement with my girlfriend, she sighed: "How complicated!" And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple, one-linear plots, especially violent hero vs crook schemes, L'Appartement is hard to follow. A couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points. Other whine about the confusing flash backs. Come on! This is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet, come back and get hooked again within a few seconds. This one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details. Then it is really not that hard to figure out what's happening and when. The director has left more than enough clues in all scenes.<br /><br />The first 3/4 of the movie centers about the question: why did Max and Lisa split? The film, as my girlfriend remarked, begins as a romantic lovestory, suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience with French movies, I predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and I was right. In the end of the first part it becomes clear, after many twists and turns, that Max and Lisa were manipulated by Alice. Max did not know, that Lisa had left and why. Lisa did not know, why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace, when she returned to Paris. The only one who did was Alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut.<br /><br />After both Max and Lisa have found out the truth, the question of course becomes: can Alice's manipulations be undone? Well, of course not, time has passed by and things have changed.<br /><br />Many European movies use a story telling technique I fully enjoy. There is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning, after which two (or more) interested parties try to decide in their own advantage. Instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique. In the first half Alice seems to be a side character; slowly it becomes clear, that she is key figure.<br /><br />Acting is simply great. Vincent Cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character, who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Belucci is very beautiful of course, but also competent. Jean Paul Ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch. Romane Bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman, plagued by feelings of guilt and regret.<br /><br />The only reason I did not gave it a 10 is the somewhat unsatisfying end. Of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events Max is exactly on the point where the movie begun, only wiser and sadder. Alice has paid for her sins. But still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial. Max too easily exchanges Lisa for Alice; Alice too easily decides to reject Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max too easily returns to his fiancée. But then again, I don't know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry. I guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty.	-10.237754567511331	-7.282035211763209	-5.844819094677792	-4.824795870106525	-4.20095145678831	-3.372436185244787	-2.6149402520990486	-0.3346153957634296	-0.14821669568358825	0.23677541137729385	0.2520430759886154	0.31521504596077393	0.46573721288894354	1.0249264766713704	1.14550044598366	1.3986166717439112	1.411902399644312	1.9115926349976702	1.976973695827875	2.4803550339893263	2.5845990804441508	2.776641579930511	5.060038372981985	7.187033470782976	15.868895527014118	
I wasn't terribly impressed with Dante's 1st season offering in "Homecoming", it wasn't much of a horror story, but rather a smart political statement with the undead. Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women. The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists. Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home. I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but is unclear because this is never revisited. The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah.It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.	-5.055581048994278	-2.3968212443150128	-2.1251108679808453	-1.9499298381932735	-1.8144299616075634	-1.7319033029960276	-1.052227618976417	-0.7639674523252105	-0.3296770978024016	-0.3003754780758867	-0.2683837323444137	-0.14680731245958137	-0.1420225781839776	0.009711394133548532	0.09343097482478943	0.13441039565171117	0.15263831276542883	0.44405670978672	0.4678891071660089	0.5773119726334888	0.6146771877805979	0.7568185235448746	2.4558012249100973	2.458397127778991	5.290018531783474	
Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one got under my skin (pardon the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies. Not only did I find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the "screwee", I felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself. Some parts are very reminiscant of "Hellraiser", but come off as tribute rather than imitation. It's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but I enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile. This piece brings it and doesn't appologize. I liked this one a lot. Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding.	-1.7511049266577745	-1.3854940713494965	-1.2139386571136987	-1.10740909698803	-0.8503419811996508	-0.6209424860812942	-0.6054195943337518	-0.3933352364142775	-0.23891668314547349	-0.22397714124835755	-0.1030425313635778	-0.06253506804273988	-0.05180688967884653	-0.0166718380709885	0.07401918809223829	0.14215619848621888	0.2326183164482244	0.27452054443635254	0.5487528587453856	0.5676854012032312	0.5917117056262796	0.953533409223135	1.3763723510325017	1.7820178763528327	2.232000962952707	
Simply not the quality I expected from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very much like a not so bad student film. What concerns me, in all this is WHY DID IT WIN A BAFTA??? Morris makes fun of 'enshrined mediocrity' (Ayn Rand) in much of his work (Nathan Barley) and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining! <br /><br />I just hope as he has chosen a subject I would love to tackle (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that he isn't going to cock that up, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena.	-2.063969233882812	-1.157347908102143	-1.1510599729184126	-0.9181912162268878	-0.6956215923950718	-0.675265889413268	-0.49311824551280065	-0.19006766128152422	-0.16235043796005177	-0.0958561451012579	-0.021855275553041842	0.031216586078339423	0.035213282041766436	0.04036613502456443	0.14416800107205835	0.20647559675245641	0.20734984959187108	0.23355413755765808	0.4598419423488872	0.5087596195587761	0.5139843027597781	0.5437472649898583	0.7078459462745528	1.6144459713001642	2.6181873971100798	
This would probably be a good film to see....provided you've already seen every other film in existence, and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you. God, this movie was unbelievably insipid, with some of the worst (or is it nonexistent) writing ever captured on film. There is no saving grace to this film; even the animatronics are kind of lame, and it's just a complete waste of time and money.<br /><br />Run. Fast.

Most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm. Not so this gloriously bent, batty and berserk over-the-top Italian-made shot-in-Canada kitsch gut-buster: It's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over-baked "what the hell's going on?" crackpot excess and inanity.<br /><br />A freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30-foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70's disco stud (complete with jumbo wavy afro) perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice. They dethaw the beast, jolt him back to life with electric charges, grossly mistreat him, and keep the poor hairy Goliath in an enormous glass booth. Before you can say "Hey, the filmmakers are obviously ripping off 'King Kong'," our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage, grabs the first luscious nubile blonde Euro vixen (the gorgeous Pheonix Grant) he lays lustful eyes on, and storms away with his new lady love. The yeti gets recaptured and flown to Toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience. Of course, he breaks free again, nabs the vixen, and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage.<br /><br />The sublimely stupid dialogue (sample line: "Philosophy has no place in science, professor"), cheesy (far from) special effects (the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy Tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw-dropping awfulness), clunky (mis)direction, and a heavy-handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere "Is the yeti a man or a beast?" ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen. Better still, we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew: the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti's nipples, which causes it to harden and elicits a big, leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth (!); the vixen nurses the yeti's wounded hand while he makes goo-goo eyes at her, the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building, and the furry fellow even breaks a man's neck with his toes (!!). Overall, this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should-be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that's eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following.	-6.010908883806599	-3.0617674045767167	-3.057168684965486	-2.4683238913288577	-2.1796293894175007	-2.014168545973899	-1.20568335127072	-1.0502664391983523	-0.8024905167060985	-0.5186066180975396	-0.3445532156384613	0.17228707148839914	0.2977302963031488	0.3364503441079019	0.36465922970961984	0.3826106810319475	0.41166970731839403	0.43928712487335025	0.6565133013344977	0.8466971270923634	0.9271296640679113	0.9979783072086135	1.313112831478666	3.2808289841649834	6.033624899417962	
It's been a while since I've watched this movie, and the series, but now I'm refreshing my memory! This was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee. When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes off their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around Hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal. They soon realize that Boss Hogg is gonna strip-mine Hazzard County, unless the Dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds wasn't right for the part of Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was way too serious. Other than that, I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD!!!	-2.1651142343729397	-1.9110684612331599	-1.7609910277949363	-1.4759490482282969	-1.4069527723903166	-1.3082935559421403	-0.9421857077536788	-0.5770813780202502	-0.5391223774228309	0.006610211877915342	0.02336640844166965	0.3148840723116741	0.3323298251520025	0.47279512510308125	0.5727921873517936	0.5929327007394108	0.7256188472826867	1.0045047857297285	1.061872101161021	1.2343753431229525	1.4082159652864705	1.414526420204361	2.4863604510068145	3.0641763143993703	3.7915190095546722	
Beyond the Clouds is in many ways the weirdest film I have ever seen. Not for its Cult appeal, gore, or even for its ideas, but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema. Beyond the Clouds was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy's most famous directors. However, if you gave this film only a quick watch-over, passively I mean, it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances. This movie deserves great attention, to the point of embracing all its cheese. By cheese I don't mean a slice, but a whole brick of cheddar! The music seems like it's from some Italian porno, the story and dialogue like they are from a corny Japanese soap, and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head.<br /><br />But once you get passed all this, you are engaged in an existential work of art. The cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention, perfectly, to what needs to be known. The basic plot is of four chapters, unrelated, and all about love. What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate to each other. Instead they can only communicate through each other. I suppose that's why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy, because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people's reaction overly melodramatic.<br /><br />I left that film thinking to myself; maybe all life is one big melodrama. We judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful. I hate, because I have reason. But what does the hated think? Maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic.<br /><br />So melodrama is actually an existential function. A corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass, allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do.<br /><br />This is a great film, I recommend it to all!	-4.960580652444107	-4.7383336256372175	-4.395196656175591	-3.430778983122703	-1.9303009730784741	-1.7053059578005187	-1.4807328511459792	-0.9866780977467693	-0.9787869838069285	-0.2814763178434535	-0.12320245547972536	0.4824573366217447	0.5768201886896471	0.677243045076996	0.7079628290282631	0.7352423710520597	0.8309445197083773	0.9206438973452141	1.0855071749146632	1.5090363076820377	1.574969424250768	2.3348319764983017	4.513496630088783	5.050045653856455	9.555278599710379	
Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. Set against a smoggy Phoenix skyline, post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star turn as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times" while JFK impersonator James Franciscus lounges around the fringes. <br /><br />Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Bob Mitchum is in there too. Somewhere.	-2.361754900506875	-1.489361910504676	-1.432948591495517	-1.355937367004528	-1.281503636999054	-0.6467149551202311	-0.3720577495080039	-0.29467642321831977	-0.2871980851977447	-0.27307106846524787	-0.1953497775471731	-0.16035687354649228	-0.13995529441998705	-0.13963412984136314	0.13061113853361328	0.14594681842896137	0.3024561412819572	0.30435620989677903	0.45861516319887347	0.459419198231545	0.5041375240249995	0.6076136333048652	0.8196438755509252	1.3714290604458637	2.204801414433926	
This review contains some small, yet significant, spoilers.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I just finished watching my copy of Noroi...<br /><br />...and it was GREAT! This might sound cheesy, but several times during the film I forgot it wasn't real XD The acting is convincing, although the acting from Masafumi Kobayashi (playing himself, I think...) seems a bit hokey at times. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in Takashi Shimizu's Rinne) seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie: sometimes she's REALLY good, then the next moment she's really cheesy (especially at the end's exorcism and subsequent re-possession.<br /><br />A character that was ridiculous at first was Mr. Hori, a man covered in tinfoil believing "ectoplasmic worms" are coming to eat everyone. He provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning (acting like the stereotypical alien abduction-type victim) but near the end has some really creepy scenes.<br /><br />The plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together. There are some things that aren't really explained (like a mass suicide in a Tokyo park and where the reincarnated Kagutaba-boy came from) but everything else turned out fine. The ending has GOT to be one of the most unnerving, if not the scariest, sequences I've ever had the pleasure to witness.<br /><br />All in all, Noroi is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD provides great picture and sound (most importantly the English SUBTITLES- Engrish free!) for a great J-Horror experience. I highly recommend picking it up.	-2.5220526881711725	-2.4956382332102924	-2.181861849478395	-1.6987484538776174	-1.2370343599986047	-1.1978148871167549	-1.0318140632845216	-0.6149300223792965	-0.4856626717519098	-0.4191140606552729	-0.3904505780265326	-0.19973592145911845	-0.04032999918103236	0.08407160860545919	0.3915115753397411	0.4247771942847741	0.49628311500403843	0.6396678277410325	1.1036507483330626	1.2034837862783492	1.4008181035066336	1.5231687424478566	2.171353280178464	3.2276305734864343	4.670582411585421	
I love the movies and own the comics, the comics are different then the movie but still I'd give it: 10 out of 10. It was awesome. If the movies got anymore awesome. I would have her babies. And I am female. Read the comics you won't regret it. Yes in this movie since Brian P. the artist for her died we don't get nearly as good artistic work. I mean seriously don't get me wrong these people did great, but different versions for different people. Different Strokes for different folks as the saying goes. Any guy who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane, or does not like women, or you know just plan insane. If I could count on my fingers how in love and how many times I have read the comics I would run out of fingers for sure, but hey there is always toes.	-2.863719166142173	-1.8875549735899035	-1.452257349356311	-1.1707263514073292	-0.801723226965372	-0.7045572285460591	-0.6955457586783863	-0.5765148466331688	-0.5295014448327341	-0.3715653345904808	-0.28995287184389573	-0.2679438653448358	-0.22687023341745588	-0.15692400770766843	0.008219064183727589	0.1665530006344475	0.17193619844285593	0.34377417365529855	0.6137093689374737	0.7136428526599049	0.8588965486915846	0.8610028301559995	1.6001208771502677	1.666566138458396	2.9271442618148202	
>>> Great News there is a BBC DVD release scheduled for 31st July 2006,UK - there is also a scheduled release in States - don't know the date - can't wait ! ! <<<<<br /><br />>>>> below is my original comment <<<<<<br /><br />I agree with all the other reviewers - it is simply staggering that one of the greatest TV dramas ever has never been released on DVD<br /><br />The story line is gripping - the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling !<br /><br />Over here in the UK we have quite a history of getting TV drama series and films out onto DVD through popular campaigns <br /><br />It's very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a DVD production ? I'm going to e:mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens. Who did the production ? was it BBC ?

I just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about. So here's what my reactions to it are. It's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors. The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists. This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film. However, the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all. It just bored me. This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes. All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below.<br /><br />************Contains spoiler************ I find the rape scenes quite tame. I don't know if I have watched the cut or uncut version, if there is actually such a version. I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot. Here's a list on top of my mind.<br /><br />Why don't the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are. That would be an excellent time.<br /><br />Why don't they just gang rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifer's ordeal by such a long time. It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.<br /><br />I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house. Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.<br /><br />These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right, they shouldn't send a coward imbecile to do the job.<br /><br />Why didn't Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? Which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /><br />Why didn't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive?<br /><br />I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him. ************************Ends spoiler************<br /><br />But hey, this movie is not without its merits, Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer, `Why me? Why Me, I didn't even c^m!!!'	-11.732830723898442	-5.226062691291556	-5.135418089929519	-4.636788805080464	-4.436023674410397	-4.358204195800646	-3.3171965095895306	-1.411405697891968	-0.6262418406230308	-0.43914806922701205	-0.14221087269881844	0.03200706321991518	0.143034836302258	0.37019944255761783	0.41203012254274407	0.4949062468042472	0.8429412481670924	1.831629270524763	1.9418748602197864	1.9581632150845154	1.9802152227575016	2.9929974271500006	4.265457021627808	6.523672491130324	14.000895473311088	
Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred. <br /><br />Novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall. <br /><br />One obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned. The monk recounts the history of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts away to something else. Earlier the monk had offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house, although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care.<br /><br />There are some (probably) unintentional campy laughs in seeing the American actors at the end become possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts, I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's Motel Hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing, but on the whole this is a forgettable dud.	-5.183811117196924	-2.6859778098814613	-2.614271319194807	-2.5699012647382515	-2.5106391593639645	-1.274702494790324	-0.5328079353669675	-0.49549844200910165	-0.36118353416537835	-0.30583725727366806	-0.2728522230691998	-0.22945730895809396	-0.21162660225803429	-0.11031497790655556	-0.09993437510261749	0.27903907867829053	0.39015122299127497	0.488300067725526	0.49830093002679493	0.5869786048686773	0.7947955439324754	1.1420738256247633	2.070770503347554	2.745205486015566	5.019177757527215	
Thank God! I didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it! This happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life, f*****g visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Far apart from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie. OK if you get time after reading this comment, please check out the director's(Ulli Lommel) profile. After seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this, i mean every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him, but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence. Even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.	-2.8944816521560224	-2.0332004036021467	-1.7071957209485982	-1.580815057901936	-1.0926666619984025	-1.0765153297556411	-0.6133770977684616	-0.3316159218471643	-0.29563534607921194	-0.2037657119831439	-0.15392604199708304	-0.03950754852675932	0.03813740025248726	0.07896478116362622	0.20634877202337487	0.3454618014250738	0.37590243866764494	0.4994768348231219	0.5748136186283201	0.59416892364592	0.6078159311844639	0.9113356122346103	1.324617420467594	1.9190667122883782	3.348895613216992	
Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was PAINFUL to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didn't work at all.	-3.710227869969225	-2.0541444460342007	-1.8522409028732616	-1.8267435297388077	-1.6416150857005594	-0.6688866627838239	-0.589224704284235	-0.5645887320862952	-0.5191294081795363	-0.38803290661164275	-0.3484084762289488	-0.23347708045885648	-0.1441529846429376	0.12910865560928314	0.1643781813150269	0.24354855880972937	0.5366748630809779	0.6511778049340264	0.6756819755832076	0.7123695041122852	0.9227537904351751	1.0116976138857892	1.3371503576161894	2.2719979429510158	4.036787454492883	
This film is one giant pant load. Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay. And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process. <br /><br />The worst though is Woody Harrelson, whom I ordinarily like when he's properly cast. He plays "the walker", a homosexual man in D.C. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite. He couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. His "southern accent" is that "off the rack" version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But, his is not the worst accent in the movie. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is German, and speaks several languages - one of them being Italian! That's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think? <br /><br />From the story, to the screenplay, to the directing, to the camera work, to the performances by the leads, this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. In fact, all three are excellent, in spite of being trapped in a really bad film. Ufortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.	-8.862733081792777	-4.062847918635426	-4.024088015375691	-3.755985154362485	-3.3678425867928494	-2.979997023309795	-2.6686687621427367	-0.7010080815301455	-0.4364296526798178	-0.17096419502121327	-0.13686796244897503	-0.11603408424179926	-0.02554675817865737	0.11090531598477729	0.12920737645495314	0.5828824907216408	0.8958246894742098	1.432913637275699	1.6209575454527259	1.7155134369123093	1.9177883095966903	2.4175758952321345	3.1004485642387865	5.238247597435149	10.211706019731581	
... and I DO mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen every movie ever created!), at least, obviously, among the ones, the many I know.<br /><br />5.3 ??? The rule of thumb with IMDb is this: sometimes movies rated very highly (for example, the piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboy") can be truly bad. But rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6. This movie, very much worth watching, is. A disgrace.<br /><br />True, I give it a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9. It has some acting flaws (Belafonte especially), the script wanders around, sometimes. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times, the Czech Jan Kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, larger-than-life Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in an acting/poetic/moral tour de force. A pair made in Heaven! It's true that this movie, little flaws apart, does not pander to the average audiences, but those interested in watching an excellent (while, again, not beyond criticism) movie of the incomparable director who gave us "The Shop on the Main Street" (the best movie ever about Holocaust) should not miss this just because some silly IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine".<br /><br />It isn't.	-3.642822036936782	-2.911623723873055	-2.4340322864479833	-1.9795216088500696	-1.5465962832226023	-0.7990922782396949	-0.7524506667608728	-0.5672642282725346	-0.481509625794535	-0.4343076023065068	-0.27092856101994506	-0.21244608476885868	-0.017458960508799484	0.20731257997334626	0.37203295203996833	0.3890285862487809	0.5634541536602403	1.0031448299930603	1.1490850801978567	1.1904041208455334	1.3867450429438135	1.519239953974403	2.8531425522094267	3.2151420112974964	6.012158337790585	
Since this cartoon was made in the old days, Felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today. However, compared to its contemporaries, it's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well. That's because despite its age, the cartoon is very creative and funny.<br /><br />Felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can't sell any shoes. Well, Felix needs money so he can go to Hollywood, so he tells the guy at the shop he'll get every shoe sold. Felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes--rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store. In gratitude, the guy gives Felix $500! However, Felix's owner wants to take the money and go alone, so Felix figures out a way to sneak along.<br /><br />Once there, Felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself. Along the way, he meets cartoon versions of comics Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin. In the end, though, through luck, Felix is discovered and offered a movie contract. Hurray!	-3.7534978174372635	-2.3587824612503496	-1.8714108844760764	-1.645205518663527	-1.3478934720245919	-1.3250629304473944	-0.6924701093305694	-0.5864642045352297	-0.35576456014347513	-0.2971533130866152	-0.2874577110151836	-0.1944494412828796	-0.17713594251694417	0.1543043582191093	0.3072677177185844	0.4159852550116612	0.5075752153528366	0.5910764923630988	0.6732922140348985	0.7267781818730562	0.9133011351535869	1.156573942272114	1.2457678483027812	2.555301673702197	5.153802352269256	
Beyond The Clouds is a hauntingly beautiful, elegiac work of art. The overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in, makes you want to touch the screen. The autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. Or, to put it another way, an old man. I know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as Beyond The Clouds. Nearly all the people in this film are beautiful, unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo, that is. The dialogue doesn't really matter too much, not that there is much of it anyway, and as for storylines, forget it. Some films exist just as visual experiences, this is one of them. Don't bother if you want "simple entertainment",this not for you.<br /><br /> I could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but I won't. If you are at all interested in cinematography, photography, film direction etc., watch this film.	-2.566895207745046	-1.8575660884678697	-1.5316139395222874	-1.3070490342016652	-1.0218366690916385	-0.6957430439472665	-0.5996287090333998	-0.5243458592393404	-0.45155424234054864	-0.037531560080293305	0.2092032678680625	0.28791835521202813	0.30629161354357815	0.347757497401914	0.44024265494143233	0.4699912312857971	0.5184316113968862	0.5975221080293507	0.6018006423917102	0.6889373835244171	0.8947818887147272	1.263654891861272	2.546922350440348	2.663757397598735	4.157019296900055	
This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, its horrible. Christopher Lee is good but he is hardly in it, the only the good part is the opening scene.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the title.

If there's one good suspenseful film, this is one of them. James Stewart puts on a dazzling performance as American Dr. Ben McKenna who, with his wife and son, are in Africa on tour. They stumble on a murder scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later.<br /><br />Before you can say, "Fasten your seat belts," Dr. McKenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it. However, other people know he can be dangerous, (dangerous to them, that is) and try to dispose of him.<br /><br />Eventually, Hank, the son, is found alive and well.<br /><br />If you like suspenseful movies, this is the one to watch.<br /><br />My Score: 8/10.	-1.6007545473642044	-1.2641514900013302	-1.1324588514681944	-1.1103782511089508	-1.0785842562713932	-0.50490731757532	-0.48412856864673626	-0.4283668628640891	-0.31137146593765663	-0.19616878087973155	-0.09182412656267283	-0.05665093915292423	0.01858121376956054	0.02937376083959614	0.05947674214629607	0.19669833481809842	0.3370683794049993	0.49843814022731736	0.7263554710723981	0.7626879659100391	0.7667029477883963	0.8880131765142176	1.0837156820642566	1.9349826671868522	3.211732388197166	
An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film.<br /><br />Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.<br /><br />A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution. Solidly acted by the principals. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film.<br /><br />My recent foray into Chinese film (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring. China and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent Chinese film.<br /><br />	-4.258066130527956	-2.099347802376694	-1.3401044225601326	-1.135499781897509	-0.588700951328654	-0.2394638989405934	-0.1628469449607938	-0.09183829251225241	-0.08990839062174304	0.21719188405508785	0.3581337568003246	0.5350283288217037	0.7466275863207736	0.8049416744007057	0.9392524352290249	0.9670075866987389	1.2608687307382713	1.462175856036739	1.4814304830131186	1.495710021031094	1.5955853231643355	1.884503092653732	1.9661736121148707	3.0914697220270555	3.812872707758564	
<br /><br />JURASSIC PARK III *___ Adventure <br /><br />Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ(a Leoni (Family Man)<br /><br />A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF REALLY MEAN DINOSAURS. But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.<br /><br />ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects. Sure, there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no meaningful plot line to tie them together. The dinosaur puppets and animation in JP3 are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever. But the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2.<br /><br />JP3 is a mercifully short 90 minutes -- the last 10 minutes of which is credits. Even at that, I found myself frequently checking my wristwatch. The audience I saw it with left the theater in silence.<br /><br />A better bet: see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE.<br /><br />Dave	-6.211620486613844	-2.6987933618182733	-2.450390641983093	-2.057191263502822	-1.990861899636779	-1.766169778278917	-1.5108026414197808	-0.2819580822073596	-0.24843671150080232	-0.24113651782745604	-0.11852123206952259	-0.10311202481066227	0.07794399539128409	0.3571184815906301	0.36350604306986056	0.41877595824419916	0.5801225045122184	0.7679882947127592	1.1218572486294787	1.3376622205221962	1.4509746354965578	1.600956311332801	2.5523361812310927	3.205933396973546	7.391200121919207	
This could have been interesting  a Japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed American family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director.<br /><br />The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare, i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to! Besides, it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as, generally, the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way, such as Susan George seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family Doug McClure and Edward Albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /><br />At one point, an old monk turns up at the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually, he's called upon to exorcise the premises. However, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! At the end of the day, this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential viewing.	-4.087933494536282	-1.907851758697935	-1.76651774880506	-1.7454743984374343	-1.7119135867608806	-1.2046618469064365	-0.49547324377732227	-0.4832327412941025	-0.30015523760621465	-0.29301874406420686	-0.1466602064543377	-0.12969910651200378	-0.02025298133701129	0.07329964121456281	0.11847676897770171	0.135681618834662	0.18308361660399008	0.2502199100261343	0.32165524431520376	0.445205295181333	0.5591314672679217	0.691257809560096	1.906486068120802	2.1848231518632986	4.222908769450296	
I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fu**ed my head. Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing. The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well. I haven't seen the UK or Japan version, but I have to say that I believe that the German DVD is a bit censored. If you haven't seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes, but at the showdown I felt that something was missing, about one or two very short scenes.<br /><br />All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I like Miike for!!	-2.1266607384146523	-1.3812027644206917	-0.895666405191266	-0.8148686967946303	-0.7668013214133237	-0.6096470350393712	-0.5386006861144841	-0.33444489774395814	-0.23512279461788896	-0.12366259578855399	-0.10045343665858504	-0.08846887948834664	-0.08055039021370196	-0.055828320129854114	0.031839208639198605	0.1173227299541866	0.26468210747344345	0.34235347550708833	0.37850998396823377	0.4590779214482137	0.8462280640381927	1.0010624208809582	1.277601881771327	1.7935185835758223	3.2879136492273484	
A family moves into a old house in Japan. But there's a catch it's haunted (BOO!!!). Aw, didn't mean to make you jump. It's only a review. Settle back down. Ahem, now anyways it's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife & her lover in slow motion. This naturally makes a 3 minutes scene stretch out to about 7 or 8. Horrid acting. Horrid story. But How bad can it be you ask? Well it was SO bad my brain started to melt & leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips. It was SO bad whenever Doug McClure came on-screen I prayed that i had flashbacks of Small Wonder (Yes, i know Doug was in "Out of this world" & not "small Wonder", but it's pretty much the same damn show, & i can hum the "small wonder" theme better) There are movies that are so bad they're good. this isn't one of those<br /><br />Where i saw it: Showtime Beyond<br /><br />My Grade: F-<br /><br />Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless,Susan George gets 2 love scenes ( one nude, one just topless)<br /><br />	-5.454448987854523	-2.1878994755048984	-1.601776826751406	-1.4688965017935904	-1.4570154135640008	-1.395518073235252	-1.065429646323923	-0.7067573213373411	-0.583257193970523	-0.5090683463052977	-0.4644149829555977	-0.09723005578899559	-0.00514550260099321	0.018976047880125857	0.1409307953021144	0.22526939595276943	0.42026359540568653	0.46699972333807505	0.5296089684192764	0.5644901155595774	0.7478562366748185	0.8801041939017976	1.8682892168453709	2.1769458737293106	5.185769202349725	
I have certainly not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests, which if you like that sort of thing is not bad, but this is a major departure and could almost be Cronenberg minus the bio-mechanical nightmarish stuff. Except it's in French with subtitles of course. A man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman lingers, wearing nothing. As they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman, in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. Still though, that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to Paris & his apartment. The man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this 'tower block', a huge apartment building referred to as the Black Tower, where others of her kind (for whom the 'no memory' things seems to be the least of their problems) are being held for some reason. Time and events march by in the movie, which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman, and she does manage to call Robert, the guy that picked her up in the first place, to come rescue her. The revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. In avoiding what seemed to be his "typical" formula, Rollin created, in this, what I feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. I like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.	-2.291602157727147	-1.9370545594343636	-1.7768596615790597	-1.740010159558897	-0.8302862283241443	-0.5747349726899253	-0.49016389888789724	-0.4527492424593125	-0.34330654558235446	-0.2161063715925719	-0.13190830271724663	-0.10963083631114179	-0.05319642804021686	0.020755539307561695	0.04956810325260309	0.25444887240379377	0.28755636864193557	0.31667008274178343	0.5902876122493389	0.7566030948760868	0.8745843089095308	1.5335533789727247	1.9761340835908223	2.055537015962335	3.617111564705314	
I don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. You got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? And they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? The script already has a hole in it the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot. It's absolutely horrendous and I don't even understand how I managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie. The end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you, and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever. They might as well have called this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo."	-3.2190840164085164	-1.6206013942880966	-1.456280373152687	-1.4057322720368226	-1.2575795887682715	-1.082442764255001	-1.0432536320274062	-0.24251070400871297	-0.15820323108166912	-0.05910698571583266	-0.026821730943730214	-0.016117656106303613	-0.008743699724423362	0.26183942961041085	0.3476291961548689	0.34772253814112175	0.40457346709519076	0.5531769564506905	0.5578876905486039	0.7579258448382995	0.7824096740840606	0.8839580589292738	1.1013716927602484	2.4341399183312156	4.432495897797784	
I love ghost stories and I will sit through a movie til it's end, even if I'm not really enjoying it. I rarely feel like I wasted my time... BUT, this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was horrible! <br /><br />It wasn't scary in the least bit. What is with the comic relief moments? The dialog was tedious. Acting inconsistent The movie was WAY too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open. (Like the birthday party)<br /><br />The only good think I can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done.<br /><br />I am curious about other adaptation, but until then, I will stick to reading about the story.	-3.5948527354070126	-2.2654899503991883	-2.235927598094137	-2.123549428080692	-1.981077368254058	-0.9971520125803003	-0.6736742204953213	-0.6008814230440254	-0.5817480326601367	-0.5668364546948496	-0.5659062725604462	-0.3350145255198686	-0.26813425800640395	-0.1849588743906541	0.03605152177892841	0.37034940010289064	0.4526681715437513	0.5954314768436433	0.6788798266397928	1.0531869447636448	1.100805338262701	1.1366871997517778	1.3600116918650038	2.815669510304789	4.540578127246983	
It's hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of junk, the show couldn't even hold a candle to cooking shows of the past, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in TV history, not since ainsley harriott has had a terrible cooking show host I've watched, at least ainsley harriott has some good moments and some style, this one has no style at all, she's terrible as host, the kitchen looks atrocious, the writing is horrible, the teleplay is over the top and the opening credits are so bad, it makes me sick. Now I Enjoy cooking shows that had a cool sense of style, but this has absolutely none of that<br /><br />This is one of the worst TV of the year.	-1.527051266109674	-1.2169297851859375	-1.1427430484068695	-1.086062543287537	-0.9414736400672439	-0.651069456985788	-0.5358942544656657	-0.47916553040775284	-0.4217355020019354	-0.4123106384683118	-0.31506870425017985	-0.3146410209735382	-0.30591362672245587	-0.17476642218462074	-0.0747382500789402	0.033289317621325976	0.3403369666537124	0.4168180496677912	0.46413401661084375	0.6174125056244244	0.6252161716367051	0.7124351877965421	0.8394153118436107	1.1714866537461592	1.5954946135044243	
oh well... its funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense,but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends,but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else.this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie,the suspense,the shock,and good characters. the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be,and he seemed to be the average angry "D" student able to outsmart only stupid people. and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called "victims"<br /><br />3/10 just expect this one in the daily funnies.	-2.4521547045561647	-1.3509391715697865	-1.303534896642827	-1.263270956358617	-1.178494027725049	-0.9325086349409245	-0.7813619649295043	-0.6466041381656428	-0.37596213872556467	-0.24301106117781615	-0.2043758698389177	-0.19702812857098853	-0.18534326318717664	-0.06493682561695241	-0.06044801041883071	0.00321651664293221	0.18767218308264838	0.2823355302031967	0.4290315206100102	0.5207613294689674	0.6757404233511897	0.7520767447958908	1.2257360372058594	1.7305873240687324	3.166126047003625	
Most people who chase after movies featuring Audrey Tautou seem to not understand that Amelie was a character - it is not really Audrey Tautou's real life personality, hence, every movie she partakes in is not going to be Amelie part 2, part 3, etc.<br /><br />Now with that said, I too picked up this movie simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it's true, there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min, but I didn't even miss her because I was having so much fun with the other characters. The guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss, actually.... getting into all the characters here could take quite a while, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou's character Irene is not the overdone sugary girl that Amelie was. In fact, as Irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first. In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but over the course of a (very awful) day, her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic.<br /><br />What makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building... very entertaining to watch, great scenery and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all of the characters can actually act. The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left.... this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blossoms. I swear, it was the best 20 minutes of film I've seen in quite a while, and the ending.... It made me think "damn I really lucked out finding this movie". The ending to this movie is top notch. Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are there all these other subplots going on, but to somehow make them all tie in together (and in a sensible manner, which is the case here) but also to make each character feel human and come alive, not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect... very impressive.<br /><br />I highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone.	-2.3565704641999163	-1.9528372960891043	-1.7804449712994315	-1.6832814646161156	-1.5853762456472074	-1.5255062456690132	-0.9583332202234405	-0.36275860065305837	-0.22140194552308148	-0.16014765407799078	-0.11292577489361562	0.09590686922607342	0.103366813408867	0.1309339822100731	0.139822178936197	0.45108313851710646	0.5652874092022766	0.6423398410159746	0.8345841005987753	0.8580958716197327	2.089420400173784	2.371253629837639	2.46555612491999	3.2672710532577756	4.746926247277513	
I've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and this is among the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll. If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you ("let's check out the basement!"), then this is your show. Except, it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying.<br /><br />The extent of the virus is never, ever showed. I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only, as the resulting situation is very, very frightening. But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home, and ultimately dies at his hands. The woman flees north, and runs into a few tens situations. Then, some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her (things that make you go HUH?). Or something. Then, she is huddling for warmth. The end.<br /><br />Awful. These directors are mailing this tripe in.	-5.557561484984543	-3.4811331151228204	-2.2156428368232968	-2.1120639724054846	-2.038768580871069	-1.7787984239146226	-1.4438829534519453	-0.6389286448571588	-0.18367745427091056	-0.17838415600745805	-0.13509192430425176	-0.11113542007273357	-0.024487233652534607	0.004990386966037267	0.06907931109722563	0.12676615605686523	0.27669883481986157	0.31551642040447214	0.36535311597168507	0.4424043046019084	0.5819563342192848	0.8434899032162531	2.3733567535985287	2.5443810058075504	5.894480773767535	
If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it's this pile of crap. I love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity. I actually began to feel angry watching this film because it's so insultingly poor, I can't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable.<br /><br />There's no plot and the non-plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking. The people don't react, act or in any way resemble human beings. The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be. The whole thing is one pointless mess, it doesn't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don't do very much.<br /><br />I could make a better film than this, so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before. It's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />Honestly, the very worst movie of all time. You'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and urge you to BUY the DVD. I can't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film, it's terrible.<br /><br />0/10 and that's generous.	-7.9470775751204075	-5.089307697848791	-4.616227522481656	-4.191329438713403	-3.601538084070172	-2.3703452223960175	-2.035325281009579	-1.6462859695844243	-0.9399774793588161	-0.48899731470421415	-0.40679228724003347	-0.4020435600005352	-0.16903208600557332	-0.11846459315359345	0.20602219853846498	0.23321156263648501	0.3637422928517992	0.41747490724297837	0.8665961754789187	1.184620547617813	1.5198540933005702	1.7093849254327889	2.8179325996826177	4.851066835481393	8.549410137963863	
I've spent years looking for a copy of this film(16mm,dvd,vhs), so I could show it to my kids. The movie is funny, and Spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be that good to play that demented. I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages.<br /><br />The movie is about a turn of the century firehouse, with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band (when not fighting the fires).

in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon. i was 23, and had been married for a little over three years, and was beginning to come out as a lesbian. i saw this movie on an old black and white TV, with terrible reception, alone, and uninterrupted, in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story. i was living in a small house in tucson arizona, and it was summertime... like everyone else here, i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth, and its residue of fragile magic, and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday. i'll keep checking in. i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel's 'the other side of venus'. it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy...	-2.6814962698284273	-1.7834276125694497	-1.5910884541338846	-1.4262953844551405	-1.1640882523223446	-0.5121129741695802	-0.38838678986259995	-0.2545334499124118	-0.21463200537876967	-0.17334175324632473	-0.12893494789339294	-0.09426275446716963	-0.02740871868541249	-0.004766666359449084	0.03711917325664062	0.20202603280693862	0.22692235779864944	0.3635955404775709	0.36842878375656	0.4453039183156905	0.4612995094484609	0.5212307924902355	0.9236392938851532	1.7051226322702573	3.2596028403929673	
Not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart.<br /><br />I read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered. I felt Cuba Gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike Sean Penn's drooling fool portrayal in "I am Sam."<br /><br />The fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming. Sports are taken seriously in small town high school America (and elsewhere, I suspect) and I felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true, at least for me.<br /><br />The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under Radio's loving and open ways. Very well done to all. 7 out of 10.<br /><br />Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!	-1.5846519630750842	-1.39011707295703	-0.9825099575015697	-0.8605756394713022	-0.7368008204168401	-0.4860298751204994	-0.22897508258926935	-0.21944421145632728	-0.2010583303026616	-0.1874125044603189	-0.18693281283414462	-0.06102964289690591	0.15513150292208183	0.2767111747392032	0.27986968963368497	0.3553131786680275	0.4310590014138594	0.4455678576591653	0.5011163408769812	1.0264174875645686	1.1680648696894411	1.1745127144459389	1.2770275148546977	1.2953712040464593	1.8609435120508364	
It's 1978, and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well! Fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy there are so many black players on the field! This made for TV Super Bowl movie is watchable. It's not much more, but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance (for the time), probably most notably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately any goodness Selleck brings to the screen, is quickly trumped by "actors" like Dick Butkus.<br /><br />It's a silly story about super bowl betting. PJ Jackson is charged by "New York" (read mafia) for ensuring the game ends for their favor, in this case a $10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent enough, and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, the unsuspected Lainie, takes charge. For a while, the mystery of murders isn't known for certain, but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist.<br /><br />It's a bad movie, but is watchable. The acting is decent, and the filming is OK. At least there weren't any silly typical 70s car chases (they have their place just not here). Just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you'll survive.<br /><br />2/10 (maybe a 2.5)	-2.5293922870800927	-2.2957664841651053	-1.9904886606845928	-1.6503907893285625	-1.4248655418135006	-0.937861487194821	-0.23081460764025263	-0.17156402119023842	-0.07383787407329179	0.05877048397598673	0.15090340020626664	0.15912458924056005	0.2305547360544254	0.23485289807999818	0.2557501034729234	0.3332166727190572	0.4089193224775695	0.5647107520651674	0.8158888221328076	0.9760319312045277	1.9443600441372406	2.7057743954066935	2.7635907019189356	3.041934129049085	4.653508880346367	
As an impressionable 10 year old, I liked the "love conquers all" philosophy of the 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie." I did understand the controversy, which was about the romantic complications between a Jewish cab driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have issues with the young couple's interfaith marriage.<br /><br />Looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences, I am amazed that the show was even a success for one, albeit, highly-rated season. Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after the show's cancellation would write the successful play "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight.<br /><br />There was no denying the real-life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But, in later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his short-lived role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here, they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge, which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject.<br /><br />The show aired Saturday nights between two CBS powerhouses: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of those shows were smart, funny and had enough of an edge (more so on the former that the latter) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles.<br /><br />This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered.	-3.8513249974591313	-1.838925871130823	-1.6346224091539026	-1.5860080508447647	-1.3025230778457408	-1.0398233572222062	-1.024736619688033	-0.519338839183069	-0.029530079063596153	0.044833033856819075	0.16725040574949251	0.1747102542390603	0.18273769186593353	0.20438130013340075	0.2098641934198694	0.4163872624479823	0.42652658624236217	0.627237412026167	0.6397619848376453	0.6793706456301246	0.7100895968882627	1.2580679691634047	1.5015186448213098	2.3637396010194065	5.156167138908042

Errol Flynn at his best as Robin Hood of the West, fighting military red tape, confederates , indians and carpetbagger business crooks singlehanded to his great and final heroic end. Not to forget the ever reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the west. Never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons, it doesn't work out. Just enjoy it, because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn co-worked.	-0.8664002346456692	-0.6163870272774945	-0.4746018633185791	-0.34055459377894837	-0.23996299688503436	-0.17596220184084288	-0.16333702685881674	-0.16047788096669846	-0.07733091980846757	-0.05729526334633861	-0.0388964735159308	-0.036410313830874036	0.009324579957814359	0.038784990129190164	0.11415764258352476	0.1294005402591384	0.1419788623753832	0.19868087386734234	0.23494254879041834	0.2554008245242403	0.3311241682424169	0.3496777912534115	0.5383950589581423	0.9125001370530049	0.9806313314894748	
well, the writing was very sloppy, the directing was sloppier, and the editing made it worse (at least i hope it was the editing). the acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. pretty much none of the characters were likable. at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential. it was a great idea, but yet another wasted good idea goes by. it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending. and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter. the ending was not worth watching at all. sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. the movie looked rushed also. the movie just wasn't really worth seeing, and had i paid for it i would have been very mad. maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one. the movie over all was not horrifibly bad, but i wouldn't reccomend it. i gave it 2 out of 10 b/c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character (justin i believe, the super smart one). and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes. it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not pretty. anyway, if you see it, wait for the $1.50 theater or video, unless you like pretty much every movie you see, then i guess you'll like this one.	-10.635054591161662	-4.822457890408326	-4.462897864339926	-4.42668993446468	-4.166795969238409	-3.5707844726598443	-2.6795737113740383	-0.8306122271943754	-0.5968008426440887	-0.4969298455941888	-0.3910398672159407	-0.34148570374927173	0.07353991865967109	0.07993110726756529	0.1915304976159075	0.35003419001057856	0.4618766821180484	0.5124888957695797	1.0577141546485112	1.2912028896252699	1.523592600422597	1.5315168675826933	4.648145290170225	5.5998117533355565	11.296538134776707	
I saw this movie at a drive-in in 1959. Until "Howard the Duck" I considered this the worst movie I had ever seen. This movie tried to combine all the genera in one; comedy, horror, teenage angst, and the hot rod that must have sired "My Mother, The Car." Maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it's time.	-1.5938317885118338	-1.097337631352977	-0.7966477739117457	-0.7149748048840077	-0.6575872734466071	-0.5730876636408042	-0.48003403942502626	-0.4119153972436149	-0.1487202241932495	-0.054106033828325156	0.015931366143143267	0.03394872326048036	0.06461578618275958	0.12766174955414886	0.1439195792937693	0.14917074705997257	0.15140171392363933	0.20619815757629023	0.21491471722407335	0.31429958637921146	0.347046269837441	0.4198416822842719	0.7444276526894997	0.9954533270014643	1.943076381506291	
i totally loved this movie, tried to buy it and can't find it. a must see, a movie you can watch again and again, funny but also a tear jerker in one. really good album for the movie. it's a really good 80's movie, i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie, cause i would,the actors in it acted really good.there's a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie.that's what makes this movie so good. so go out and try to rent this one, you won't regret it. it's an older movie but it's worth watching, i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon, but i'm sure it would not be the same. anyone who hasn't seen it, go rent it.	-2.139295899603899	-1.5812413188111512	-1.0319922020815342	-0.7437717744053374	-0.6136077918634137	-0.2078042291221391	-0.17734870865077323	-0.07558237850265301	0.03426763995561601	0.053157441946345176	0.06985308616948574	0.22139856225877041	0.40089214797473904	0.4850867742636379	0.5261997631948581	0.5360927175831087	0.5935314165865311	0.6799440155233706	0.7668270521856859	1.089253187346536	1.305528683829749	1.479146124229736	1.7427349132661638	2.2433003546590866	2.353897739409073	
Although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational, still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from Andy Warhol to make his cimematic productions more marketable and viewer-friendly. In any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing Joe buck naked (almost all the time!). And the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half-way. This would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler, instead of letting the actors make up some nonesensical plot and dialog of their own.	-2.2491061016679788	-2.168095360787611	-1.023021640282759	-0.6210834681196822	-0.4244192638610377	-0.3771090743844144	-0.2315768691050831	-0.1248996551062738	-0.07892642009893101	-0.0722831690558829	-0.044377877562227566	-0.026255593298291253	-0.002930336072623614	0.046520385843711376	0.05396051992781598	0.11178824097089642	0.1963621283420396	0.22713873414025731	0.4486892620289871	0.46265045294659657	0.5604167833578164	0.6154627325163121	0.9303448255074029	1.3311455561274619	2.412497952317969	
When the word "presents" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However, I've always been willing to give the second installment of the Demons trilogy a try. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another, well, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course, she was eleven when this film was made, and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early Helen Mirren: steamy looks and little clothing.) As well, Lamberto Bava comes from one of Italy's finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as Giallo (he's the son of Mario Bava, who may well have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original Demons is an absolute must-see for fans of eighties B-horror films. So how bad can this be, right? Well, bad. The demons continue their assault on Italian media, as the movie opens in a modern Italian high-rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background. They're all watching a kind of combination news report/mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film (which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film). Through the usual horror-film extra inability to concentrate, the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he comes through the TV screen to start the plague anew.<br /><br />Yeah. It's that bad. About the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack (when you're not being buffeted about by the likes of The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is stunning. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who got his start as a part of the Argento Dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as Lord of Illusions and Hackers.<br /><br />Makes a half-decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily, but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was. Cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty-creature romp, Shivers (aka They Came From Within), is a whole lot better.	-3.8710241133745185	-3.701959499697075	-3.0511808750453158	-2.760833903682607	-1.4149081075426215	-1.2107416132918802	-1.1225983937147506	-0.6181810601435407	-0.5959272895047966	-0.5852326120625577	-0.5024738906445205	0.07695104706257844	0.23129020072850986	0.3456135389928278	0.6469492457914696	0.6527322055073934	0.8177778550486701	0.8241698955988248	1.0131085610406008	1.1288650316526019	1.698975978110769	1.9577572815012194	3.737036711777877	4.150570858299971	7.05038624741374	
This movie is the first of the six infamous Guinea Pig Movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways. A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and it includes a manga video, showing the torture. The men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die. Some scenes are shocking, such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times, because you see punches in nearly every movie. This movie has a lot of gore so I would recommend this to people 17 or older.<br /><br />9/10	-2.5027831689089646	-1.7028039388971987	-1.5516004195503554	-1.5121846108728283	-0.8310210217686874	-0.80085489963569	-0.6496044471345588	-0.4575176552366129	-0.41363630965097414	-0.22581717965911013	-0.14566337462354445	0.06203814734107607	0.0928892235177848	0.1186453919984713	0.12592265166536612	0.22681681489550984	0.39236556358428454	0.5509256094223068	0.5905659836454604	0.6622289653526392	0.6974458793267511	1.2444080089271363	1.628671507316222	2.3178209829392333	3.8440014620539675	
I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve to. Before this film, I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. There's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. <br /><br />This is one I'd recommend to anyone.	-4.067251536191032	-2.859358554390019	-1.564881706980962	-1.5303892443371596	-1.0137176355471573	-0.2088812948777057	-0.16098674395882825	0.06560038191553821	0.08759733174174479	0.10127165469291725	0.15779871175365595	0.34731639539109915	0.7132112479179042	0.9927416301737272	1.0733892334845196	1.220594810752707	1.4969513118485984	1.5044169992794731	1.9888555965913906	2.353480457154102	2.3576134959162007	2.82018727630222	3.1443437045490836	3.603189820561348	4.433148455242105	
Lead actor Yuko Tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative "The Milkwoman," a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50-something woman, charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives. Played out in the picturesque, tranquil town of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is less a straight-out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for.<br /><br />Perfectly embodying the requisite world-weariness subjected to a spiritless routine, Tanaka plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her work shift at a supermarket, takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then.<br /><br />Opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young Minako vowing never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does as such with the narrative, patiently sticking with Minako as he, deftly aided by Tanako's understated yet highly effective performance, follows her -- whether she's having chitchat with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) on being single, or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk -- as she and Kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years. Such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast-paced narratives but for the rest, it's a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically.	-2.47490804084717	-1.8849223415134673	-1.819839496924418	-1.685466750535371	-1.057009626512842	-0.4947233063989034	-0.3706689778020869	-0.33256664451008744	-0.2237149378987839	-0.21116217826400044	-0.14527751749291812	-0.07384368426207094	-0.019624551921933825	0.031007408769301026	0.06567925379069496	0.17185804923652848	0.42457197699559557	0.4586538583876639	0.47816777627894763	0.6116359234504094	0.7456435335269287	0.9142406416240072	1.1614965084887805	1.7438447429846924	3.25942492107893	
I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film. While I am not at all a fan of British drama, I did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made. I was in tears by the end of the film. Every scene was mesmerizing. The attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive.<br /><br />I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character.<br /><br />*******SPOLIER ALERT******** I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance! ****END SPOILER*****<br /><br />Keira Knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly Oscar worthy.<br /><br />I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards.	-2.0512619995557304	-1.9484660420067113	-1.6876960124310842	-1.0400936502777103	-0.6624423103555497	-0.4837585984544081	-0.480386385626716	-0.24365301327156094	0.03518315436897263	0.052663494110290865	0.07002407685631624	0.11168789482707357	0.2040324390216439	0.25476598001782647	0.5610327626714051	0.6178369685506354	0.6543491639697087	0.7666087114348316	0.8637914110239708	0.8784745886476887	1.0114202452099617	1.192411069499788	2.296358158409546	2.5928866222807563	3.3986924409207977	
I am very open minded. I watch all kinds of programs to the end...good or bad...just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones. This show had potential to be good. But my god, what were the writers, casting director, and director thinking? The cast of actors are terrible...with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot.<br /><br />The rest of the cast kill the show. It is the same story line in every episode. Sam has plans to do something. His boss disrupts these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects. Then the foolish ways Sam tries to accommodate both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor. This is EVERY episode. It gets very tiring.<br /><br />Season 2, they ditch the eye candy. The 2 "hot" girls in the show get written out (yet the brother stays? explain that casting cut to me please). I can see why they wrote them out...they had no substantial role...but they didn't add anyone better to replace them.<br /><br />The cocky Derek Tricolli character is given a continuous appearance in season 2. His acting (along with everyone else's) resembles many poor sitcoms from the 80's...might have been funny then...but painful now.<br /><br />the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to execute them. This show lacks everything. Production quality is the only good aspect of the show. It is great in that regard...unfortunately the content is painfully sad.<br /><br />My god. FOX, was there really nothing better to choose from? I'm sticking with shows like "It's always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" for now. The bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and aren't continually drooling on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe.	-9.039702073412867	-4.169393328345937	-3.5560942633873753	-3.4844536928692937	-2.7240665883704542	-2.405854311141835	-1.9709505899269355	-0.8156226809188164	-0.7711246659351381	-0.6251210251269471	-0.6156247154568335	0.002062648338660683	0.3783105147534679	0.552523504076623	0.561502769110527	0.6070185801168425	0.9618374277372832	0.9729079298266209	1.2559175220917083	1.7636858330407947	2.155733403529097	2.1912437464561636	2.4046034478423066	5.048857406242108	10.220126696708268	
In this tense and character-driven romantic tragi-comedy, we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething Parisians. At the centre is Vinz Cassell's portrayal of Max. A starry-eyed Romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his put-upon best friend Lucien (Écoffey, in an understated but effective performance), he wins her heart and they live happily ever after... that is, until the scheming, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three.<br /><br />The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble, and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw, the eye-candy of picture-postcard Paris at the heart of it all. The use of colour does not go unnoticed, particularly in Lisa's spectacular apartment (presumably accounting for the film's title), where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust.<br /><br />The audience can relate to Max: he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it. In one memorable scene, our fated lovers (agonisingly separated by a 'choreographed' misunderstanding) narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them. Independent of one another, they travel to the same destination: her on the Metro, him in a taxi, practically tête-à-tête. Yet fate seems to have it in for them, and the audience is captivatingly teased.<br /><br />The performances in this film are really what make L'Appartement stand out. I still cannot understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real-life spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the Anglophone film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic 'leading-lady' style, which many British and American actresses dismiss in favour of the all-too-easy 'subtle' approach.<br /><br />All in all, watch this film! I doubt you'll be disappointed. It is gripping, satisfying, amusing, sad, lavish, and a lesson in artistic film-making.	-3.166544830390504	-3.148005748047663	-2.7522173991777925	-2.7416556491227744	-1.6432821744799835	-1.3287183779997631	-1.0921372616335216	-0.850946399033356	-0.4717561726630681	0.03022926047822176	0.05343688313584566	0.18566551900046008	0.3398549285642166	0.3498481016567514	0.5120213356878134	0.5766334849490772	0.6528502858165373	0.7656628314329641	0.7698266928665369	1.375845660808926	1.5843400952964213	2.010923293180765	3.7208271207989707	4.066426272503819	7.45688585264366	
Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? Firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. At one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as "a gherkin in a burger". I would be laughing if I was making it up-BUT I'M NOT! Just as ludicrous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. A cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid. WHAT????????<br /><br />Secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. This may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark, broad daylight. Not very atmospheric at all.<br /><br />Thirdly the acting is truly awful, Pinion proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable. Jeff Fahey is obviously on auto-pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a woe-ful Humphry Bogart impersonation as Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We get the joke it just isn't funny). Credit should go to Susan Paterno, an actress I was not aware of, she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other, more experienced actors to shame.<br /><br />At no point is it even explained how the HUMAN character can understand what Van Husen's character is saying to her. She obviously has some sort of degree in screwy alien languages.<br /><br />On the plus side one moment is well done, the car crash involving Susan. The sfx are throughly believable and if it weren't for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been applauded.<br /><br />All I can say about darkhunters is that British horror will never recover from its interminable slump if movies like this continue to be made and shown. Avoid this movie like the plague, although the plague would be a lot more scary.<br /><br />Darkhunters 0/5<br /><br />p.s. the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious. It is a weak defence when some claim "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". The letters after my name make a fool of you not me.	-11.648989583232423	-5.501630130785687	-4.811214401065576	-4.618627116423461	-4.473903941051086	-2.865187775067984	-2.5356703581754076	-1.7942322300979823	-0.51577085448706	-0.5054004350802033	-0.48854178632618583	-0.44352516210102566	0.07692789722442009	0.2131166866143553	0.3744660416567032	0.701649087130459	1.0772797116725548	1.2026564364990264	1.2721152895738246	1.564363260265212	1.6354616687586794	2.0520669309537083	4.263597566352092	5.466452507331197	12.463780331345664	
Hm. Where do I start? I usually ignore whatever rating IMDb has when looking up a movie because I think I might like it anyway or whatever and I should at least give it a chance, but this time I wish I'd paid attention.<br /><br />I know some people liked it, and I'm not trying to say that they shouldn't. It was semi-amusing at some parts. But if you're like me and you don't like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random fast motion cloud scenes, dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to 'thrilling' music, and close-ups of faces while people are speaking, then you might want to avoid this movie. The actors were either positively wooden or way over the top, and the film quality was awful, fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all. And I know that we were supposed to think that Carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on, but... well, she doesn't really convince me otherwise. In fact, I ended up really disliking her crazy character. And what was up with the souls in space? I understand this is a fantasy movie, but come on.<br /><br />I will say, the angel at the end was freaking creepy. It was the creepiest thing in the whole movie, WAY more creepy than the Darth Maul lava-face demon. I give them props for that scene, it was good. But not good enough to actually see the movie. And the opening credits were great, but don't be fooled! I would've rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better.<br /><br />Bah. I wish I hadn't bought this for even the $2 that I paid for it, I could have bought a candy bar instead. :/	-6.527180045145966	-3.8028916166933198	-3.359628080607849	-2.6503208099073055	-2.4503063469170496	-2.3398715488834045	-2.1944484168708884	-1.1711351692035916	-0.47047470419699766	-0.4531937973976383	-0.40424221595970095	-0.20980870198461252	-0.09976181878599548	0.09974614116648728	0.1265196591383426	0.39224505610247223	0.44901087410420243	1.0458980482012457	1.1271096384347163	1.4348410785832064	1.4888923246965204	1.7483118961192285	2.123523554805076	3.932673198786988	7.49543212916884	
One of the worst films I have ever seen! After watching it i walk out like, what happened? I am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. First,I can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.Because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! This movie isn't scary at all! There is even no Typical horror clichés,too. The plot and acting of This movie was terrible. It's not,fantastic,surrealistic or horror,It's just hideously bad Turkish feature film.And finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters.

Significant Spoilers! <br /><br />This is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.<br /><br />I do know that I will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sick, twisted, foul-mouthed, foul-thinking deviant. She looks, speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs, who spent 20 years doing hard time. You can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the DVD special features section of "Surveillance: The Watched are Watching." You can see and hear her for yourself. She was every bit as bad as I had envisioned from the writing of this movie.<br /><br />I'm not shocked by bad language, although this director certainly talks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any p0rn film. The level of implied sado-violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards. This perverse, disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was seeking. This is a snuff film.<br /><br />Be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending. This director/writer is truly a sick person. I can't believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie, much less pay her for it. You can be assured that I will never, ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with. In the thousands of movies I have watched and collected, there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott. She is offensive beyond anyone I have ever seen connected with filming a movie before. There have been some bad directors and writers, but none could compare to her sick, twisted mind.<br /><br />When I saw this movie, which was just one murder rampage after another. Once it got past the hotel murder... then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks... the vacation family with the bad parents (who had no business being in the presence of children)... followed by the drug addicts.... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers.<br /><br />As I saw the serial killers reveal themselves, I began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie. Those were my actual thoughts as I watched this movie. I fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind... because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose. On the DVD, she was indeed the sick, twisted person I had envisioned writing such a disturbing film.<br /><br />While the little girl, (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, truly stole the show... I can't believe that her real-life parents would have tolerated this sick, foul-mouthed, director to be anywhere near their daughter.<br /><br />This movie is disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility.<br /><br />As far as the ending of the movie goes... the alternate ending, should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal. There was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character. I'm stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer. That trailer is not representative of the movie you will see.<br /><br />Other than the child... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you watch it carefully, even the parents of the vacationing family; the sick cops taking pot shots; the serial killers posing in alternate roles; cops in the station; and even the station dispatcher... every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually, twisted, violent pervert. I'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the Canadian town in the Special Features section of the DVD.<br /><br />This writer-director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes, every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps. The only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Watch closely and you will see this in every character. Then listen to the director-writer talk on the DVD Special Features section and you will understand what I'm telling you about her mental state and psychological issues. She wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a Hollywood film making family.<br /><br />Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much of a filmography... less than a handful of things. Since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles, I don't think we'll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad, director David Lynch helps her out. I'd recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with... and I'm not too sure her dad's films would be any better.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.	-25.594600815033115	-13.023847765523392	-11.318902716250982	-11.18910340452846	-9.329304961923023	-8.179283494530427	-7.103437528289065	-2.0578942333060533	-2.0034864766339857	-0.8119810253505277	-0.7678003140088728	-0.7105086243922151	-0.4380327209590502	-0.10828923724978179	1.8885155587598113	1.9473209308786015	2.6748395577544763	2.8105618440692215	3.0476822619561275	3.5374104785184164	3.5934652465661374	4.520373770020348	8.558249137761074	14.181116199999286	27.962631549985034	
I just can't understand the negative comments about this film. Yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by. Henstridge (talk about winning the gene-pool lottery!) is as magnetic and alluring as ever (who says the golden age of cinema is dead?) and Vartan holds his own.<br /><br />There is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! It is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together...<br /><br />Ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue, watch this flick, you will feel so much better. If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric.<br /><br />(PS: I am 33, Male, from the UK and a hopeless romantic still searching for his Princess...)	-2.0289420429549736	-1.5232735465201546	-1.2023992607706258	-0.941515600132147	-0.9217612359474014	-0.5323931500449519	-0.5127737697047341	-0.36056622692347406	-0.3279217207848751	-0.10596463576786548	-0.07917906324846176	0.019387616259012544	0.024978974065997167	0.07524656048313692	0.1362465930869065	0.19747217918989407	0.3070672392690437	0.6880943517092868	0.7967219327889753	0.8757013334602429	1.2755182501985651	1.5353552934342973	1.9110321503369179	2.307398200834152	2.4236749994141236	
If ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is Galaxina. What could possibly be wrong in basing a sci-fi film around a sexy statuesque female android? Surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? Well, sadly this movie is pretty close to useless. There are a number of faults with this production it has to be said, however, there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise. Firstly, this is a comedy with no funny bits at all, or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. Secondly, the title character is woefully underused. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film. I don't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. Anyway, what we are left with is a whole lot of mind-numbing comedy relief, which often is made up of hopeless spoof-type gags of the big sci-fi hits of the time such as Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It's badly written and not funny at all, and it doesn't even really have a plot to propel things along. The story basically is about a police space-cruiser that is sent to get a rock. That's it! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence. What he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - pointless maybe?<br /><br />This seemed like a sure-fire winner to me but it failed miserably. It seems to have been an attempt to spoof Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should've been. A Barbarella for the 80's this ain't.<br /><br />Shortly after this film was finished Dorothy Stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way. And for that reason Galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it's cult interest. I just think it's a great shame that Dorothy didn't have a better film left to immortalise her.	-9.770563685660532	-4.669603326415864	-4.60765741884559	-4.115609250658496	-3.9688401087089393	-3.4954440176718258	-3.4034224729184235	-1.351575516819343	-0.8317603376369542	-0.6134041248968064	-0.391647020848565	-0.052264744069681054	0.03249540984731127	0.27823610805336846	0.6433963826135162	0.7023941596503428	0.7644896799835488	0.9011144501280222	1.241130111194981	1.4751141466777586	1.6875049438938576	1.7931661446829603	4.430051181936302	5.328518506096784	11.908574149070686	
Yes its an art... to successfully make a slow paced thriller.<br /><br />The story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening.<br /><br />Fine performance by Robin Williams. The sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film. However, the core plot is very engaging. The movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering. The direction is good. Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.<br /><br />Very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story!	-2.6168735544895103	-1.4760243952112844	-1.3044323575973764	-1.1809491872383895	-0.6103514347810027	-0.35291329443155595	-0.29886002568634706	-0.1251673638854508	-0.11600124599686908	0.1659522704796158	0.19752832437215992	0.30332659132074324	0.4595971611462878	0.6379510945412079	0.6498466975999144	0.6556808009732283	0.7033933599175991	0.8889633970034844	0.9306917363901712	0.966866252096332	1.025917958272042	1.095133296682635	1.7986277482242214	1.8122681294994614	2.8585212350656364	
When I watched this movie in my adolescence, I attempted for the soundtrack. Some bands of the soundtrack I still didn't know. However, during the film, I already noticed her quality. U2, Blondie, Police. , Quincy Jones , Commodores .Sensational soundtrack.<br /><br />In Brazil, there is a long time this film didn't pass in TV. Today, he passed in cable TV and I remembered to access the site to do the comment.<br /><br />The End of the film surprised me a lot, but it is what happens in the real life. Not always, what thought about being the ideal, it is what happens. <br /><br />The life brings us a lot of surprises.	-2.774437688194233	-1.8574966557418908	-0.9701314447013591	-0.9090112222459195	-0.8850437093767073	-0.5366473402258869	-0.4551639499160316	-0.38767385504178803	-0.36522664626149187	-0.28338714046776553	-0.20276626796216018	-0.17513971864172503	-0.02153766409347435	0.05414754588175135	0.2597113190373694	0.26513773932721596	0.3755487878697157	0.5192963132827072	0.7593743823021811	0.8503660015705835	0.8945324569911486	1.0309927301079909	1.065204522495534	1.6574510670312712	3.39024675971804	
The fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie. The story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out. In one moment you think that something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well it does, but certainly not what you'd expect.<br /><br />The film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr. are some of their best in my opinion. The ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well I guess that was what Michael Tollin & Mike Rich were trying to do.

Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it's not without trying...Actually, it is. It's a shamble all the more because it's writer/director/technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. Sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their "patients" with crazy group scare tactics, psychological mind-f*** sessions that could go on for days, and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most Nazis cringe, escaped finally when he was 15. I'm glad he got out, though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film-making skills, if only for a couple of days, to learn things like, say, structure, proper lighting, fluid camera movement, subtlety with actors, and other basics that are perpetually lost here.<br /><br />It's all the more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public (there was recently a Newsweek article referring to a similar AA cult-rehab). Many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas. This is an ever-nagging sensation throughout Over the GW, where it almost feels like Gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn't know how to communicate it properly through his characters. The character that one would think is closest to him, Bronx teen Tony Serra (Gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey, would be closest to Gaglia, is actually much more of a one-dimensional being, where there is very little back-story (we see a brief freak-out, in black and white, in his old home) and little connection to his mother (Moriarty), who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another. But there is a story to go with his two-year crisis, I guess.<br /><br />Right off the bat things get rough (a nude cavity search in the first five minutes), and soon it's clear that instead of medical care it's more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect, where the head doctor Hiller (Insinnia) is a total over-controlling loon. But soon Tony's sister Sofia (Donohue) gets thrown in to the program, and as opposed to Tony's repeated moments of outrage and supposed non-compliance, she goes head-on through the whacked-out three step program and once released becoming a runaway. At times there are bits in this fractured nightmare, where there's one woman, a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she's become a prisoner not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them, that do contain some raw power, very brief glimpses of Gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama.<br /><br />But these are moments few and far between. It's not just the unsuccessful characters, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical D.A.R.E. rip-offs (maybe some of them, like an angry black youth, the passive-aggressive counselors, or even Serra's older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program, would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them). It's that Gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny $30,000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through. He over-uses tints, mostly with a shade that looks urine-coated), he jiggles his hand-held DVX camera as if it's supposed to be intense ala City of God, occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly, his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there's even inane fake interview scenes with Nicholas Serra (inspiration ?) and Krakowsky that feel about as false as possible.<br /><br />Could Gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would-be artistically cathartic plan B? Bottom line, no matter how much from-the-heart true life stories may appeal to you, don't bother seeing it in the theater, or even on rental, unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital-hued Hudson river sunset with the final words reading: Dedicated to the Kids.

I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (or is that Gen Y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his "wedding." Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The "joke" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "bits and pieces." Problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. And Kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking "Do I look fat?" I recognize the show was not made for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today. So let them laugh. Thank God the show was short-lived.	-4.795137071980143	-1.804350700173598	-1.7591970886587545	-1.409529454110106	-1.375358109879765	-1.115087619719653	-1.0703696959056304	-0.8887464373589795	-0.3840892363098879	-0.21078882359764806	-0.05126849304529021	0.049501608939862815	0.10214802414601978	0.29480315764817105	0.31548182548249176	0.45140391834422733	0.5279449452122577	0.6124320772694252	0.632165061994123	0.6877860009145484	0.7333766887267968	0.8168223550986304	1.9248416461157505	2.0981815216228146	5.012787000224965	
Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.	-2.7316690930583114	-1.4526709732550511	-1.0148793528773605	-0.9175078823849588	-0.7791023522780891	-0.7511519471710485	-0.7120139850017138	-0.6424533444945228	-0.6175430006566571	-0.3841576231773954	-0.28914275067957906	0.08349150634521138	0.12007530174131723	0.17250495799767587	0.17401598669272095	0.18107727786670974	0.2302189101369838	0.3526008156859426	0.4129463585281813	0.5012211141029654	0.7348970471868669	0.740899424142099	1.0585827136563957	1.2564890699605156	2.6803191727856293	
I love this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune into to watch tonight and I see for some reason you have retooled this great show. And you have taken what made it work and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love the other characters as well, but they are good in small dozes like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in. It is overdose. While things are funny in small dozes when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying. I was so looking forward to the return of this show. So please bring back the charm. Even if you could not fit Piper into the show at least bring Lizzy back. But I loved those girls. They brought the fun. The show was about Sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well. That was the charm. And that great dog as well.<br /><br />I hope the network (FOX) forced the writers to do this and the writers did not willingly do this to the show. I will give the show a couple more episodes before I give up, but tonight's episodes were bad. I made a big deal out of the show returning tonight and had people over and I felt like a fool, because no one was laughing except 2-3 times. I apologized to them and said I don't know what happened. And about 10 minutes into the episode I realized they were not going to show Piper or Lizzy and this was no longer a must see TV comedy.	-8.224807955960374	-3.6859230437524944	-3.589387759966649	-3.5780031278399638	-2.0162784741500515	-1.291452114009694	-1.124080806916415	-1.0379250173417838	-0.8426506796856723	-0.5544442812665608	0.005658422487898093	0.21930349550986283	0.384049733623749	0.4375236343734661	0.515464595232556	0.8914711880258365	1.4338151582935585	1.5013955599334017	1.8181660334732266	1.8201659553996723	2.1927465331775644	2.2948094627922107	5.616459234595765	6.1275614001607845	6.711112642738686	
Fritz Lang directed two great westerns: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". The Frank James movie equals "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of Randolph Scott's great westerns. I have never seen Robert Young in a western before; he is terrific as the telegraph employee. This is the only movie I can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west. It is a high-geared story about the telegraph in the west, a triangle love story, and about loyalty. <br /><br />The supporting cast is superb. Dean Jagger, who made a few westerns, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays Mr. Jagger's sister, is the love interest in the movie. Ms. Gilmore had a short career in movies. She quit films in 1952 and became a drama coach. She is primarily known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It is great to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott again. They were in two other great movies: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".	-3.9746691005874775	-3.4529354232324674	-1.3469373952334276	-1.1301221531578711	-1.0886663038130513	-0.44183839702566896	-0.2716231233226113	-0.15291172312302737	0.009293058251698169	0.30058338359056236	0.4835081381507622	0.573624650740837	0.7269912340772015	0.7772718006410935	0.7975738592945726	0.8131045677946915	0.922368806313241	1.2872599397468034	1.3241709911701685	1.6881564469443713	1.8225813230129737	1.8575138666062645	2.000990643746798	2.0135212993430547	4.463367250172823	
Like a lot of the comments above me, also I though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.<br /><br />But that is not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as I will explain a in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking. In the worst case, the other party is represented by one person.<br /><br />Also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters (I mean, from a point of the interviewed, 'akward'). Moreover the interview persons always stay calm, they say everything without normal emotions. I.e. you cannot tell whether they lie or not, are mad or not. They show almost nothing.<br /><br />This is also very unprofessional, the 'Christian' reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />All conversations contain:<br /><br />- facts<br /><br />- pro/con arguments<br /><br />There are no lies. Nobody lies. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you still plan to see the movie) The only lie happening is to demonstrate how 'bad' non-believers are.<br /><br />This makes me conclude that the movie is a B-movie. It is very similar to 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' (from the 50's), but this movie also has an annoying, wrong set discussion about aliens and Christian belief.<br /><br />NOTE: I have no intention to insult Christians, people who believe in aliens or whomever else. This is a thought I have about the movie, not about people.<br /><br />Moreover I would like to note that I don't know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts.	-10.32421566159587	-4.291612880742276	-4.25715658363674	-4.091938622700286	-3.878624052118217	-3.6500411912531217	-2.6638243361154057	-1.1487852299184127	-1.053975517383428	-0.9861737554733493	-0.6571146848773421	-0.41600120740818003	-0.14031073446298278	0.3006352554960539	0.43248717968973105	0.4917935953037759	0.648452683071502	1.1518542649101409	1.4455480281006718	1.4764153832699338	1.5435693988103822	2.322675865887266	4.461377352339762	4.73491588773942	11.525689718413583	
I can't praise this film enough. It had a lot of that hand-held, first-person shaking camera which I love (and some hate, because it makes them sick), like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />It is a long movie for its kind, but I didn't even notice because the film was so interesting. By just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter's work the movie keeps up the pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer.<br /><br />While I would never call this film the "scariest horror ever made", I'd have to say it's certainly one of the best I've seen. The fear factor here is constructed by details in the images, camera glitches, events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie. The horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imaginations. The ending is perfect, and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards. A second viewing is highly recommended, though.<br /><br />Watch this one alone in the dark, don't expect anything and you'll have fun.	-2.0661826035077033	-2.0293925565531326	-1.8746740308482763	-1.534060394785199	-0.8379392410113634	-0.6424117332856282	-0.6140394236712162	-0.4531054362322041	-0.389479626605638	-0.27613913544190444	-0.02894516504800515	0.18457707933218714	0.21384247776857981	0.24614778149397826	0.2607366999006055	0.3025359134632278	0.3422423949447716	0.7444043109441192	0.7870958351497874	0.902443522892946	1.1235005682833188	1.5912452870393339	2.306428112757369	3.0004000710409175	3.6205875115548656	
If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, more shallow than Britney, more vapid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, wonder no more. The amazing thing is Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. She's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic "popular" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to "parodies" of HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces. The younger boy is just another of the smart-mouth "wisecracking" brats who have multiplied on TV like cockroaches in New York (and with the same appeal). The dad is the stereotypical dumb TV dad, and the mom... well, she's not totally awful. But all pales beside the hideous, loathsome, and yet horribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) spectacle of Ms. Lopez' smug, self-satisfied, snotty performance . And, again, she's the HEROINE.	-5.275251934398084	-2.7388891110607587	-2.619878972563387	-2.608260052580973	-2.390280411764778	-2.295088162705378	-2.2614695511329335	-0.4028696403741781	-0.15123828669387282	-0.08422109199620394	-0.003995249419585928	0.062461722915766335	0.09829455142577159	0.10957429328704446	0.1701632495191581	0.29852410509337146	0.30330508185439686	0.32404422348881134	0.3403765472591494	0.656786018656681	0.9698185795705403	1.079050976967571	2.66811435370171	3.337730656612892	6.0653289972777005

David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `House of Games,' a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel, 'Driven.' Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability. When a patient, Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf. This takes her to the `House of Games,' a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world. Instead of the `twenty-five large' that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars. And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she'll agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room. In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the `tell' of one of the other players. By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked. The dialogue, and Mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing. As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a `tell' is and how it works, to the lessons of the `short con,' to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless. And nothing is what it seems. In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. She changes; and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation. Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does. Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, self-assured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated. She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey), Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer), J.T. Walsh (The Businessman), Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran). `House of Games' is the quintessential Mamet; he's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future. But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up. You'll find it under `Perfection.' This is one great movie you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.	-7.21900629569237	-6.58563710186449	-3.6822722577857587	-2.788717012375335	-2.6477566020929184	-0.4145119074197789	-0.23450921140739367	0.09604246762011334	0.22822409941314892	0.3535513571096603	0.6482483663499143	1.1490409443272542	1.5469018064867133	1.6229976424556047	1.7666354144838707	1.8361713490789446	1.8583377688088516	1.9641365209846073	2.4914209400660097	2.6879289315008226	2.852757220411283	2.9926836719100214	5.871352309008443	7.019399890320507	8.400162312002157	
I hate to admit it, but I didn't find it to be one of Hitchcock's best but nonetheless a riveting, climatic thriller. In a remake of Hitchock's 1934 movie of the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart)  the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) are holidaying in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot. The conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot: kidnapping their beloved Hank.<br /><br />I found it surprising that Doris Day, who I usually associate with Rock Hudson comedies, was cast in a Hitchcock film. As I was watching it, I soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to Hitchcock's other works (example: Psycho) and she had singing ability needed to pull off "Que Sera Sera", which she did beautifully. She was well cast as herself and James Stewart had chemistry, which helped make the couple believable.<br /><br />In comparison to the great director's other works I believe this isn't as good, but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller/mystery. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a smash hit for Doris Day. Well directed, well acted. A fine film.	-2.4924188353553296	-2.12556781375159	-1.8915636796469386	-1.6546286829021795	-0.9948035709046561	-0.892857204450796	-0.2840896247342721	-0.27431011507922276	-0.2058791415397167	-0.12504738925732212	0.061348823248538256	0.15535260140626503	0.36041286241428916	0.3909824809951474	0.40579981054634456	0.4846464971033797	0.5177234280562641	0.6153924654703476	0.8286074584035894	1.128330452851198	1.5301822645179053	1.7692034045570597	2.3830728665173586	3.178698876351683	3.27779846095821	
Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. He really seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how cliché, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.	-3.9335438994413874	-2.8683747080787874	-1.7875728260555122	-1.685330311933193	-1.5031997955486336	-0.39307691152372376	-0.36251225364840883	-0.24594691376124359	-0.03528587388215891	0.03931073915348786	0.6619777357848096	0.702218454717211	0.7262791232895441	0.7981565397295697	0.9174799764094833	0.9291187521200164	1.280095431599599	1.319425579205469	1.3540459921908736	1.3988695487545475	1.4870943627585098	1.6047993563754703	2.785983459367567	2.8346453990317992	4.026890130965227	
I've seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy. Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge.<br /><br />This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a T&A film.<br /><br />B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /><br />The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. Oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.<br /><br />(spoilers) You know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she doesn't write her book, she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. But hey, what more did you expect?<br /><br />Oh, and did you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned. I was really looking forward to those	-10.05995971591408	-4.881592459560571	-4.694518209615294	-4.444629790674087	-4.367639118256569	-2.890193119802608	-1.7407759086048236	-1.429808120537852	-1.2051722327155456	-0.969746157425885	-0.7819538698617486	-0.41131344478687615	-0.4023014217042487	-0.34561833567828243	-0.08206234244222418	0.22560351029200157	0.5758390363448531	0.5779484900928276	1.267831020024796	1.5348431620678054	2.2568449364607006	2.423486454365891	3.138794830998742	5.485553093267027	10.153018145498454	
This "movie" is such a bad work! Nothing seems to even try and be realistic. Plot is weak, acting - miserable, actors wondering around like in a 1st year production, trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort to all concerned including the audience. Well, as in any thriller, here too are murders, corpses and blood. Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago, committed a murder with a knife, and came out calm and smiling, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if slashing one's throat is done by a virtual agent. Also, this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male, and she cut his throat!!! Did she ask him, politely, to bend down for her? Much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one. Continuity is another huge problem as for instance: The eager-hungry groom is lying in bed, waiting for his virgin-bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while, falls asleep(!?!). Next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception-area, asking for guidance to scenery spots! NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT??? Such a waste of time even to try and write about this low-low supposed-to-be "movie".	-9.690876602785833	-4.662749969219647	-4.487911060895904	-4.402266521609368	-4.282320259648185	-2.0877990762360787	-1.3132867034751314	-1.0914624693862083	-0.9320485500981811	-0.7967906305345722	-0.6549883652502142	-0.6134029932721079	-0.5886449984939446	0.10795194892757255	0.5264244541493809	0.5585559735299892	0.6724189486563261	0.7074816615299117	0.8765631448280575	0.9241185506289542	1.1415283938579812	1.554469078327874	3.6306623190317415	5.356419129324669	9.317825320982495	
I've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. I later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a Christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.<br /><br />The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing the Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously. Other than that, the songs are half-songs, the melodies are half-melodies and even Meryl Streep cannot make this direction look good.	-2.9920483558614466	-1.7701536061423524	-1.7083906573895415	-1.6457223616615673	-1.577981549986305	-0.8882457079516894	-0.5863095121319996	-0.5079770809358272	-0.46526653866421464	-0.3359627329195526	-0.32669974620677267	-0.17544031357795714	0.0666549886025758	0.13141790252912428	0.32224234889736336	0.3555662510323427	0.40356139771300575	0.5238619764375114	0.5244730286435467	0.5462702311182553	0.6810758188323622	0.8078046390013665	0.8688423876528533	2.375034464797163	4.00968252763217	
When one watches the animated Superman shorts of the 1940s, the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring - the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarter, threatening Metropolis with some evil invention - death rays, mechanical monsters, electric earthquake, magnetic telescope, what have you.<br /><br />This one is refreshingly different. The bad ones drive around in a car, shooting and bombing, but the center of action is the gold train (on which Lois Lane travels, as the only press reporter, it seems). Train movies have their own typical ingredients, from the 1903 Great Train Robbery on, and quite some are featured here: decoupling cars in motion, running on the roofs, taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back, fighting with the engineer, a switch turned to deroute the train on a side track, the fall (of people or the whole train) from a high bridge... it's all in the few minutes of this lovely piece.<br /><br />But it wouldn't be a Superman film if he didn't do some incredible feats (involving balancing and high-precision placement) to ultimately win the day. If you're a fan of train movies, don't miss this.

Here's another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time (even in metropolitan movie capital L.A.!)for a couple of weeks and then disappeared (art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory, where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities).<br /><br />At first I was disappointed, thought the pace to be unbearably boring, and that the man had lost a chance (for years Antonioni had found it difficult to find financing)at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon; but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how I had at first reacted to Blow-Up and the Passenger, I refused to pass judgment until I had seen the film again. I went back the next day and I should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in, making me aware of things I had thought about and lost track of throughout my life, driving home, in a contemporary setting, points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in 'L'Aventurra,' forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone (and quite comedic actually) that I couldn't get enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach, with the weather so beautifully silver skied, and the Eno/U2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm, had been my favorite; it still was, but now the whole film was just as great! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which Antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate. The odd thing is, though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous Sophie Marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you, this film is unmistakably Antonioni's to its core, but you will not sense to what a profound extent, until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm. For example, it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor, something I did not notice at first, but was turned on to by another critic, and noticed to much delight on further viewings (4 before they pulled it and would've gone back for more). If this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it, I have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of Antonioni's '60s films. But the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed DVD version (if and when it's released). I urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see 'Beyond the Clouds' and add a piece of magic to the tragic.	-2.428374460215856	-2.4105280183508544	-2.1390079447075445	-1.9472619886200455	-1.5380889348393918	-0.9509566245511653	-0.8190970817751242	-0.6892230500120919	-0.5029163657150497	-0.36460080795136496	-0.31631965979741244	-0.03442443377284742	0.0026515396268504787	0.04189837891765649	0.06311637801442266	0.1177634769737036	0.31007412043125143	0.4940768388018457	0.8934657736266881	1.1763383544959907	1.5021110945720928	1.6116286613364181	2.0782313500136196	3.201684444296302	4.738419218298637	
I don't know how this DVD made its way into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of these "3 for £20" deals at a high street store. The thing isn't worth 66p, let alone £6.66! Having invested heavily in it, I felt duty-bound to watch it to the end, just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through - and it was.<br /><br />The dialog was awful, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the camera work was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue).<br /><br />In fact there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. She should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it ASAP.<br /><br />As a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father's ex-army sidekick while driving. This was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film - no engine noise whatsoever! I look forward to the engine-damping technology eventually making its way across the pond into British cars!	-4.327020819438668	-2.680839501821611	-2.579549104028354	-2.5203826062357004	-2.2178361407208134	-1.1019141409478463	-0.942198359520789	-0.9196524324100276	-0.7478597738550914	-0.43226636494806236	-0.3196117201252694	-0.23702508042141546	0.21743070312303958	0.2575150098962819	0.2789994975168015	0.329926067488809	0.409628382957277	0.49717147373686915	0.7629699294109988	0.9479915811238615	1.1284936716191327	1.1581465660269188	1.5905580762945193	3.1529041683174426	5.194736785929458	
The 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world, with an emphasis on wild animals, exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures. Despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place, and then bringing 'em back alive (with the film footage), such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional Hollywood features ... because there were no expensive sets, costumes, or high-priced movie stars.<br /><br />The most successful makers of such films (artistically and financially) were the team of Martin E. Johnson and his wife Osa, who made several documentaries (sometimes with blatantly staged events) in Africa and Asia. The Johnsons' safari films were extremely popular, inspiring several parodies ... most notably Wheeler & Woolsey's "So This is Africa", in which the very sexy Esther Muir plays a character named Mrs. Johnson-Martini (instead of Martin E. Johnson, geddit?). Although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time, the Johnsons' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour. Viewed from our own more enlightened (I hope) standpoint, this is a serious flaw in the Johnsons' documentaries: there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana Johnson and his wife.<br /><br />One definite asset of these movies is the presence of Osa Johnson. Ten years younger than her husband, she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter. While certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond Esther Muir, Osa Johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co-produced with her husband.<br /><br />'Congorilla' is probably the best of the Johnsons' films. The shots of the Congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930. The shots of the Pygmies and other natives are also interesting, although these suffer from the Johnsons' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look 'wild' and alien.<br /><br />The best (and funniest) scene in 'Congorilla' is an improvised sequence in which Osa Johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some Pygmy women. (The dance is the Black Bottom, no less ... the same dance which Bob Hope famously taught to Daisy and Violet Hilton, the conjoined twins.) Wearing jodhpurs, riding boots, and a pith helmet, Osa Johnson starts scat-singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the African women. Meanwhile, they just stand there staring at her, apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish. It's a very funny scene, but it has unpleasant undertones. Osa Johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black Americans: the implication seems to be that black Africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration (using natural rhythm, I guess) because it's in their blood, or something.<br /><br />I'll rate 'Congorilla' 4 points out of 10. This film says a little bit about African life in the 1930s and rather more about American cultural perceptions in that same decade.	-6.435436957270651	-3.790144291649558	-3.403085673299559	-2.4297132861211774	-2.2874064352024663	-1.9967658204596086	-1.0814495227126053	-0.9785841176616804	-0.7265335272592859	-0.7102027738235028	-0.6816874651378246	-0.10684206439664282	-0.06253505233057131	0.35147429089068294	0.567789607740259	0.6331084369929878	0.6373157334569475	0.9122445643372894	1.1580302918483234	1.2761489414836618	1.5249828572203	1.6630591325294501	1.8734427377336786	4.1670812713207885	7.486957446862438	
This movie is really BAD, there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings: Chilean landscape. I know I must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie, but the thing is that it is such a bad movie, that I can only say that is actually BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film.	-1.4684723282134993	-0.851019443319255	-0.7714584709331864	-0.6508001138474719	-0.6207932057205529	-0.4172496548635662	-0.26418428153705503	-0.23274188675557184	-0.17677803987995605	-0.1757486477739049	-0.16571547441496337	-0.1504169111374132	-0.15020036406504467	-0.11666885684753386	-0.05639019136036298	-0.011366743806558027	-0.008881452811469126	0.11507042815682252	0.20208289104219368	0.2684660517415032	0.3772596620136227	0.45641621890348516	0.5463506848132935	0.6659939683227253	1.4018822185783346	
I've tried watching it twice, though I haven't been able to make through either episode. For me, it's basically just not funny. I can tell where I'm suppose to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies like Married...With Children and Family Guy, but this show just doesn't' do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it isn't. They're trying too hard to be different, and tying to force the humor. That style usually doesn't work too well. I don't think this show finishes the season. Of course, I could be wrong.	-5.665879870634823	-2.4571924318123766	-2.160432466726833	-2.1118392484278123	-2.0240068192506717	-1.7028701360324974	-1.6830500927876473	-0.7266379261969976	-0.6513800248334678	-0.37744048490238	-0.32975104654572973	-0.14190170931162002	0.04176274112046219	0.1340426560276553	0.2358473126778508	0.3910831966180074	0.44567674869842194	0.4492347866963997	0.6744818588568979	0.7337255347228453	0.7528944049310894	1.163884002031251	2.5684039879990865	2.976301813763802	6.224718382133206	
The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, no nothing! The action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up advertisements stitched together. Heavily influenced from The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but very poorly executed.<br /><br />I did not go a lot of expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder "What were these guys thinking??!!".<br /><br />The only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini.<br /><br />The reason why I did not give a rating of '1' is that every time I think I have seen the worst, Bollywood proves me wrong.	-5.374147010200742	-2.7811363033694656	-2.7709850983853075	-2.4508701356111247	-2.2398087204212325	-1.0988538657182545	-0.9595463786467815	-0.9387787862703006	-0.7814464360704317	-0.42423700733402525	-0.20813624540504724	-0.19328198526825519	-0.08300714688454335	0.007524025426410966	0.18216657742394565	0.219971059396943	0.2568849383005627	0.26427689400046106	0.3072383398505789	0.3639665683962711	0.8123478801603639	1.0062231317237882	1.6363383482301943	2.8625664109852695	5.000513498001714	
Richard Linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.	-1.9615677322772678	-0.9940934610733625	-0.6371290744764139	-0.4443112577579914	-0.18673013101800723	-0.11415244697524383	0.0020748017151555054	0.023000088231295946	0.16667021853518985	0.20082871460252966	0.30217310408931597	0.35342346871469615	0.36268911734408116	0.3761842224576496	0.46539243001385017	0.5727507113459622	0.6236566776468518	0.6795712611890916	0.7769664714995146	0.794787012764493	0.9206238436134764	0.9799367188854687	0.9894223095557435	1.6456823875128874	1.8138748869124708	
The storyline was okay. Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner. I don't know why the hell did Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role. There was nothing much to do for him in the movie. Just because it is a Yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is. Said Ali khan was alright. I think that it is high time that Indian directors and producers start thinking of Indian customers as intelligent lot. What are we ? fools!!!! What do they think, they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them. Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals.... they take an entire squad of 100 + policemen and no one was there to surround the palace. The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action. Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen all shooting at him..... and he shooting back at them. None of the policemen's bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen. Crap. CRAP.<br /><br />I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement.<br /><br />I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.	-7.591656533072569	-4.247442782723693	-3.7536920180782665	-3.2945527888190673	-3.132362241385636	-1.5661316401999146	-1.5558568746235528	-1.1450121610665847	-0.8964031588802368	-0.8303651361327529	-0.8115762096159854	-0.7838470988640325	-0.23911855148075314	-0.16135275155482767	0.07649165805520222	0.17378852820583318	0.26244027687716015	0.29059861111937946	1.4723928975613387	1.5238138207983303	1.8008667116082864	2.129638049690241	2.6035252802787614	4.441294588540843	7.722657548965789	
Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide. It's a very gory, bloody sequence. Then it jumps to present day...well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little kid move to Japan for hubby's work. They rent a house and--surprise! surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place! The three dead people are around as ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family.<br /><br />Sounds OK--but it's really hopeless. There's a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between. There is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious! They look so fake--I swear I saw the strings pulling one along--and they're muttering!!!!! There's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show off George's body), another one about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary to the plot) and a really silly exorcism towards the end. The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />As for acting--Albert was OK as the husband and McClure was pretty good as a family friend. But George--as always--is terrific in a lousy film. She gives this film a much needed lift--but can't save it. I'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing. That aside, this is a very boring film.	-7.122194207329125	-3.9826094670330408	-3.1446943206007374	-2.9286088327548123	-2.604093500621873	-2.434894477808381	-2.1628977381849683	-0.5841278296846026	-0.5461694028208187	-0.23250631140255706	0.02791293428836801	0.03269209341136356	0.2265508310449929	0.2788816636340829	0.3503816985689735	0.39663401875427556	0.45224893369434305	0.5469400635812582	0.7710603625652219	1.147264385468336	1.3254606776322684	1.3995647106855162	3.1073856213680857	3.8620860633687544	8.29148430676194	
I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. I watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again. The excessive amount of watery 'blood' at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the "whip-around" wind sounds. My friends and I made a super low budget movie, and the effects still exceeded this crap fest.<br /><br />As for the amount of mistakes in this movie, there are way too many to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my THEATRE teacher. HA! <br /><br />Final verdict: Don't bother with this "horror" flick. <br /><br />3 Stars (out of a possible 73)	-3.584721637794712	-1.720025657821825	-1.5432232443667009	-1.2759301168142738	-1.142889450485793	-0.9871376297483968	-0.6617501727320287	-0.5635756616769223	-0.48887185438990627	-0.48254520281504515	-0.37762796015239336	-0.34039007743294003	-0.2701499185367467	-0.2362166110348539	-0.13625879121838222	0.08835435975743255	0.19996939031570046	0.26413375322649335	0.3900146014494817	0.801257601691004	0.8358370815155332	0.9918351582135978	1.0930284638659051	1.8467014262877002	3.7814861192513227	
Wow. What a wonderful film. The script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by Minglun Wei,I hope he has more stories in him.<br /><br />The acting is sublime. Renying Zhou as Doggie was amazing -- very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist. <br /><br />The soundtrack was very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. <br /><br />If only more movies like this were made whether in Hollywood or Hong Kong- a family friendly, well acted, well written, well directed, near perfect gem.	-3.478928088823562	-1.2087225003330233	-0.8829639092193224	-0.6879325736213279	-0.5022902393836165	-0.46960383124873395	-0.3313332052910144	-0.3012340821494697	-0.26832499565877493	-0.2096751310132832	-0.16515757726953176	0.3606891186257201	0.4426553692532845	0.6754489760109498	0.8548349480924432	0.8608232283170135	0.8730772462151828	1.1709712192595216	1.2179226327123307	1.3279809413539503	1.6425402902386983	1.757273090844713	2.0752442979776218	2.1282492401256965	2.788285324273975	
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.<br /><br />I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is false advertising - she's on-screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on Quaaludes, the directing was ... well, let's just say that my 14-yo daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such faint praise from me. It's possible that the family cat could have done better.<br /><br />Sandra does a creditable job for a first film, in the short time she's on-screen - and that's the only redeeming quality of this film. Stupid story, poorly written, and transferred to film as only a 7th-grade Media class should be able to do.<br /><br />In short, this is dreck.	-4.275109942436601	-2.716388828576173	-2.594658007598955	-2.542354537165822	-2.38070533733048	-1.1393860519536627	-0.8950146142501474	-0.6788809941512012	-0.5877928746965974	-0.3693302359206037	-0.2993214756821463	-0.22184800054284154	-0.18048512030236208	-0.06884717201924759	0.07540924427282028	0.16242965796863912	0.3286518378060152	0.38824813293702065	0.7330628488931326	0.8476610221652368	0.9948231795586557	1.0095573410147485	1.4304021554035038	2.8690746495534234	4.732800503496865	
Radio was a very good movie, and honestly, i never cry in movies. But it had me pretty close to tears. It really got to me when Radio's mom died and he just wouldn't get out of his room. I felt really sad about how, if you were mentally retarded, you wouldn't really be able to understand death. I really liked the movie, and It's a must see.	-1.6079330491236448	-1.0458546409968021	-0.7466952269664441	-0.5603561354862345	-0.3042772457623516	-0.24506037670284592	-0.2133865737692319	-0.17076475071250835	-0.14080113186509194	0.07313995092494352	0.09015774367721864	0.09347443253847819	0.16682087240122936	0.2313729956198888	0.27398423089399637	0.3228795853310928	0.32588031518646005	0.35762255476132654	0.5108071115772085	0.6441743021295927	0.6913823001737431	1.1524470908046447	1.1741631162324317	1.7664430171820422	1.9430684061429822	
'Flight Of Fury' is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring Action Film - I don't expect a lot from a Seagal Film, all I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action -unfortunately this doesn't even achieve that low expectation, The action scenes are few and far between, the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these Films) is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout, The acting is truly abysmal - bordering on embarrassing with Seagal and his whispering One expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters - I find it hard to believe that anything close to $12M was spent on this dire mess unless $11M of that 12 was Seagal's Salary - I somehow doubt it! The one moment of any interest to Straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that - It's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the Michael Dudikoff B-Movies I've endured<br /><br />1/10	-1.6694981163830311	-1.2009912066184332	-1.195966748081062	-1.1144494529498599	-1.0023614458049965	-0.5703307214347333	-0.5606915419828133	-0.49788222154532835	-0.3052829255444952	-0.23566462253818402	-0.21289261068447557	-0.18241934621569408	-0.17636566710759125	0.15290339075377676	0.17857896670536313	0.18238299792078577	0.22655567284529593	0.34413011572867497	0.3633401789980127	0.4296934043755636	0.5919271570157146	0.6307145962235653	0.9428068355939545	1.1370466100080083	1.786833981338299	
Spoilers Following: I picked up the book "Evil Angels" when it first came out knowing nothing of the case. Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here, I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlain's guilt. The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did. John Bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors (and picked up by the press) of the arterial spray, the actelone (??) plates, Dr. James Cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up, bloody hand print, etc. all quite convincingly. After all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all. It was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand. To this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people didn't believe it was possible. The public was suspicious of the Seventh Day Adventists, whose origins made them appear to be a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. Were it not for dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony, finding Azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get Lindy out of jail. The book shook me for that reason, and I've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since (excepting OJ of course). I was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better. I've always liked Sam, who I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photography, haunting music. I think it's not only a very good, but a very important, movie. Too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released.	-6.645650905727196	-3.869018532650737	-3.746017482662853	-3.389893758887857	-2.6535128918423214	-1.7932886750893038	-1.309075356919641	-0.8766490985813049	-0.851798342070154	-0.172324748489738	-0.048581948509270056	0.05861636631985703	0.09969427670999423	0.2491846541096594	0.6081885030364313	0.6474048870384381	0.6689844181031539	0.7888441945134718	0.9594694051582932	1.297186700026286	1.7291141528613805	1.810298250967148	2.074748403723897	4.876998541232097	8.593005043132916	
I was stunned by this film. Afterwards, I didn't even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.<br /><br />For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of Wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.<br /><br />But for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.<br /><br />	-2.618732063406184	-1.5986840938023157	-1.5498543453449793	-1.389738357476897	-1.2807509959204257	-0.5481630589892119	-0.410011308479743	-0.3170872910791461	-0.30806689909469126	-0.2904443629600181	-0.2526405198084677	-0.224311035709403	-0.1434803705511596	-0.03492624772747596	0.04675145485670901	0.09865295758266222	0.1096638170591856	0.24928107003618452	0.3003582796878991	0.6243278278260302	0.6469246692188823	0.6665168299344848	0.8846864485911746	1.697933637791544	2.7768068063128304	
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey'. Endless nature footage, bad acting - Aside from these elements, this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases, is considered a cult classic.<br /><br />Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play pretty well off each other. There's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not too bad if I do say so myself.<br /><br />The last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace. The ending still haunts me to this day. This can also sport a short lived plus in that an early John Carl Bucheler does the special effects. Some may know him from films like 'Troll' and 'Friday the 13th part 7 - He directed both these films) All in all, this isn't a movie everyone will find something redeeming in. In fact, on a Hollywood level, this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts, but for that handful (yet very loyal) of slasher movie fans in the world, even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven.	-3.579283974106216	-2.24523465579513	-1.8964902414839626	-1.794832330710865	-1.6063527092090615	-1.148972619324333	-0.8465934614341193	-0.13292301218463723	-0.11661237109932523	-0.055959499217744624	0.11671984591006074	0.14922585329411048	0.1622936060909512	0.17540653392257155	0.24717445178884206	0.30621000542654603	0.34072628792195575	0.4747249798089798	0.48658253124446327	0.8010195640720299	0.869996074247262	0.9972432609048294	1.312156796916729	1.6543081935661603	4.158502297597413	
I first saw it at 5am January 1, 2009, and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again. Love everything (well, almost, so 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops. But this is not a musical after all. I like Anna's acting, this naive wannabe gangster girl, how she speaks, holds the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not that funny, though i have laughed a bit at some moments, it's just so subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Though 3d nouvelle seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, cause they are stealing ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. Makes me feel so warm and.. romantic. Yes, i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such art-housish movies. And i don't agree with those comparing it to Pulp Fiction. It's not about action and twisted story, though all vignettes intersect. It's calm, and maybe too slow movie for most of the people. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, probably this review won't be of much help to anyone (my first), just wanted to express my appreciation.<br /><br />SPOILER: This movie doesn't have a Goofs section. Wonder, didn't anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the kidnappers decided to go home? Looks like a part of crew, hehe. I know i should better post this in forums, but i don't agree with some policies here.	-4.857628551685783	-4.579642257997218	-3.9816869329080165	-3.029529325396179	-1.9075691056830115	-1.7824638096278238	-1.3164604679366227	-0.801242378743117	-0.7898542847235754	-0.623331468464793	-0.4933602202941941	-0.3659197028348995	0.07712205266565475	0.22276953928887222	0.4113995003388319	0.4795276872403646	0.6756352743187962	0.9517999348104306	1.027174262321257	1.171049322833602	2.6133278782920177	3.139739355337519	3.363242857676436	4.766910553360779	7.958625443165677	
I'll keep this short; thanks to Greg for helping me to put this succinctly: Captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl's drink, imprisons and tortures her, then poses as a captive to have sex with her. That is the single twist and punchline of the film. It's torture as slow motion date rape. And, it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad it's good; it's just bad.<br /><br />It should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile. Why NO ONE had the cojones to step up and say, "this is garbage, and this is why," is beyond me.<br /><br />Don't give your money to these poop-peddlers.	-3.702905779534842	-2.145217092389619	-2.141038067961889	-2.0798129871573305	-1.7717910172580535	-0.9050701016535824	-0.8158451372832073	-0.7404992165717691	-0.6037426677387642	-0.3398466475773429	-0.2987645257544563	-0.22855394279795743	0.012161658872197466	0.03390488734619315	0.19230340527896184	0.29582565669494515	0.3625816776692832	0.41004413748501656	0.7136106549636535	0.7554843010005798	0.8557117829677284	0.9057490307697033	0.9585846681092637	2.4193256439603825	4.190695152161031	
Stargate SG-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie "Stargate." I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject. The show gets it rolling from the very first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her, and there is Teal'c, a quiet, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. <br /><br />The main bad guys are called the Gouald, they are parasites who can get inserted into one's brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds. Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a "System Lord." The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa, who house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can get inserted in a person's brain.<br /><br />Through the episodes, we mostly get to see SG-1, the exploratory team comprised of Jack/Daniel/Teal'c/and Sam, go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets (this device is called the Stargate) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes are on-world, meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth.<br /><br />Through the years, you start to see a decline in the SG-1 team as close knit, and more character-building story lines. This, in turn means even more on-world episodes, which is perfectly understandable.<br /><br />My rating: 8.75/10----While most of this show is good, there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years. But still, top notch science fiction!	-4.290946237170578	-3.0256186188405296	-2.6159321695905575	-2.3136880980492203	-1.8882008798276766	-0.8094165421541129	-0.7581395299774538	-0.6934774063083894	-0.6642254868329692	-0.3203707879711043	-0.24879146328708232	-0.23583682904835168	-0.12646884835389516	0.11276109927928965	0.18701114311531217	0.23831941478157437	0.2774749721915193	1.0286398390126532	1.1281074790780263	1.3239938784969438	1.335406423423095	1.342169042558639	1.6978757124873698	3.4621260476540283	5.5592469352146905	
Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm. It's a yakuza/triad picture, involving cops versus Japanese &/or Chinese gangsters (mostly Chinese, as the title suggests), but already even in his first technical 'debut', Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in. Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and one's roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbing-of-the-nose at taboos like gay sex and (satirical) rape/violence towards women; blood-curdling violence. It's certainly not as surreal as some of Miike's most recent films, but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers. It's got all of those qualities, and it's also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy (in spots) and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans.<br /><br />The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya (Kippei Shiina, pretty decent as a Eastwood-esquire anti-hero/hero), who's become a detective, and another, who's become a gangster, or a would-be one. The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang (a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare-time, played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes), and his partner Karino (Takeshi Caesar, who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal), who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie. There's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gang's penchant for gay sex- at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want. It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare (hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying "it won't come off").<br /><br />If it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it's par for the course of a film like this. Miike's goals are met, though just met, in his low-scale ambitions: a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble (the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents), notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters. At the same time, Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black-comedy from the Miike oeuvre. Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the "interrogation" as it goes into a very twisted area. There's even a laugh-out-loud line from the young sex-slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses: "Thank you, Mr. Weeny-Burger." Miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like Ichi or, of course, Visitor Q, but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.<br /><br />As the first entry of the "Black Society" trilogy, as it's called, I was quite impressed, and it's a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.	-5.386050376989293	-4.043856166259787	-3.869214261088098	-3.1556487435773444	-3.008010198286954	-2.6490112353183437	-1.455083324579604	-1.2605718890295565	-0.414299615298028	-0.05547929196154891	0.1672182081910665	0.19268476866839637	0.2525393241546734	0.2868822741441557	0.36917188428370473	0.5323525455771249	0.6265250870805857	1.0364629441552684	1.1819971135279135	1.3276998380839484	1.481203234415966	2.2833016966889472	2.5780417822630004	4.882909927190446	8.570089977696659	
Being a great fan of horror, especially Asian horror, I have seen tons of movies, but this one is outstanding. Why? It does have a plot (which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies). The actors did a good job. It feels like a real documentary film (even if it's not). It does not get boring for a moment. The director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain Japanese magic cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but still, it's believable). It reminded me of the similarly great movie "Forbidden Siren".<br /><br />To me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character Hori, the psychic, but this is subjective.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror.<br /><br />9 out of 10.	-2.8161329669818365	-1.7622194097896438	-1.4036569896356508	-1.2502501528967067	-0.7709108851744106	-0.5445422119115775	-0.4304293954460298	-0.3596314941653307	-0.29804563006986096	-0.09770000897142965	-0.04513500437259588	-0.03766126272037254	0.034617070106132866	0.08025201785620302	0.21632526581824466	0.3453303323825991	0.3663018578391397	0.6057519082226765	0.6482063032291073	0.7974899998475254	0.8085858191711607	1.05978791780824	2.3819178815628126	2.518210044473071	3.5060502769511643	
There is an excellent reason Edison went straight to video: it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud. The movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring. Just a notch above lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films), the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non-existent as Justin Timberlake's acting. I hate to knock the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better.<br /><br />The movie isn't all bad...just mostly. I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well (you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery), and Freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars (out of ten...he's not THAT good).<br /><br />When all is said and done, the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake. It also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters. All in all, t's just plain boring. That being said, rent this when you are suffering from insomnia.	-5.482839282029715	-3.526509853901369	-3.4967143501364935	-3.004851291829084	-2.525456816803555	-2.168727230377323	-1.3790874551276437	-0.7138443304088375	-0.6538159304959457	-0.41017961980384054	-0.36353667434786263	-0.037615554145993185	0.017880564820047212	0.06735778049847081	0.13088351986051971	0.42029937369876336	0.6768160237424056	0.876296999389395	0.88129507354408	1.1313006038779678	1.2544432251296807	1.2831381716250603	1.4715735459634136	4.259003452623169	6.649603332354863	
And obviously I didn't see it! <br /><br />But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I know now to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. A supposedly dead Doug Masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?<br /><br />And I can't believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return for something like that.<br /><br />Did Jason Gedrick really decline this? Well, I hate to say it, but even if he took the role again, it would have still had that same continuity error. I bet (if he really turned it down), he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film.<br /><br />I'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel, but no way am I going to rent this or buy the DVD!	-5.626497594866309	-2.492666495925111	-2.3384365209869853	-2.3068928400563142	-2.2450148779911636	-1.703668075074524	-0.7358685266840811	-0.5477381925733698	-0.45141956323668253	-0.43918766485261146	-0.36379969686238534	-0.3274092248434166	-0.14445870318325807	-0.08178612145436838	0.17771325344175312	0.39624450669851025	0.5059026655322474	0.5242163981809042	0.6353050280756758	0.7003920972080695	0.7430209852609105	0.7649929771794287	2.304798187015493	3.023427292138599	5.953942142606813	
Two years after this movie was made, "The Juror" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. See "The Juror" instead. "The Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial By Jury," with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. William Hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and Armand Assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. You didn't become involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her. Also, the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn't compelling or interesting in any way. Kathleen Quinlan's role as a hooker/killer wasn't fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot.	-2.5898301763267693	-1.7434018112385832	-1.6887029814001815	-1.4005972391106838	-1.341850387801677	-1.0028953917102053	-0.8119828630168068	-0.49414138173659805	-0.3772451625159424	-0.26184545075861	-0.22562029696104163	-0.19744821173989538	-0.08630762633199068	-0.06684834657879637	-0.03261978123732423	-0.009094530563557586	0.06600897571683673	0.16875434671539885	0.6788409596306605	0.7856799173246433	0.9346046897375718	1.0628135214502161	1.3654815421565731	2.130888463819886	3.600611759629566	
This is an excellent movie. Phoolan had no role model's to base her actions on, yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment. I like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up, it added to the horror of the story, & the triumph.	-0.9665427841089188	-0.7440556578621673	-0.5058047880399982	-0.4446583766139934	-0.27230159860955183	-0.16136768530675732	-0.02953316421092143	-0.016146774048498853	0.01144676883472262	0.017552371519747388	0.08182310606959026	0.09822624230821844	0.11554018196829513	0.21843014800160362	0.26463361278420405	0.26885782649530016	0.3075698463604655	0.38079845674623175	0.39986310227482214	0.4226906623722706	0.5224631152154092	0.5640781040297075	0.9396095354336499	1.1392489552534342	1.1632539288785224	
This is the worst movie I have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from Asperger's syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. One comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear? Were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts? They certainly did not deserve paying with anything else! This appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half, blending into an equally confused arch Christian biblefest in the latter. The entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake, or at the very least crucified!	-3.983246405843567	-2.4142418998484496	-2.385062437448176	-2.245857574750495	-1.9848560755658657	-1.4032470753314419	-0.8944416637222765	-0.7949252685628927	-0.7536727703015922	-0.2829506841606006	-0.20928292462731252	-0.14952985571125002	0.001869304678807724	0.011950633689817747	0.024603141815850375	0.03458061677103228	0.31134233537790224	0.36686092374556195	0.7058399401641117	0.7857570225789994	0.8130124479138336	0.8143822600702875	1.5778314459413936	2.5271202354189057	3.9468293773089034	
I was pulled into this movie early on, much to my surprise, because I hadn't intended to watch it at all. Now I wish I hadn't. The suspense starts out well, with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be found out, or (doable now, though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. The plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it, with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair, make for an absorbing first half. Then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited, all-suffering loves. The two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other, and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film, in the midst of the movie's second funeral, I found myself thinking, "Now, what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run?" The filmmakers may think the answer obvious, but I think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily.	-4.152256391005302	-1.8545685004436239	-1.7508438675404034	-1.7102506595945428	-1.4787737480662217	-1.1858821760754492	-0.9747423726641389	-0.42684586654427564	-0.38988661506296896	-0.28999477007118335	-0.2206376107055869	0.10137735256821324	0.14593532584227728	0.20919543101732144	0.24452268943029956	0.3159261451737194	0.48547973608021266	0.5729193176620653	0.7042882953696006	0.7158490033092744	0.8387284965401197	0.9347353222619426	1.4880704799025946	2.378217157671875	4.983177584236537	
i have to rate this movie at a 10. i'm sorry but i think it's classic comedy. then, if you're rating it to other Madonna movies...well, what? you wanna tell me it wasn't her best movie ever? didn't Mira Sorvino win an Oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later? please, this movie deserves much more credit than it gets. plus, i like to think of it as an A+ sociological study into the lifestyles of the 80's. remember when you could shoplift from Sam Goody and Cartier in the same day? remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly? so it was no "Last Emperor", it was still good. there are certain movies i'd be willing to watch everyday. three, actually, that pep up my day and make me smile. if you like "Who's That Girl?" then i'd also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".	-2.043655386206975	-1.8053708362276515	-1.7629957189899672	-0.9586992840893963	-0.6915662081711504	-0.6740519383059833	-0.6573198349780934	-0.6567253103373134	-0.4874664201521242	-0.21108441822658916	-0.10848360303005719	0.12070340501858876	0.16363540549733196	0.16396970545247852	0.2073516352075116	0.2836450262738071	0.4368925015550616	0.4541434138206026	0.47473796379841965	0.5853038740390673	0.7678480869075318	0.993832389730519	1.3234224678682032	1.6945572169924419	3.0858410689522944	
When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience. For it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing turns into a circus. Lindy doesn't help matters either because she won't play to the jury or courtroom, she's only herself, and she's a tough nut to crack, so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there's a piece of evidence that hasn't come to light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-Day adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It's good (or bad) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too, because the Australian public doesn't believe the story and the media only fans the flames. Eventually, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor, but years later, a missing piece of evidence shows up and she's freed, but not until after the family's life is basically ruined. A heart-breaking story, very well done, a bit long but well worth seeing. 8 out of 10.	-3.0263130727732923	-2.052947697288021	-1.9861924546719496	-1.809474185027651	-1.3814510196805783	-1.2486484782320928	-0.6200411952271282	-0.6190926443548092	-0.3100214362741045	-0.07033506954782547	0.08135682749380609	0.08730150531508558	0.1137265411203749	0.17935573063398735	0.2268687976385484	0.37636428866123844	0.41185112055891776	0.5848171950352061	0.60131527590941	0.7412695502520881	0.8764251461158771	0.9966904211950702	1.2022780134236064	2.7191966886167673	4.535752607313737	
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have Galaxina.<br /><br />This film came out when the Original Star Wars proved there was a market for Science Fiction. This in turn lead to some gems such as Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say obviously, because I hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.I missed it when it came out in 1980.) <br /><br />Here's the underlying problem. Dorothy Stratton couldn't act, so for most of the movie, they didn't even let her try. I understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for the life of me I can't understand why.<br /><br />Clearly, the movie tried to Spoof Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens, but they clearly don't understand than when you spoof something, it has to be FUNNY! This movie wasn't, or at least, the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren't. Science Fiction is ripe for parody, as Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest proved. This movie, however, did it poorly.	-6.302127719777935	-3.004247492243899	-2.67586082161303	-2.574661199704406	-2.4707861982705888	-1.4016724312884565	-0.7756556743219527	-0.6762397444882042	-0.5863382787531111	-0.5353538612238617	-0.5048329907622982	-0.41342523083009236	-0.08329859324528519	0.28767463908873586	0.3445067024878987	0.34497889396938736	0.5109595220704737	0.7592122970818572	0.8416683634061064	0.9600336835551433	0.9974425743063324	1.0455130726746125	1.999537248567659	3.435424551515744	6.548347126670451	
This is one of the best films I have ever seen! How anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination! First of all, Gooding's and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. That is the only way I can describe the acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off; then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it was based on a true person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. For all the action buffs, it might be a little slow, but then it's not an action film. I definitely give this movie a 10. It deserves nothing less!	-2.956569469581468	-2.743917601747776	-2.2003528603113995	-1.7412593235912923	-1.575004049250274	-1.1355465718539544	-0.5183525708072189	-0.058130383714654205	-0.02681788142827641	0.008988034453866936	0.0503170432683213	0.26293329951193534	0.34183284878192105	0.4240075458782272	0.5981741436211545	0.7819187781193979	0.8461217667110926	0.9718327881653286	1.5227028633960322	1.563188446193548	1.6334199615993503	1.8677650644586552	3.3138233544853475	3.508967164036849	3.5358872005552664	
This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maugham's short tales. The first one is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write. So what does he do? Opens a tobacco shop, of course!<br /><br />The second is Mr. Know-All which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten, until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minute one, and also very good. It worked better on film than in a book for me, but then perhaps that's because I was only 14 the last time, afterall.<br /><br />The 3rd one is nearly a let-down. Almost an hour in length, it simply drags. It's not all that bad, but not as quick and snappy as the last 2. I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour, and found that it still made sense and really I hadn't missed a thing!<br /><br />Overall I give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.	-4.296999180578192	-2.7006952252892713	-2.2938108379039184	-1.9511552811693331	-1.3063721345733195	-1.2468048098643312	-1.1924652393233748	-0.20329778332761994	-0.14252863946626954	-0.03954835582355119	6.987844381887015E-4	0.05937750357825169	0.06190857591219283	0.13341023337244473	0.2663595053702259	0.4163609844168277	0.5353964970018583	0.7115269496673765	0.8478172174845187	1.0068613375348996	1.0268959604997894	1.2628924263722812	1.6417241584070885	3.2150799146124127	5.91817674576354	
"House of Games" is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends. I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Ebert's review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. Boy, was I in for a surprise. This was one of the smartest, most well-written movies I had ever seen.<br /><br />The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development. On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film. I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset. Their work, plus Mamet's extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's. It is truly a must-see.	-5.492264259937382	-3.422916286592582	-2.36433584576725	-1.7856608242880834	-1.7506434132387878	-0.7952738899392913	-0.35500723818694435	-0.27553093982325927	0.2210620244468145	0.3899656769370592	0.6096026402839159	0.7856780886577845	0.8148661069993539	1.005949826443889	1.0846254871402217	1.3096263145107627	1.5872596414565847	1.7322355725335283	1.7971342998111228	1.799086305658161	2.460102819753276	2.54334162029789	3.646070559456697	3.7463665611653503	5.493999324089211	
Ignoring Rocky 3, this is easily Hulk Hogan's best film, and it still rates as one of the worst films ever.

BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap.<br /><br />I've never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful. Like the movies I said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He is the worst out there.<br /><br />The credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in. The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots. The editing is easily the worst. This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I couldn't take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP!	-8.313168917492003	-4.689125157340567	-4.655062702835443	-4.131648461414484	-4.076565456256623	-1.7443353380090134	-1.4532979822139054	-0.868824199128151	-0.7138822523338285	-0.643400422046606	-0.44237141431369514	-0.4051642942628497	-0.142417583221018	0.015308163756104762	0.14750050623362293	0.43759887717429197	0.5778487625769898	0.7443990933105441	0.9891595115143345	1.0303418446146861	1.459237245823918	1.7753857978811136	3.3149517978732064	4.8662921229651435	8.497186719807026	
This one is tough to watch -- as an earlier reviewer says. That is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after WWII -- particularly the "liberation" of Dachau. It is clear that, as of the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows a "transport" is vivid, almost as if based upon an actual newsreel (the Nazis liked to record their atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He charts the course of a Nazi career. That charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans, at first laughing at Hitler, then incredulous, and finally helpless. That contrast, however, permits us to believe in the "conversion" of one young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi stance. That did happen, as witness the several attempts against Hitler, most notably the Staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out. A strong film, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicting the Nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended.	-2.2173650223733823	-1.5548442443653863	-1.4456238524851772	-1.2799199226834606	-0.6166009296087777	-0.6111971477568507	-0.5851594385808638	-0.5186345831447303	-0.14600791254724352	0.15048332142318188	0.17294570859612157	0.21035538892222339	0.27381770135581857	0.3232441387302646	0.3289413342662464	0.3518108765164199	0.42584794003972526	0.4324310715997737	0.4679554677462529	0.6428013098427688	0.7712887726675266	0.8938632874583707	1.8826972984558137	2.449740856610892	3.890860820177446	
"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies EVER!!! I think I saw this movie years ago on late night TV with my mother when I was little and I thought it was so funny. This movie was also referred to as a "black American Graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful as Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is great as Preach's friend Cochise. There are some other great characters in it as well, and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it. From the beginning of the movie where Cochise goes to Preach's home to get ready for school to the sad ending of Cochise's funeral, this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way. There are a lot of scenes in this film that I like a lot. The scene where Pooter (another one of Preach and Cochise's friends) go to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla's feces thrown on his shirt (very gross, but funny as well), the first scene in the street corner cafeteria, the quarter party at this girl's house which became a disaster due to a fight, and some others are wonderful to watch. This movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album, which is packed with a lot of wonderful Motown hits and artists from the early 60s (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in '75, while the rest were from the '60s). The movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school, but their futures seem almost out of reach, due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for, and Preach's relationship with his girlfriend, Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) almost gets put in jeopardy. Go out and rent or buy this movie, and be ready for a load of comical entertainment!!! Get the soundtrack, too. It is a lot of fun as well!!!	-4.8754489132040515	-4.053222665946615	-2.3328876979803543	-1.9799710329222484	-1.7008074288072823	-0.4865869966016324	-0.34821320641992864	-0.1817356372424639	0.13507642598960634	0.30202561991161586	0.39609170309226666	0.5424803853224434	0.6565925838819963	0.7085196686881501	0.8085395649286075	1.0090495454839807	1.2112678539932968	1.627542497682337	1.6605232492811497	2.2703544820805828	2.442105359784828	2.6592488106137178	3.1934101804742396	4.2071203617003	5.014647094789509	
There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime, but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives. These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore. We don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they. We are too afraid to check that out.<br /><br />The movie 'Before Sunrise' just caught me watching it. I never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I gave a look for the rest of the film. I didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.	-2.7954902412854223	-1.8458384465719844	-1.1988199362751084	-0.987947145475072	-0.946232867555852	-0.873863940755968	-0.5238591111633262	-0.5171139645191273	-0.4347015287117983	-0.4158936253591714	-0.38274546213302596	-0.34048998494778	-0.031262701662662803	0.02965613877656737	0.16818519455386932	0.1792896116408918	0.20214175141988472	0.5005057454109224	0.5533010042950512	0.6005940781178634	0.7513336127770254	0.8206212638543199	1.4443886522190765	1.7913472825034702	3.4778508392135983	
I LOVED this movie. You can't buy it, rent it, or find it... but it's a keeper.<br /><br />Wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken... and Ferrar....<br /><br />Terrific non stop action and reactions.... loved it.<br /><br />I've watched my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade... each time showing it to someone who never heard of it.<br /><br />Find this movie and watch it. <br /><br />So many films are on TV over and over again - without any of the wit and style of this little film.<br /><br />I didn't know it was made for TV... my copy is an 8 track I pirated years ago... I hope it lasts.	-1.6705978669457648	-1.2898722284573358	-1.0096330681052592	-0.9010745401727485	-0.832244688118059	-0.7052893155425928	-0.4653398724852631	-0.3059608284161418	-0.1886580691767783	-0.16992697753373742	-0.039363565711292375	0.03253402228426261	0.15542060029078691	0.21622552448557603	0.23566746311556164	0.2652243901265967	0.34508273177662074	0.5404926079719898	0.5461889557762721	0.6566367070870239	0.964762865163673	1.0442204618929685	1.0735825247907231	1.732631120904622	2.418382849413848	
Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting, writing, and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However, I think there is some other problems here.<br /><br />1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e. "The Bible doesn't say there is aliens." "Well, the Bible doesn't say there isn't.), but the actual rebuttal is never answered. The Bible really doesn't say there isn't. So how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand? Or better yet, acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them.<br /><br />2. How come the ONLY two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax? What about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences? What if it's something else entirely? Too bad the film makers already have their minds made up.<br /><br />3. The film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult. That's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present. I'm not necessarily arguing that they don't, but if you're going to say something so asinine you'd better have the facts to back it up.<br /><br />4. Why does the other reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy, the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? It's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool.<br /><br />I WISH this had been an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their "Faith Message" to care much about make a thought provoking movie. As a Christian myself, this saddens me.	-9.418059332328102	-4.367226450719481	-3.9736342323667895	-3.243227193122499	-3.2306502664702417	-1.8627922821496732	-1.828457019169857	-1.6135328757122933	-1.057529382676337	-0.7245479483982742	-0.24540965049046207	-0.23693159005969955	0.11880024674524904	0.14633858653519413	0.3193257306582358	0.3359641355248467	0.415681112110348	0.8457730142014613	0.9762934727521029	1.2863922927001306	1.6452894098097537	1.8917538101174427	3.272787608320997	4.853301354944281	9.418274210958879	
While escaping from a heist of a bank, the outlaw Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the chief-engineer of the Western Union that is surveying the Wild West and had had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work for the Western Union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and the engineer from Harvard Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with the gorgeous Edward's sister Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore) and she chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when the outlaw Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals the Western Union cattle disguised of Indians.<br /><br />"Western Union" is a good but predictable western directed by Fritz Lang. The story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the West, facing thieves and Indians. The entertaining story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of the identity of Jack Slade, there is no surprise in the story. Randolph Scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")	-2.649426665517666	-1.6249431305648274	-1.5962566829017149	-1.4627980287769522	-1.0682042253210358	-0.6286788522537969	-0.5336369641599914	-0.21127228081082272	-0.10956509670668282	-0.08523664282398602	0.009116196563191362	0.03299458846941708	0.15889908046327506	0.16466790449683788	0.28337658686076367	0.3281940194681848	0.4511557493218956	0.4526397487992294	0.4979670196674246	0.5269653196616677	0.8278327208147809	0.8528076956996336	1.4473794028158715	2.4137530727381775	4.327737554210882	
While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. I'm not even sure where to begin as I've got so many problems with this movie. I suppose I'll just number a few of them: <br /><br />1. The Acting  When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you're in trouble? Not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly A-List names. Susan George may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy, but I've never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less said the better.<br /><br />2. The Ghosts  The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at Disney World. And, they are about as frightening. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a characteristic of The House Where Evil Dwells.<br /><br />3. The Plot  How predictable can one movie be? The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters. If you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies.<br /><br />4. The Convenient Priest  What are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over, knocks on the door, and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind.<br /><br />5. Everything Else  It's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about. I suppose I'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture. That's a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie.<br /><br />I'll stop. You should be able to get the idea from what I've already mentioned. And, I haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a multitude of other problems. Be warned, this thing is horrible.	-11.80762039538501	-5.709365013429587	-4.866313459148148	-4.234047126085599	-4.017432606719997	-3.964589372117884	-2.579941091142	-1.9521931244145183	-1.0592693639129553	-0.5519308148277243	0.043601673803699406	0.23661473927247584	0.33038803360202773	0.7664379518374957	0.851254641037243	0.8608378212177566	0.9451671134531235	1.1325901111398764	1.221650610363981	1.4699175336909414	1.4999301543831185	2.0221393975079676	4.7308475254605264	6.0128956288522355	12.720301104606655	
This is, arguably, the worst of the major Ava Gardner films. Yes, she is gorgeous. But that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.<br /><br />In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend that he's Eddie Bracken (which surely embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (!), and Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains a major popular song, "Speak Low." But check out the other, entirely forgettable, pieces. Dick Haymes sings very well, of course, and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for Ava.<br /><br />The sets are cheap, the script is filled with clichés and failed humor, and Tom Conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor (as indeed he was). In short, if you want to see Ava in her prime, buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie.	-4.907223017703259	-2.8016703502122424	-2.6263982885833927	-2.4615921234145426	-2.060502433466464	-2.0497337887385516	-1.0991768242174993	-0.4668684550562002	-0.3611127526217048	-0.29169157322999095	-0.2888835153106073	-0.13124629117476583	0.03551290545927598	0.15987087009126666	0.3158597715232023	0.3969966848470968	0.4432764642853936	0.650243369461763	0.9952580568172325	1.0017968576523986	1.0225354510945672	1.3111871645839084	1.593003792321343	3.668736902799522	6.641243711218471	
My wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end. I am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks, but this movie is unbelievable. If you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles, this is the movie for you. As I watched it I found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him. <br /><br />***Spoiler*** Plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real.<br /><br />A must see for someone in the mental health profession!	-1.6820298460903083	-1.1056325480894533	-0.5901707047574851	-0.5531153110773475	-0.5523686194443058	-0.5367761913436457	-0.4896571113666993	-0.45028593122054805	-0.21755656591305333	-0.20839059178842392	-0.19960091416092218	-0.16997917944463076	-0.13793321552108737	0.042227261113182785	0.07298063514897027	0.10270505646772993	0.21745957765130125	0.3176929418696202	0.40315049259519226	0.4356101179039767	0.4791756418776057	0.502288540358737	0.733881770387237	0.8090318370019183	1.614935605111549	
Abu, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, helps King Ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer.<br /><br />As Europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames, Sir Alexander Korda's London Films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords & sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. It also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.<br /><br />Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician Jaffar. His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boyish Thief, Sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed & action.<br /><br />The rest of the cast do fine work. John Justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he's not transformed into a dog) but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Appearing late in the film, massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.<br /><br />Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play & dialogue). Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer.<br /><br />The film was begun in Britain, but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites & pinks.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) being the one great exception. His final movie, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.	-4.447470897226126	-4.445267248684585	-3.39593871733854	-2.0494738932137384	-1.8105367631921452	-1.6008595767768838	-1.0194956257030028	-0.8894981491954388	-0.7689117858754119	-0.4968421192854044	-0.1520758153823759	0.0392920008437533	0.39446592028254657	0.707344327017077	0.8491288437027562	1.1244787380518304	1.3013807279198721	1.6706969218104366	2.0499296795954476	2.5108950839156345	2.5241990347245906	2.6382575204211913	4.787878279825277	4.943613865600284	7.413420988321997	
This was unusual: a modern-day film which was ultra-nice. In fact, it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts. As I watching this based-on-a-real-life story, I was thinking, "nobody is this nice, this tolerant." Mainly, I was referring to Ed Harris' role as "Coach Jones." I think they went a little overboard on his character, but that's better than the reverse: showing him worse than what he was in real life. Odd to see Harris playing the role, too, since he has a long resume of playing nasty, profane characters.<br /><br />Anyway, I never complain about a nice, feel-good film, and it is nice to see a bunch of well- meaning, kind people. Those folks direct their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy," better known as "Radio," a mentally slow high school kid played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid 1970s in South Carolina. Gooding does a nice job with the role, too. However, like Sean Penn's role of a mentally-challenged man in "I Am Sam," an hour-and-a-half of a character like this is plenty. After that, the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear.<br /><br />Note: It was interesting in one of the documentaries on this DVD to find out that, in real life, in took years for "Radio" to make his transformation, not months as shown in the film.	-2.3756400065170884	-2.0665154881471866	-1.7001838355004022	-1.561524793244611	-1.5375930816081074	-0.8574693468701178	-0.7410633053421036	-0.29992440075831833	-0.09505781836395003	-0.08563765115474892	-0.07292836702873584	0.09941282319522617	0.1749899871000554	0.2259573537308288	0.278091270246835	0.49533377817681823	0.5183626404534574	0.6468947984001413	0.7276556221531173	0.9513615853018729	1.3437568643553752	1.4564598392222579	2.6057633154528634	2.9021960484666782	3.8786245092752623	
I think that the movie was really good. Subject, acting and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music were marvellous. Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male-dominated culture, he has neglected Phoolan's character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her.	-0.89295105198193	-0.518237377907168	-0.5089189810733457	-0.4817918337077751	-0.3887453161735595	-0.3429954946845486	-0.32340586835348467	-0.20843821947060484	-0.18528674181676322	-0.15705235666489392	-0.09187543313461935	-0.04166068956009951	0.021706720036723127	0.022073191598205304	0.0438878783734618	0.053400377014906464	0.08843434200223801	0.1022398110798815	0.12199180967472428	0.19997738114330987	0.2504904779903993	0.27326961808306816	0.3036741856639708	0.7919661985984442	1.3611299032722144	
The first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low-key character psychodrama like THE MINUS MAN but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest. There's a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted.	-1.6135209627407892	-1.1445082095706658	-1.1064012631132032	-0.9353924930578876	-0.7586096663571491	-0.523079171684756	-0.478050323858505	-0.46858484369795766	-0.3525643353093282	-0.3497259869278224	-0.34305382857871825	-0.31891222682308507	-0.29051008643521586	-0.1664749993564467	-0.06605709615113767	-0.0017811882923542029	0.2807359076105135	0.2960870113327235	0.3234148087773287	0.4557595445652326	0.5071170424637907	0.6134492052589197	0.6506765396046222	1.0038934244672189	1.6642825152171368	
Wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it's hopeless to help her patients. A young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and 'House of Games' may very well be the best con movie I've seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that's full of snappy dialogue, great one-liners, and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end. Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and Mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie, the film is in utter control of it's audience; and we are loving the con.<br /><br />*** out of ****	-1.489721884185973	-1.396706947426573	-1.1223730035382964	-0.9594335042260825	-0.8002315935424124	-0.5019407198449184	-0.3599038344700265	-0.26935795123959916	-0.23224101099198743	-0.23009305951290587	-0.15621558698415702	-0.09063567407673843	-0.04171798421992608	0.030856141590726388	0.06669417847147092	0.18835797662990236	0.24857408556636915	0.445326433708457	0.8356595761566629	0.8431484477820477	0.8845403220191353	1.1169245990335954	1.7230975507140531	1.8015079524156443	2.2389946198915225	
Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! This has got to be one of THE worse movies I've EVER seen! I do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but I swear I could make a better movie than this staring my pets! The acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as I watched it! I'm looking forward to the REAL movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don't have to stoop to watch this joke!	-4.152183407476153	-2.4463495206481123	-2.295490339635191	-2.2874804024306297	-1.7684481181490341	-1.2043720526950423	-1.1514765003626182	-0.5756011064737243	-0.43630482632896134	-0.30901337333037854	-0.2144313957618408	-0.19825521487802472	-0.00984836851863909	0.12070919202237605	0.45928539103050137	0.4938158056249199	0.49544534077343283	0.5391276727544541	0.5496658688452718	0.7077028876599162	0.7730295661665928	1.0025424398191105	1.1116895538236384	2.9430487891617005	4.646693629969066	
The DVD release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (from years after this film) basically is the cover art... and the back cover art... and the inside cover art... the same picture. Her name is prominently shown on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disk itself. She is the first name in the list of stars. Her biography is printed inside the case. This film must revolve around her character, right? WRONG! It is her first movie and she plays a minor role. After watching the movie, every role seems like a minor role. The character Dog actually displays some personality. Less than an hour after watching it, I don't even remember the names of many characters.<br /><br />Maybe if I watched it several more times, I could actually figure out the plot, but I don't think it would be worth the effort.<br /><br />Oh, wait, I just remembered a funny bit! Shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the "Doom-cam". Looks just like a first-person shooter game. Hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.<br /><br />I am generally not a person to be critical of movies, but this may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it.<br /><br />I'm just glad that the money we spent on this (used) went to charity.	-4.3064075743411205	-3.526935046471912	-2.740778449700749	-2.2775866809867873	-1.749206450936131	-0.9620929779933249	-0.954223634028928	-0.9011042019338037	-0.6626016577006948	-0.5004656454373637	-0.4646126255186074	-0.34712189550113165	-0.32467169629474035	-0.19847784953185876	-0.006020921979848715	0.05352664313187229	0.10878170899109639	0.24946380301772086	1.2204861675354586	1.46548487181129	2.015004356873255	2.424989823056107	2.7530177710794073	3.4041469059580023	5.434411250150706	
It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by today's standards, the film is interesting and provocative <br /><br />Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girl's school Therese is energetic, intelligent, and becomes a mentor for the innocent, naive, sweet Isabelle She guides her through a number of exotic experiences, including a trip through an exclusive brothel, into her first lesbian liaison, and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience <br /><br />The film does not exploit any sex, nor is there an abundance of nudity... The imagery is effective, but sometimes the camera lingers too long, and the story goes slowly <br /><br />The director, Radley Metzger, went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris He always has extremely detailed stories, good acting, and very high standards of cinematography...<br /><br />Artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas "Therese and Isabelle" was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism...	-0.7163412221409108	-0.2069850730730971	-0.20001912305187378	-0.14806139531058507	-0.13558034523336263	-0.12126373851409097	-0.10288123095576107	-0.09692740074407785	-0.042883309430352526	-0.0016120002791576013	0.018415176776157866	0.04085095945955293	0.0569472592825786	0.06828521068164768	0.17052062564216394	0.2243074013897994	0.2331761537944883	0.25056275761883967	0.2522805812890978	0.3209812533877471	0.4380323299489269	0.44889153311874996	0.4821400229591002	0.5492083453418528	0.584203710627329	
Clive Barker of Hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting.<br /><br />The make-up done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground. It was really a treat to see the quality of work.<br /><br />It wasn't particularly horrible, as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer.<br /><br />I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also. Nothing spectacular, but fair. This was only Anne Bobby's third film, and she was good also.<br /><br />The ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts, as did David Cronenberg.

Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.	-4.751427754214973	-3.7258863591817786	-1.9648534566002345	-1.7623901676768274	-1.2583506349799354	-0.3063954497216807	0.1332818626372603	0.2312889167140094	0.41892441168298833	0.5966272091772257	0.703523610031826	0.7589626371019961	0.8089090445003156	0.8286073263731507	0.8888172728452537	1.0376967998503563	1.0587661947909661	1.3136790421951101	1.425368707272079	1.6475907554629858	1.9085832424579898	2.455285051015625	2.6025244193385304	3.2275439371113324	4.903382487101161	
Ostensibly a story about the young child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at Albert Hall in London.<br /><br />The movie is rich in Hitchcockian incidents. A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to grill the innocent Stewart -- a doctor from Indiana -- a little too intensely to be merely idly curious. Later the Frenchman shows up in Arab disguise, a knife in his back, and whispers some information about the murder plot to Stewart. Stewart tells his wife -- Doris Day looking very saucy indeed -- but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life.<br /><br />Instead the couple try to track down the assassins, buy them off, and get their son back, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock has given us his usual tourist's eye view of the customs, locations, and food, to London. There is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set-to between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. The staff are more concerned about guarding their half-stuffed specimens than anything else, and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. In the course of the scuffle, Stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill, but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger, the action boosted along by Bernard Hermann's bumptious score. The scene ends with Stewart rushing out the door. Hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion's head gaping at the slammed door. There is also a running gag, well done, about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for things to be explained.<br /><br />There are two serious issues that are lightly touched on. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it ought to be, considered as a bourgeois ideal. She's been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known. And she's given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc. That's understandable in, say, a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right. It isn't delved into, but the edginess is noticeable, as it was not in the original version. It reminds me a little of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then-wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from entertaining the troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she gushed, "did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer?" "Seventy thousand," muttered Joe, former hero of the New York Yankees.<br /><br />The second problem is one of allegiance. Who is of greater social value? One's own young son? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability? Day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the Albert Hall. Her solution opts for allegiance to political stability, although her motives are problematic. Does she scream to save the ambassador's life, or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her? (Cf: Alec Guiness falling on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge on the River Kwai.") The photography is extremely good, and the settings can be menacing, even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of London. It's mid-day, and Stewart is alone and determined, but frightened too. There are footsteps echoing on Gulliver Street from someone, somewhere. Is he being followed? Is his life in danger? And where the hell is everybody who lives on this street? Hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him.<br /><br />The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut while being interviewed for Truffaut's otherwise laudatory book. Truffaut argued that the earlier version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional. No argument there.<br /><br />This is Hitchcock pretty much near his zenith.	-9.617524467436523	-6.750106316797483	-6.6134399281960095	-3.874359995903311	-3.261585441210481	-2.657382366117568	-1.2707534596845718	-1.2589552125700687	-1.2117109205881194	-1.2073592178884318	-0.8295408557365875	-0.09471553054405324	0.4523368857866489	0.6244666007022948	0.9390425553744707	1.0413543592898113	1.1280553089743757	1.2221436296770545	1.4661214761218897	2.2099038968719467	2.9437045253834357	3.4461624459593363	3.9781669824729207	5.895180394322965	12.310096154121194	
"The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1955) is Alfred Hitchcock's own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation in Morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder, espionage, assassinations and the worst of all, kidnapping of their 10-years-old son. The movie which Hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun. Stewart and Day have a good chemistry together. The film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense. <br /><br />The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like "Que Sera, Sera" did in "The Man Who Knew Too Much". <br /><br />Hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from Arthur Benjamin "Storm Cloud Cantata" for almost ten minutes while scene in London's Royal Albert Hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both, the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous.	-1.8040308085324706	-1.5235303640074547	-1.3106626065338463	-1.1045517669217109	-1.0778868376328192	-0.4667162511379307	-0.36660279149241426	-0.16116734922347728	0.09489428888980363	0.20305533708708126	0.2706211459768064	0.2921443571011347	0.367473478800388	0.3710615141917846	0.4174645474868575	0.5261700239831089	0.6369215650429817	0.6555122135755554	0.6740918819554067	0.8419234613696378	1.093921450717653	1.260338492376962	2.2532986075702226	2.3333546018590603	2.6948219572547405

Up until this new season I have been a big 'Little Mosque' fan. However, the new season had absolutely RUINED it.<br /><br />The new Christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. The new vicar ruins that premise and shows Christians in a very bad light.<br /><br />I am neither Christian or Muslim, but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend. Not any more.<br /><br />Just cancel it and be done with it. It's not worth watching any more.<br /><br />It might still be saved, but a lot of change would need to be made.<br /><br />Bring back the old format.	-2.253673936928384	-2.024148104362237	-1.237842407754541	-0.7250090670889622	-0.7158123671706689	-0.7086203341910888	-0.6156348376914369	-0.5907631517223748	-0.551147483727498	-0.30111236117339135	-0.19972990892686862	-0.16898146269297512	-0.06434048365557808	0.099130982256523	0.25157234604580625	0.3005087631065956	0.315972635083013	0.5410318195985949	0.8071520102486668	0.877951387039584	0.9876835814700817	1.0432905586586456	1.3424652281850191	1.6578980510573447	2.974366075395018	
Stupid, mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche race car which runs on decades-old gasoline sludge, driven by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as the runaway techno-wiz who can McGyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously, and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society. As moronic as it sounds. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film.	-2.007696441003231	-1.2416951096228495	-1.2185863275039817	-1.1492944189552516	-0.9750017625420258	-0.7144174235403378	-0.5123652461654843	-0.4725063847586077	-0.39737972335223243	-0.3944047101909325	-0.3608959849571974	-0.1509700087405515	-0.1505196955137751	-0.09178071595030694	0.05879838918952507	0.23530634701181907	0.429892553982579	0.464021303689124	0.46528785969025677	0.5218373562134891	0.538165781651251	0.6480621164748919	0.7893739349217452	1.142535685487816	1.8919096794840584	
This movie had me going. The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of lone survivors, band together, and plan to take out the zombies. DEAD WRONG! It's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge. As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved. Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation.<br /><br />First off, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies but mindless, debatable intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies. Sure the eating and killing is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question, "why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines?" I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much, it's an insult and as for scarynot even.	-6.6192873645606225	-2.9597278319479914	-2.9189223009396006	-2.774755507220486	-2.1702255196761104	-2.1487680689725988	-2.091864824809303	-0.9427469119523746	-0.5112887364737895	-0.48987298527021267	-0.2283653248522709	-0.013064176262775354	0.2143175122079217	0.22693988281936645	0.24921120411578246	0.3497662749885522	0.49910940189290876	0.7710616491286513	0.8542744691325552	0.9498196050356557	1.207810388036375	1.3866907882417754	2.8682852984441474	3.227192948131401	7.638046061820433	
I grew up with this as my all-time favorite film. The special effects are incredible for the era, and won awards. I can remember the dialogue as if I'd heard it yesterday. It is simply a great, timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, who is cinema history's best. Sabu is the Thief. Conrad Veidt is the grand villain. I have a copy within reach, for the next trip down memory lane. Whoa there! Rex Ingram wants out of his genii bottle!	-3.5264327940245472	-2.8104973714333426	-1.3995564619597514	-1.3260983625102534	-1.2967925063445729	-0.6725236612792435	-0.17545694963900388	-0.08852400614286365	-0.004756230559408287	0.2896218995984423	0.3170157069928919	0.38936751604797587	0.4284106362728993	0.6761986011735983	0.7125594054623001	0.8141880934280898	1.050616155996571	1.0744899912829895	1.1235368665977643	1.2985447543895408	1.391438764949055	1.6851468552762332	1.986284522384029	2.440522755725711	3.6788016050370618	
Imagine every stereotypical, overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters. Throw in a mix of "period" music and wailing electric guitars during the "rumble" scenes. Then pass the time trying to figure out (or care) which of the Deuces is going to be killed in the (anti)climactic final rumble.<br /><br />I'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, kiddie musical, or Oscar-nomination vehicle. But bringing something new or interesting to the street-gang tragedy genre might've been nice.	-1.6868712227264664	-1.1053346711461751	-0.6973732301475886	-0.6942026463975745	-0.44647257570776144	-0.4331729202035065	-0.40105272601062447	-0.2880728012056001	-0.26745599902477213	-0.20151290595480123	-0.12382135910305392	-0.05331171322636263	0.005846550006512137	0.04285599909015002	0.08393749940316975	0.1610236925325522	0.19093508726890024	0.3221538818541938	0.35242338793182637	0.36283952850403245	0.4084951945938283	0.5407641427277579	0.6402548164812863	1.1295175922232323	2.1801200164365504	
I first viewed "They Died With There Boots On",about 1970 and though it has been many years since,this film and its impression remain.the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic.When I first saw this film I knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some.I felt then as I even feel now that the Silver Screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone The Life of George Armstrong Custer,however the Director Raoul Walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when I watched a semi-documentary with other great directors like Vincent Mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the Hollywood mind set.This is what I considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable.Yet, there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well.Custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of...34.Much has been made of Custer's final class ranking,but of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy with him in 1857,half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day,June 24,1861.It is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of George Armstrong Custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the Sargeant on Duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident"His squadron would follow him to hell,"Your at attention Sargeant,reprimands Tape.If Iam not mistaken when Flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that Custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attaché to not only Sheridan,but Hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the Army of The Potomac under General George McClellan.There is some truth to the audacity attributed to Custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack ,"young Custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned Confederates.As a lone Union Soldier surrounded by rebels,Custers audacity shone through.He accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers,including a rebel captain.Yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first Confederate battle flag taken by the Army of the Potomac.This notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise."Robert L.Bateman-Armchair General.There is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to George Armstrong Custer,the story is good Hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes.Though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that Tom Custer was to lose his life at the "Little Big Horn" only a few feet from where George Custer was to die as well.They were brothers and Tom Custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice in his military career.The list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that Custers indeed was an active young officer.He was not with Union forces at either Chancellorsville or for that matter Fredericksburg however he was with them at the Battle of Antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to Captain by General McClellan but that was not to last as McClellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that The Army of The Potomac had the means,and the information(discovered wrapped around some cigars was General Lee's plans to split his forces)and yet he failed to act for some 17 hours.It can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when McClellan failed to act President Lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result. Custers greatest victory may of in fact come at Gettysburg,Pa.His forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at Gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a Jeb Stuart Led Cavalry of some 6,000 rebels with but a force of 2,300.I Think the heroics at Gettysburg by Custer are worth some discussion.There is speculation had in the movie that Custers appointment was a blunder, well you better guess again because not only did Custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the Governor of the State of Michigan which by the way was relatively new to the Union Cause and where preparing to form Cavalry regiments.Though Custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that Gold Braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe.The truth be told Custers defense at Gettysburg prohibited Jeb Stuart from having lunch at the Unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank.This action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with Picketts Charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success.It was a critical victory and Custer was at his bravest and best.His men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it.	-3.288550361358347	-1.8432681804029651	-1.6824366492150915	-1.2953173627933225	-1.2807826709621197	-1.1426297109035568	-1.0726096366828364	-0.3375775682174874	-0.2507501589087335	-0.19657650393934661	-0.19623435404823264	-0.02287239047052611	-0.007101747423862596	-9.469407399854274E-4	0.039238720949864546	0.040132463731829285	0.08848359094533788	0.2698557949534634	0.3807050572172477	0.5586713602210855	0.6212487011929355	0.9082969036178153	0.9289072722909852	1.9198196180012799	3.4068344655292164	
It's not a movie, but an experience!<br /><br />Not the usual eye candy I thought it would be. Too many things are happening at once, your senses almost couldn't handle it. A product of cutting-edge technology (we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3D glasses on and off to decipher the magic), the music is great (it's a concert!), the Disney characters are in it (and you get to BE part of their world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting--I know this is beginning to sound like an advertisement--but it really is that awesome! Beats Christmas in bringing out the kid in you!<br /><br />This attraction alone already makes going to Disney all worth it. ;)	-1.4060466566238448	-1.2298576565806616	-0.9252047648476572	-0.8477925821157815	-0.7210670140995624	-0.3688345767865001	-0.31161535337387947	-0.27276143045509904	-0.12202161681586647	-0.016562145876624884	0.023491253431994638	0.050278482523039916	0.056080442824066476	0.07552495470535832	0.08441766166370929	0.13326703687614078	0.15831661807369135	0.32023257068229005	0.39044195112694186	0.6219417609832819	0.6782123986504818	0.8009736658799133	1.0749192709912074	1.3032066184938558	2.1755861021634724	
Producers Golan and Globus should have been ashamed to release this piece of trash publicly. I know this is gonna sound cliched, but compared to this, the first "Hercules" of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic! This "sequel" is moronic, cheap, unredeemable, childish, phony, inept and BADLY ACTED. A landmark in bad cinema, and one of the few, few movies I've seen that REALLY deserve the lowest possible rating: no stars!	-3.21507369120892	-2.0330344526144994	-2.0136417194864924	-1.6937938345895334	-1.5206422017071253	-0.9772904801630554	-0.48917868759404937	-0.4349019259589942	-0.28372780341331233	-0.2460819264217457	-0.2250147363684452	-0.21237296762562682	-0.15605182066273815	-0.04830902383850755	0.0690726034819691	0.11615339938577075	0.29264517893668845	0.3665687947503057	0.3671506629483394	0.37292605395770867	0.53692679896027	0.88407059621551	1.5560091422051516	2.026409230360465	3.3749470479195907	
China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was helmed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Sadly he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight-to-video action flick.<br /><br />China O'Brien returns home to help out her dad. He's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help. So she returns home and restores order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to topple Mister Big and his evil cronies?<br /><br />If you're a big Cynthia Rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you. I only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. Why didn't Raymond Chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director?<br /><br />Recommended.	-3.9568902411025673	-2.2703147431745387	-1.56645851371863	-1.4546131904435429	-1.432299418107793	-1.179722101061165	-1.1015350793200223	-0.9510672651304433	-0.5247974929513615	-0.5104092945479107	-0.19707077381792862	0.08472248205050835	0.19126924668469888	0.30269741032870245	0.31482114949673995	0.40161426515159593	0.4164941324033054	0.42085086512560577	0.5049870769656892	0.9377852007248139	0.9873369856667104	1.1486097612857316	1.1901534274863321	1.9695283791126963	4.924255939208835	
"It appears that many critics find the idea of a Woody Allen drama unpalatable." And for good reason: they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman. And let's not kid ourselves: critics were mostly supportive of Allen's Bergman pretensions, Allen's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding. What I don't get is this: why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman, but the contemporaneous Brian DePalma was excoriated for "ripping off" Hitchcock in his suspense/horror films? In Robin Wood's view, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. I would have to agree with that.	-2.575896120134617	-1.6086375799548651	-1.385625961597929	-0.7556828973719805	-0.6834147635736636	-0.6154852634395608	-0.4945687811383088	-0.29258065555750534	-0.2885748386883891	-0.20249543614880727	-0.09273290368556107	-0.05259915759551588	0.01706993492869687	0.032214365338729074	0.12517326248743088	0.1823597349650611	0.22148801517531963	0.38230804741018776	0.43631111213970264	0.5407792064969741	0.5814208553377365	0.6670090284733836	1.0360299598774734	1.7760880802828374	3.00318545829397	
There is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. The movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (I, for one, was sure it was the teacher. In fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. I guess the point of that is that "rape is omnipresent. You never know who it is going to be".) Ms. Beller is luminous as always (yet see KB discussion board for my qualification of this statement). Like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point. Unless you are really curious to find out what happens to Phillip. Blythe Danner, as the mom, is in the role she was born to play: the fretting, over-protective mom. Some good 70s scenes for 70s fans. (The dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark-stained beams, barrels, oak and cork). A must for Beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s High School melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.	-3.826823288704615	-2.3240822561540293	-2.168594962914923	-1.8356912537644772	-1.2749225845154095	-0.8828117107127429	-0.7527525942219152	-0.7194752782180354	-0.33961015172802184	-0.11187517631155644	-0.04014292707065947	-0.0033752489160487273	0.003601685108249465	0.14913217223117486	0.18339966603831265	0.24752111545047645	0.38749716243862103	0.5989591934366983	0.6565974235503524	0.6838708406777941	0.9329744155896993	1.4601652126694737	1.6267633015669887	2.560276394929846	4.594393937267109	
Made after QUARTET was, TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham. Here the three stories are THE VERGER, MR. KNOW-IT-ALL, and SANITORIUM. The first two are comic (THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good pay-off), and the last more serious (as health issues are involved). Again the author introduces the film and the stories.<br /><br />James Hayter, soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick, is the hero in THE VERGER. He holds this small custodial-type job in a church, but the new Vicar (Michael Hordern) is an intellectual snob. When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him. Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife (Kathleen Harrison) he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop. He has a good eye, and his store thrives. Soon he has a whole chain of stores. When his grandchild is christened by Hordern, the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex-Verger. The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments. I'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.<br /><br />According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada (Nigel Patrick) on a cruise. In MR. KNOW-IT-ALL Kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing type from the Middle East who is on a business trip (regarding jewelry) by steamship. His state-room mate is Mr. Grey (the ever quiet and proper Wilfred Hyde-White) who is somewhat, silently disapproving of Max. Max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ship's entertainment. At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non-Maugham story and film CHINA SEAS (1935), as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake (after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real). I won't describe the way Max rises to the occasion.<br /><br />SANITORIUM is the longest segment. Roland Culver plays "Ashenden" (the fictional alter-ego of Maugham - a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcock's THE SECRET AGENT). Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health. He finds a remarkable crew of people, including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman, John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is "at war" with Currie, Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness. Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions. The last, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.<br /><br />It was a dandy follow-up to the earlier QUARTET, and well worth watching.	-5.449105725603854	-4.3316535409134875	-3.1732473378324357	-3.015795120723708	-1.4131405867566258	-1.410974316212451	-1.347828326036773	-1.3379213254712201	-0.8011946239952542	-0.7935918552843745	-0.12063537620716526	-0.06759445994065497	-0.0630598440917312	-0.05027882118906363	0.334219116263527	0.3419073187898613	1.3037230265675412	1.3476060057469894	1.7132473510019657	1.7350870313173172	2.0907379488255606	2.141238114848463	4.431475776686885	4.814034769222424	8.407457900211563	
For connoisseurs of bad movies, Galaxina is a true gem. With truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes involving the Harley Davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.<br /><br />Sadly, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, I suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.<br /><br />Bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!	-1.692657549734698	-1.596585758647799	-1.5334972114496122	-1.5013456965937022	-1.2857824525533261	-1.2565578568297933	-1.2220209035886662	-1.0468603657415123	-0.8988185283827134	-0.361815280621024	-0.1501439051569887	-0.07933773832713195	-0.03039344498940627	0.014569323923972893	0.05395949477773945	0.2657445718278411	0.45943364229594574	0.5182259043685806	0.6845027054813589	0.7486208119734195	1.1484242492342622	1.2831142523900148	1.2915739015637795	2.0937751209713107	2.731964236179257	
This really should deserve a "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I watched this show for ages, and the show jumped the shark around series 7. This episode, however, is proof that the show has jumped the shark. It's writing is lazy, absurd, self-indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like Beavis and Butthead.<br /><br />It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun -- Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy, Count of Monte Cristo -- all "fun" movies that are not to be taken seriously. However, there is such thing as ridiculous as in "this is the worst thing I've ever seen." And indeed, this is the worst episode of Stargate I've ever seen. It's absolutely dreadful, and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement.<br /><br />Makes me want to sell all of my stargate props, most seriously.	-5.854537850039312	-3.247891466482508	-2.9795489379563698	-2.78231247081675	-2.7641872878428306	-1.652340778453444	-1.5443815409552917	-0.677039542552583	-0.47266509431615494	-0.2733794315789866	-0.15135289116997017	0.025625244314979798	0.048394094750511735	0.20577654926018582	0.30500297733444354	0.3572794469738794	0.3808544862726002	0.39799482844862166	0.6101166701246781	0.6905281601479955	0.7777000830626615	0.9982363795751681	2.2207670408398075	3.551100307669828	6.000274421254952	
One reasons why they call the 80's, "The Awesome 80's" is quality television. Shows like the Wonder Years, War of the Worlds (the series), V, Amazing Stories, and many more have always left an impression to each "fortunate" one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself. To top that, here comes Monsters! A series quite unique of its own, and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters. May it be the good, the bad, and the morbid.<br /><br />If you're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. <br /><br />Even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness, it's indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity. I guarantee, because I'm 23 :).<br /><br />Be sure NOT to miss this!<br /><br />Although, it's a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember...	-2.3512741834580875	-2.2616090491333014	-1.486720286058806	-1.1291919800064318	-1.098872147942137	-0.9832886892714694	-0.5348918324494283	-0.2305410721924563	-0.12281753125948328	-0.04681129592002075	0.05457191715462116	0.06429005012330404	0.17389997318730308	0.1958233852823344	0.3024464992363229	0.3839857330392191	0.39451323191766385	0.5194085680589803	0.7673591755918604	1.1731513533273317	1.5638302268853999	1.6351724435304944	2.2191111949301994	2.5616499620464177	3.990002727189613

As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah!<br /><br />Theology-wise, puh-leeze!!! God is still made to look and think like humans...and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. Being the lightweight comedy it is, it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /><br />There are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, audiences - from Christians to atheists.- got something out of this besides a few laughs, such as what prayer should really be all about. Kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good-hearted film that should offend very few.	-2.4565281543085953	-1.471285153858225	-1.4374442864875259	-1.2549443581425408	-1.078735204819022	-0.26239113541334924	-0.2543044198951025	-0.2230613098903999	-0.1563407456531103	-0.14949530362468638	-0.08910972821852331	-0.08252077331578421	0.049492448786652016	0.0801271142871724	0.33590267450804234	0.4801099174069559	0.5187524840873617	0.5478418068805626	0.5853274350522717	0.6134718172041698	0.7665660531519258	1.2846894823634292	1.5538257606592247	2.2465391167116775	2.565633900731222	
OK, I normally don't add comments on movies, but I finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh*t and riddled with incompetence that I just had to warn people about. Blackwater Valley Exorcist is loosely about a wife-beating/pederast/priest and this podunk family of horse freaks, and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed. Along with a heroic god shunning Mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism, the wife-beating/ pederast/priest manage to save the day, but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him. All in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless (I could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie)sh*t I've ever seen. Any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn.	-2.4765610900661237	-1.1981099173087595	-1.0993857116152264	-1.0509769573273653	-1.0014041533607605	-0.6756981677722045	-0.4590444675149722	-0.39098765912269906	-0.34464866618668	-0.18338589156763696	-0.12120028453831025	-0.10853862583072953	-0.0870874169266562	-0.05510082506860907	0.04890938546506914	0.04945818727487425	0.16652785027194847	0.3260278858699997	0.3463211070415764	0.5147687487064809	0.5652599889173063	0.617179224249055	0.6678319141771369	1.2200694160921746	2.5016977655612775	
I first saw this film in the theater way back in the 40s when I was a kid and always remembered the ending. There is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed. Something just resonates with them. This is one of those films and I agree with another reviewer who said Fritz Lang should have directed more westerns. To add to it I have always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young stars in what I consider my favorite movie if I have to name just one, not an easy thing to do. That film is Northwest Passage. It led me to the superb historical novels of Kenneth Roberts. Western Union likewise led me to reading Zane Grey's novel which, in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases where I like the movie better than the novel. Not that Grey's novel is a bad one; I just like the movie story better. The movie in no way resembles the novel. It is a completely different tale, one of the biggest departures from a book I have seen.<br /><br />I can't add much to the other reviews except to say I agree with many of them. I, too, wish it would be released on DVD.

The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984 you might have caught it on the Movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84). But it has a dated look to it. Maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984. Now on the story, it has some kind of back story, a forest fire back in the 1940's leaves a lot of Gypsies burned to death. But one of their children survive (our monster) so flash forward to present day which would be 1978, we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the Monster. The tag line for this picture claims ITS NOT HUMAN, AND ITS GOT AN AXE, but an Axe was only used in these first two killings. Now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20's camping. We all know they are the Prey, and the monster knocks them of one by one. For an 80 minute movie it seems longer. We also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins. Overall for being out into an 80-'s horror movie it looks way more 70's than ever. Hey the Prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short.. It does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end, and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him. Side note, the monster has gone on to star in the Addams family movies in the 1990's..	-7.72306912756128	-3.0713565257852418	-2.852533778587952	-2.4185520762750468	-2.1402222657901584	-1.4702738161929865	-1.20151388441783	-1.1849687269440259	-1.0362573100997041	-0.7336717273450768	-0.23279571784970832	-0.22529148771776736	-0.1621092024042779	-0.007641194555584541	0.015213144575486448	0.17614149958243439	0.4165966826360006	0.501262957270169	0.8398593834530927	0.9786499230538286	1.0018514920193968	1.307916752636749	2.9334207345893404	3.4950197628613497	7.368355521799736	
Excellent cast, story line, performances. Totally believable. I realize the close knit group that exemplifies the Marine Corps. But this movie brought fear to my heart. The marines let principles be damned. It seems that this film was based on real life incidents. It shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment. Anne Heche was utterly convincing. Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering. And Eric Stoltz as her attorney was so deft balancing his loyalty to the Corp but also his loyalty to his client, while high above on his tightrope. He knew what his true course of action had to be. But he was pulled apart by his immersion in the Marine tradition, loyalty to the Corps above all else. I sat riveted to the TV screen. All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.	-3.5686008732006007	-2.814027241739669	-2.205340108088941	-1.264886614434918	-0.6695868764976859	-0.5077189301503047	-0.29837798119129794	-0.2537542139150931	-0.20944242106872896	-0.1537690060990866	-0.10441177678256447	-0.055904955766844164	0.018663620913223017	0.2537489955702549	0.7431156206755737	0.8823977490501255	0.9577714301387623	1.0263800392848246	1.2285955009412013	1.255898182389648	1.263189151784278	1.3332756020477634	2.4454374137859167	2.957780361175479	4.066736562394996	
When tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as "The King of Masks," becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate.<br /><br />His warmth and humanity, tho, find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930's.<br /><br />He takes his new, 7 year old companion, onto his straw houseboat, to live with his prized and beautiful monkey, "General," only to discover that the he-child is a she-child.<br /><br />His life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man.<br /><br />There are many stories inside this one...many people are touched, and the culture of China opens itself for our Western eye to observe. Thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this DVD behind with a dry eye.<br /><br />The technical transfer itself is not that great, as I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.	-1.4788168897941463	-1.465367234107816	-1.1571662126686664	-1.1390919162004747	-0.9062826658934818	-0.6520880018362061	-0.4810054512947782	-0.2267197805532058	-0.21144971025041637	-0.10702976071801834	-0.03638557765085554	0.016248329133288473	0.04047238169833861	0.06805573493183134	0.26103216491470294	0.30365175694769286	0.3645556702990578	0.42085043161901164	0.44846618892029666	0.8518048149446373	0.9046761018627043	1.060015083512054	1.4201523648354595	1.7226585424806136	2.661822796542007	
I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. It is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic. It's more like a "how to" guide for something that can't be done anymore. I was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.	-2.818180867301251	-1.9602791050132802	-1.4188575010123412	-1.273571296695338	-1.2231389464560152	-0.9745188904110085	-0.8722154816378155	-0.49980736403595494	-0.3712162280086654	-0.1244394573881058	-0.11678519737772201	0.025897821993789785	0.047692449031489496	0.15848170912579937	0.17242127494600448	0.2715382885382802	0.28652720053987907	0.29967609248705335	0.44489114179613953	0.4795290846801915	0.5857079188263622	0.632850690391025	1.0952897921955493	1.8936680939327912	3.3984406977820556	
Spoilers: This movie has it's problems, but in the end it gets the message across. I liked it because it ends the way things really do. The nice guy tries and tries, gets his heart broken several times, but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending. It ends the way such things always end, or at least always have in my own and friends' experiences. Anyone who thinks that the ending to this isn't how it really happens, as the first comment seemed to, believing that the girl would come around, realize she's dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesn't care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than I. I give it 7/10, extra points simply because it wasn't afraid to end on a down note, give no real resolution, just the main character left heartbroken, confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before.	-1.878781056929776	-1.0884804094989828	-1.0820691418508308	-1.042181751065358	-0.9015165243422154	-0.8885258271396212	-0.42862900724561304	-0.3737231040419956	-0.2043983918254579	-0.20357771715924722	-0.18695150572669664	-0.14085499237381574	-0.07335930069763537	-0.05910963106785455	-0.013218864673746923	0.08260009413851535	0.12437187551724702	0.1823651073015837	0.30206444475326644	0.32287011686031697	0.4487198797082808	0.44929505285799265	0.5631422905750377	1.2706701417544102	2.2077684136380724	
I don't think I will include any spoilers but If I do, I can cover my butt. "The Last American Virgin" came in a time were such teenage coming of age/high school sex romps were the rave. Films such as "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's " (1981) were making mucho money. Yet it is the "Last American Virgin" the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations. It is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity. The go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous ones (older woman with jealous boyfriend) and the convenient ones (luring their high school female counterparts). The movie has a lot of funny moments, and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star, it is worth remembering for a fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. By today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a NC-17 rating, but is a well told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain,while love might be right in front of us. It is a little piece of 80s Americana and worth having in your movie collection.	-2.295312486427065	-2.0809276453891186	-1.4117136552557177	-1.0698388688351401	-0.8521515672627383	-0.47647164128838815	-0.2733466579453375	-0.1824375929177867	-0.10525863527027249	-0.0940986832178021	-0.06454111074040647	0.038729805063852284	0.10487890956352366	0.1516821999988017	0.16751207042276542	0.1781078799054181	0.18055059626361253	0.31211415945444065	0.3609708841807709	0.6770373952950763	0.7239332557920803	1.5084758694280895	1.5471233293926343	1.8586340518362565	3.659481059397308	
A lot of people seemed to have liked the film, so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review. But after sitting through 96 minutes of it, I feel I have to do so. Where the heck is the plot in this film?! I must have missed it, I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened. Sure the ending was "somewhat shocking" but they didn't build up to it. I forgot who was who half of the time, so they didn't really develop the characters. The acting was so-so, most of the time it was believable, but I was able to see through it most of the time. So... without giving anything away, I must say that unless you like the actors in the film, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be mistaken, but I just didn't understand why there was so little, or too much of the film. I can't decide which one that would be, so I say judge for yourselves. I don't even know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and all... <br /><br />Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I feel like that's too high really, I am staying with my vote up at the top.	-5.276839506582143	-2.6405693156894117	-2.494810272977746	-2.419857446566591	-2.404789809985184	-2.0031309359418583	-1.7853703155435763	-0.8326856623598868	-0.5915985725560235	-0.5098411273296015	-0.407525678182394	-0.30197523257359876	-0.21645556201157634	-0.11137791778870723	-0.08554902955108773	0.112785798767758	0.18573540460804486	0.34318325314206566	0.6688599418024435	0.7661976869544682	1.431369763912719	1.5368875664254602	1.7302075923535696	3.2632891916958924	5.827998554837142	
I have never read the book"A wrinkle in time". To be perfectly honesty, after seeing the movie, do I really want to? Well, I shouldn't be reviewing this movie i'll start off with that. Next i'll say that the TV movie is pretty forgettable. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what happens in it. I told you it was forgettable. To be perfectly honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin".<br /><br />How do I describe a TV movie? I have never written a review for one before. Well, i'll just say that they usually have some celebrities. A wrinkle in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard(Or Woodward, I am not sure), the Oscar winner. <br /><br />The film has cheesy special effects, a mildly interesting plot, scenes that make you go "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go"WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They usually aren't good. As is this one. A wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster. To top it off, you'll most likely forget about it the second it's over. Well, maybe not the second it's over. But within a few minutes.<br /><br />A wrinkle in time:*/****	-8.925669663200456	-4.179080907259857	-3.651387433819536	-3.0972091027706488	-2.7948431049336713	-2.42496610853856	-2.379699233473576	-2.079228546435629	-0.9838968750371053	-0.16493946969167228	0.07893565733625264	0.25346375751739153	0.38067354056543967	0.44340025616798745	0.5480390685057817	0.7542467369161958	0.9234502490565287	0.9629314843093955	1.044285192801094	1.1890296402821219	1.3301680747775564	1.610912969854825	3.696497316406576	4.452358709885337	10.179309958741467	
I love this show!<br /><br />Every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is. I am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science (fiction?) show in the history of film/TV. There are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion. Its amazing, season after season the show gets better and better.<br /><br />I've been a fan of MacGyver since i was 5 (19 now) and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all time star Richard Dean Anderson. Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.<br /><br />Back when i first saw Stargate the movie, i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks, then hearing a TV show would spin from it i got really excited, but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over.<br /><br />Though, I'm disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead. <br /><br />Id say though that it turned out just fine.

The fight scenes were great. Loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side. It was the ending that I hated. I was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back. But to travel all that way just to start over? Are you kidding me? 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise, they abandon technology? No way. Sure they were eating paper and rationing food, but that is over. They can live like humans again. They only have one good doctor. What are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth... yea right. No one would have made that choice.	-4.658392299027685	-2.0899144842932644	-2.004668834308281	-1.6700735073436996	-1.3123138269555183	-0.8654342585782986	-0.7579137508093492	-0.6254217385013838	-0.5618975433817772	-0.4209827493484538	-0.22508929505682757	-0.111478605805901	0.2478687592810773	0.32788720128165527	0.33597950888967915	0.3762035584279305	0.41109947792626	0.4749593305820429	0.5652270775197854	0.5817913302641731	0.6259350621671909	0.7881374394182779	1.8434023669572572	2.3504834267167527	5.020347330539971	
In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, starts the gang after his brother OD's on "junk". He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge.<br /><br />The movie didn't really do it for me. The "Good Guys" weren't any more good than the "Bad Guys". Very little was shown to suggest that the Deuces really cared for the community. I suppose the writers were going for realism here, but I just didn't care which side won. None of the characters were likable, or even capable of drawing my sympathy.<br /><br />On the plus side the courtship between Annie and Bobby had some snappy dialog, and the acting overall was well done.	-3.103737746245544	-2.063801650263313	-1.4080305506860404	-1.0767826955509132	-0.9943748547856848	-0.9733750664602292	-0.7750344806302051	-0.6308741583748693	-0.46017977453665215	-0.38036653357244754	-0.3757038932329928	0.006154404700734009	0.010712139624970272	0.042669807025756956	0.06231458670416551	0.15327809347744825	0.3278388668312777	0.7404370838861728	0.753719192920364	0.7855814981529241	0.8486710323530534	0.877802283540078	0.8945928059370977	1.727172259393147	3.357815588610137	
This film, was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that, unlike some other films I liked in that period The Thief of Bagdad has held on to it's quality while I grew up. This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. The only drawback there is, is that one can not see past the bad' effects (compared to the effects nowadays) like one could when one was a child. I remembered nothing of those effects, of course it had been about ten years since I'd seen this film, when I was about eleven years old. Who then watches effects? One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. Coming to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones films are quite a like this film. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old. All of that is mainly due to the great story, the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors. In that department Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. Great film and although an 'oldie', definitely a goldie'. I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday.<br /><br />8 out of 10	-4.1824949015443185	-3.9958048068389953	-2.116536676568901	-1.7562086853379166	-1.6992547110789349	-0.33626472618351616	-0.2535458392069546	0.09355805859793549	0.33524846614294684	0.38225456660929125	0.5151871990998835	0.5472600597140593	0.6021171621094559	0.7029822908239534	0.8631189989513027	1.0677062248041576	1.1491317494935596	1.3106650008297973	1.3438577451391367	1.5485991250067443	1.5639317851860448	1.8860165685925299	3.4095216552018517	4.737736440137288	5.048487247342647	
I had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now An Unexpected Love. It's not really worth looking for but I was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on Lifetime. Everything's pretty restrained and you don't really get an idea of who these characters are so, as a viewer, I wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the storyline. I guess I'm not the target audience for this but I'm not sure who is. Everything's muted and soft focus and earth tones...nothing's very interesting. I had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it's handled so discreetly that I was disappointed. Rent Personal Best instead.	-3.2118831811115527	-1.5939951684269293	-1.5278553999424125	-1.4811024972866813	-1.384217863087179	-0.9183509256791453	-0.6918942075567999	-0.47447437988955704	-0.3435480742289695	-0.3051548204229078	-0.1686696271654643	-0.1299866237420363	-0.12139959679752356	-0.11947260016398385	-0.107319736721743	0.03476749640693559	0.03690148858860616	0.10532333946730588	0.5145367366403069	0.521431428151313	0.6334607390954299	0.9931786458477394	1.1151541257532924	1.9635646028347737	3.6375091105027555	
Uneven Bollywood drama. Karisma Kapoor is excellent as an Indian woman in Canada who marries a friend (Sanjay Kapoor), has a child, and then visits his family in India only to find they are terrorist warlords. Drama and tragedy ensue, and the film becomes a kind of NOT WITHOUT MY BABY styled thriller. Film is compelling, its few song/dance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of Bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film's drama, at least once we've left the comforting confines of their Canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is enjoyably provocative, if ultimately misplaced as well. Likewise, the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happy-go-lucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce, and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about Rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with. His throw-away comic-book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama. The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord, and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his long-suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film's best scenes; Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjay's sisters in India, and very pleasing eye candy. But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious ad-libs. The directorial style of writer/director Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good. The musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble (too bad little if any of that made it onto SHAKTI's soundtrack cd, but Bollywood hasn't yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums, at least not in most cases). But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoor's film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes. Despite the unevenness of much of the picture, Karisma's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures. In a strange way, also, I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I'd noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE, both of which I'd seen just prior, although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism-controlled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal China's Tang Dynasty  whose self-serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.	-3.908847457139659	-3.2338322850837247	-3.051199331437364	-2.1732476460736505	-1.989430236199411	-1.7230367259211734	-1.0376201649521806	-0.6302482567680379	-0.5886524444762058	-0.3461897137624475	-0.04768507080067015	0.10514897992081873	0.3026584273421227	0.33573903459363635	0.5037777667263803	0.7063844597337723	0.9004956901749347	0.919714197596708	0.9532875885155679	1.0046811042502561	1.14134367521657	1.79003463805663	2.1788539362568553	4.400208882923103	6.796159177876391	
A typical Lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify Lanza's MGM contract at the time.<br /><br />As reported by member Lastliberal (above) Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off (and sometimes on) camera. In addition, his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable. After doing their second (and last) film together, "Toast of New Orleans", the normally quiet Grayson stormed into Louie B. Mayer's office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with Lanza again  period. Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM then Lanza, so Grayson's statement stuck. Grayson went on to star in a number of widely received (and far more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the "real people" in the audiences.	-3.2515588005684584	-1.606105042865741	-1.5615397851632924	-1.4543761523763141	-1.2720477685312328	-0.7169945203214215	-0.486458010854641	-0.4681157912854563	-0.459334673182054	-0.40081909650947456	-0.1302326030999666	-0.08305668917957	-0.016444221193397612	-0.005237228182612963	0.10786837280428295	0.11122047364108067	0.29829771405395433	0.4332858727138781	0.4703505556523699	0.5222046996976868	0.6370567812638118	0.6577859644964722	0.9128452115040854	1.778840490878427	3.5529756025418355	
Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home "My Wrongs..." (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes"). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.<br /><br />The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life", by Peter Capaldi.	-6.098439684494182	-3.646531546846675	-3.599958545248588	-3.2882488508602616	-3.24718232914622	-1.485695361532734	-1.2504539162837742	-0.8526179705274899	-0.42120544384593034	-0.19975206756900604	-0.16569631065681062	-0.1548683756741291	0.0609994234765512	0.10308938766422945	0.24903387335273774	0.2984253117877045	0.4173931649822095	0.4983982193006829	0.5550219688925182	0.968955730843613	1.0228870881686034	1.4942525979990577	1.9479197609757852	4.03954385472783	7.203204817193236	
The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods with Somewhere in the City. This hilarious farce, I believe, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami pokes fun at New York society by creating the believable, eccentric, and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them. Peter Stormare's performance as a gay Shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh-ability of self-centered ambition. Sandra Bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight, self-obsessed therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance immensely especially since I haven't really been a very big fan until now. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti, and Bulle Ogier round out an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With a cameo appearance by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, the revolutionary momma's boy, Somewhere in the City entertains without missing a beat.	-4.102852353848091	-1.8843637262791784	-1.3669912577014647	-1.1944509020030258	-1.0675676041681756	-0.19234166927389607	-0.18762093688486448	-0.14161395255912124	-0.11532414943411429	-0.004392002753131438	0.44488579444042853	0.616650496285939	0.6467234320279833	0.9722283681443956	0.9948500715672168	1.0162293580075497	1.0652567922414307	1.078017632453294	1.1274295140954762	1.3279871717246086	1.3647541296844903	1.886351330860761	2.0114727280174183	2.402271242994295	3.6911600144209284	
The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans aren't as they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time. Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined? <br /><br />Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought. Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap opera-ish 70s made-for-TV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be. The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there. The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit"man"? Yeah, right! It's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked David Jansen. The movie also lacks any pace. Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had. With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made-for-TV movie. The lone highlight for me was the voice-over work from the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss listening to. The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest.<br /><br />Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start. So even though I've only rated Superdome a 2/10, I'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.	-6.966488320117616	-3.992710114700712	-3.9867664288567317	-3.8533173971359047	-2.9093147807116218	-2.5348186030801587	-2.2549218955909107	-0.6914900320597448	-0.14414890661676621	-0.12741167638257453	-0.12489684844660051	0.14125317448187957	0.28652042307362097	0.35143072981307416	0.46152410257918497	0.6481997634697619	0.9558888921885109	1.0157910320678794	1.236975040685297	1.598985518339578	1.8537179529462755	1.8999326804499497	2.6584516500297166	4.939908862445838	9.704933520025811	
80 minutes, and it felt twice that long! Brief Crossing is not brief enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue (more of a monologue, really) of a woman approaching middle age, tediously droning about "men," disappointment, sex, aging, and her recent breakup, to a French teenager she met in the ship's cafeteria.<br /><br />The tedious monologue continues as they go to duty-free shop, and to a bar, where finally her self-involved rant pushes him away. The "story" can't end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin.<br /><br />What little romance, sex, or for that matter, anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all. Yes, the ending is very nicely done, but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner.<br /><br />Of course, some people like it. I could be wrong.	-4.858127701410785	-2.1628622636292927	-2.0784441145643626	-1.9554887698951942	-1.9347997040330758	-1.1121114383659885	-0.5900200734319468	-0.5836765316947221	-0.45036450299748915	-0.38085147695253846	-0.217818157703808	-0.21750940621872195	-0.11360763196783712	-0.10798822351492567	0.22506533785292374	0.2691158245133881	0.35115480305564545	0.4128255485050153	0.4249335382650624	0.5084557043122753	0.7593513632893818	0.8857610952635856	1.6827587483014614	2.4053293262045066	5.0217786927765715	
This movie is an evolutionary piece - from Terminator to Robocop .<br /><br />Stan Winston did the SPFX !<br /><br />In this film, a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss(they always are) gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body .<br /><br />The rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this Cyborg/Man regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife, played by the gorgeous(back then in 1986) Terri Austin . (He tries to reconnect with his old life, like in that scene in RoboCop)<br /><br />The rest of this movie is about breaking things, while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill-defined 'turn humans into cyborgs' project .<br /><br />This film pays homage to previous movies like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL - - as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot Gort does .<br /><br />Except for the 'Frankenstein Suite' designed by Stan Winston, this movie's production values are typically Canadian: SLEAZY ! ! <br /><br />Pam Grier stars in this film as an hired killer-commando, a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the 80's .<br /><br />As for a Sci-Fi Horror B movie, out of 4 Stars, this film ranks about a <3	-3.3917198482323454	-1.9100309238452546	-1.6344654733998527	-1.6122681451140026	-1.5833998595591887	-0.8398572307679006	-0.7731673976780344	-0.42629734252464685	-0.288685039027054	-0.24739824858760612	-0.22326167121165252	-0.2089465603928884	-0.13765014858047353	-0.12779422609107838	0.036336497093227185	0.1335274220159851	0.23909531705204087	0.2531610471804835	0.4867573106942311	0.5237180547623631	0.6074048632328928	0.7168880549568513	0.7750489835384883	1.937936752235907	3.2667718211680197	
I felt compelled to comment on this film because it's listed as the fourth lowest-rated sci-film of all time on the IMDb. WHAT!?!? Sure, this movie is crappy, but it's HILARIOUS! It's not awful on an Ed Wood level, it's more surreal and uneven.<br /><br />There are some classic moments in the film. The brain surgery is gross and great- and even nuttier when you consider that the film was rated PG! Gor chasing after his dolly before getting battery acid dumped on his face- "Mine! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoff's speeches at the beginning of the film- "Before Amir, Kali was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has some great lines- "No, Gor! No!" "You want these keys, don't you, my pretties?" It is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th lowest-rated sci-film on the IMDb because it is ENTERTAINING. No matter how bad a film is, if it still manages to be weird, quirky, unsettling, or entertaining, it has merit and doesn't deserve to be dumped on and dismissed. I won't defend most of Al Adamson's films, but this one, along with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR, are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness.	-5.26460647241038	-2.692770933330232	-2.1480607811985637	-1.9738308153592177	-1.7294204040321617	-1.3625289542589107	-1.309245099661201	-0.590906085537267	-0.45501848640951326	-0.38657568629352534	-0.3454124397952607	0.08114697044200028	0.12502001062681153	0.19222868837212942	0.23027894631809515	0.35696486685020545	0.4482595637649314	0.616636783524831	0.7017921013430416	0.8094953904162329	0.9303772670668995	1.0388085079423084	1.289856346296792	2.893477058541767	5.968303589827308	
The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies that I really enjoyed. The subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that Hollywood was (and still is) cranking out these days. But for awhile, the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasn't toned downed or soften for the kiddies. The men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from Cannon.<br /><br />Three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school. They'll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal. The sensitive one of the group (Andrew Monsoon) what's to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get. One day, the kid finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of their foul tricks. His best friend moves on in and sweeps her off of her feet. After knocking her up, the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl preggers. Still, he tries his best to get her to love him. The night comes when he pops the question to her. But his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend. In tears, the kid leaves the party.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches. Instead of being filled with phony situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. The movie's filled with it's share of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comedies.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	-5.508363317746273	-3.7204078163005025	-2.6024656691271137	-2.1177036466770245	-0.9907196983111556	-0.7548178441021168	-0.3293732542303858	-0.3266103982687045	-0.22114845026419086	-0.08695563227284753	0.07066317378383505	0.22120899126489685	0.5525822713861035	0.6609424118957239	0.8101642228254553	0.9882992809904211	1.1319993174050416	1.1616459307209632	1.4260494033897417	1.541109692114067	1.8880592633843427	2.0293551051498144	3.0854279894309586	5.432868470317111	6.237868924223049	
I haven't been a fan of Madonna for quite sometime now, however, I thought I would comment on this film.<br /><br />This film mistaken. One of them, as well as Madonna, was panned by the critics. They were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews.<br /><br />First, Madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the film, she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life. Most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn't give her a fair shake. When you view this film I hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting. She was absolutely hysterical as was the film.<br /><br />Griffen Dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film. If you take a look at his filmography, you will see he is quite an accomplished actor.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself, this is something similar to pretty woman, but came 3 years before the Roberts, Gere success. It's a goof-ball comedy with lots of site gags, slapstick and one liners. Some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor.<br /><br />I know this doesn't tell you much about the movie, however, I hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie. It is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun.<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />Gary	-2.8295089799611794	-2.6554049614642476	-2.5642983034149744	-2.4821249844018767	-2.0130612928247236	-1.096126964756284	-1.093968443969403	-1.074120469452959	-0.4891945510171377	-0.2796411255258853	-0.267750011854935	0.05224256309013599	0.1871036343785026	0.20713560765665573	0.6330703230853449	0.8074466432028877	0.9068967166242109	0.932475790057727	1.1619450387255352	1.388619595831064	1.5294254689180504	1.7194821492651768	3.673137558788078	3.8816417240340466	5.707725678123952	
Let me tell you something...this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it ACTUALLY TRIES TO COME ACROSS AS A SERIOUS MOVIE. From the terrible acting... "I knew it, I knew she was possessed!"...to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers...this piece of dung takes the cake. I am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad. This may just be in a class all its own. The kicker is that supposedly some Cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation. I did not know that people from Backwoods USA act like utter imbeciles. I am not sure if I am upset for renting it or have stumbled across a jewel of comedy. This was a very guilty pleasure...so awful that I watched with hands over my eyes half the time (while I wasn't laughing so hard I was crying). The ending simply made no sense whatsoever, pulling the whole thing together perfectly. If you want to watch something so awful its funny, here is your movie. If you want a scary movie on exorcism....move on.	-3.960790035358697	-2.4133714168340554	-2.2962424601243634	-2.2747454834309173	-1.557753373696877	-1.4130143427438318	-1.352484171593832	-0.3747282039862237	-0.15204447160576684	-0.08066772323723453	-0.00600602482718246	0.013935471838404694	0.021323721880123863	0.05754074033317649	0.17838224519331394	0.1971063610966298	0.41621762965000564	0.48710413751158904	0.6426974348533592	1.0346351394157483	1.2424572393987887	1.2687647004449707	1.7645334268698705	2.886412249957659	5.721065336175424	
Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie... I had had a trauma after watching Welcome (2007) and thought that they wont do it again. But after loads of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended as heart attack.<br /><br />Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein..... and what u get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after her major weight loss...!!!<br /><br />Music-wise another major disaster... in the music album, they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts...! that song is such nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album!!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, i would say, watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like ...'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey...'<br /><br />Overall very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad English!<br /><br />Go away man, i need to puke!	-4.1984919046649045	-2.525695289474053	-2.3662756352131478	-2.2677728120989933	-2.2138042049645303	-1.0708548668869924	-0.8132949388189405	-0.7470762357837486	-0.4318663739445142	-0.4145454734483971	-0.17637922976565917	-0.16964649784504351	-0.1152670497977519	-0.07170282094414494	-0.005258524466057152	0.06218289707600913	0.20667785455215523	0.47544104908523477	0.6168040384918234	0.7124243296746378	0.9441141909771175	1.1762963120463032	1.3053427471504542	2.6718829521548093	4.454737756737122	
I saw this film in the movie theater. I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It is a Woodward film about one of Second City's Native sons.<br /><br />Everyone knew about Johns history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.<br /><br />But hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.<br /><br />This movie. Well. Forget the idea of poor Michael Chilklis (who is a really great actor) being in a really astonishingly bad film, and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man.<br /><br />Forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of Belushi's work...and all the SNL scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow Bob Woodwards work. Kinda saying "Okay...we are about to mess with Belushi...now lets go after Woodward too..." They also decided to take the premise of It's a Wonderful Life and turn it into It's a Horrible Life on Crack.<br /><br />Is he a guardian angel or the devil? Is the pinball machine the devil's assistant electronic device...how many different endings can you tack onto to a movie? It is one of those movies after it is over...you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go "What the hell was that?!" In some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic. But for good reason.<br /><br />A good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of (or throw out snappy one liners) to the screen. A cult film is never good. And most people would never watch them in any serious context.<br /><br />If you want to watch some classic bad late 80's fair stoned? Rent Wired. If you want to know about John Belushi...you can get more information off of the walls of Second City Chicago than this movie.	-4.915374703067358	-4.716835084394913	-3.2275727334530053	-2.3417863937748917	-1.2999813008665926	-1.2361162331434834	-1.12014301943424	-0.7423927559485874	-0.7342052971505959	-0.5358761350844345	-0.49359314732957127	-0.30417123193051404	-0.1022697418096433	0.11509790796542889	0.20337108529253786	0.22752871786449408	0.5241416182310371	0.9363543966411288	1.645426019222957	1.77530662923373	2.247051379008323	3.082032819560617	3.082409826725304	4.720924901885903	8.001325502802626	
It's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at least destroy any speeches. There's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is appalling. For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this.	-2.5270205938326935	-1.5378845242054797	-1.2088142560309838	-1.1774545649121586	-0.913160070337942	-0.8070509748717324	-0.705165238079994	-0.11443852060344657	-0.030899453234436436	-0.002847381343802219	0.005933572120015336	0.061516893146992616	0.11136792060810158	0.11719649541312571	0.13090939915169633	0.15916132356701385	0.19320898272024767	0.30895382343507866	0.3096984299489632	0.3400796907736061	0.6378480403952632	0.6497848442062343	1.372048658372365	1.4319715051529207	2.9764042072517256	
Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria. As Seventh Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God at their church, with their two older boys looking on. Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia. Not being wealthy, the family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying. As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found. Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept God's decision and go on with their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby. She is subsequently arrested and put on trial. How could this happen? This is a great depiction of real events that shows how "mob rule" is not a figment of the imagination. The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd. Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strong-willed demeanor works against her every step of the way. Neill, likewise, does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael. The cast is one of the largest ever, with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into Lindy's case. The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line. If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away. It is not a far cry from reality to say that this "Cry" should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media.	-4.325799292627878	-3.8850609792873168	-3.125433765632472	-2.3141089614219315	-1.6768787781753913	-0.9626752919859625	-0.9097840752110371	-0.5346234513928698	-0.40621394451190185	-0.3738515042554352	-0.058747731780056635	0.02974353242801983	0.05258932646024324	0.26800691448572855	0.3406610320856909	0.4271866389130443	0.6603706705046061	0.735728979927293	0.7409426911113198	0.9731613202005355	1.3426245236923537	1.6978464391133654	3.533133338106181	3.7107194911902264	7.111444508896958	
This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying. It has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of those fireside "this happened to a friend of a friend of mine" ghost stories. One big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno? So there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations, no "showdown" scenes. Thank Heaven. You have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. Williams isn't terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic ("No One") as he is the Everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (even if she maybe shouldn't win it). Give it a shot. For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.	-2.220498846813335	-2.058154979843596	-1.8805789528553885	-1.573209409042819	-0.771390628110298	-0.6478722483179178	-0.537852521889667	-0.4633272517047341	-0.32819130781920497	-0.3088622921796868	-0.23481675733984256	-0.20129463417498136	-0.17075122114893093	-0.1627469496258221	-0.026716105734158335	0.012553543821820081	0.049071075124195285	0.16191167666783884	0.6525847224648829	0.7099768500436953	1.1352718432149025	1.5907480124943398	1.8214315628167075	1.9272948481234817	3.059329697236449	
Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso. <br /><br />But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.<br /><br />And why should it. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth. <br /><br />To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film. <br /><br />His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought. He's shown in a recording studio once late in his life. Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.<br /><br />When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live. But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men. It's why both became the legends that they are.<br /><br />What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.<br /><br />Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn't get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also.<br /><br />Though Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.<br /><br />If you're looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this ain't it. If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss The Great Caruso.	-5.783489524554594	-3.6294171440387215	-2.6483942554734003	-2.152868004554345	-1.7494597918942318	-1.7166688512083896	-1.6576870411500433	-1.1225686199793492	-0.5314616964995645	-0.3969039938216997	0.13209300365541218	0.13431122201970952	0.17612770085599985	0.2417068184584945	0.2681785352477141	0.6547807652809359	1.061679519553853	1.1076901785219573	1.1319824793566617	1.3677286582653037	1.4001433391368154	2.038311480332434	2.8347988246455116	3.320213383545161	7.81034889045018	
So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her "before" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the "before" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.<br /><br />The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As has the "good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence" character been seen before. In fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes.<br /><br />One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer.	-5.612511512180486	-2.3803758386436455	-2.188046856137444	-2.17946204281721	-1.7330918292298865	-1.6921389844285972	-1.5928054974285897	-1.0046370105416036	-0.6803811322674214	-0.5264912600896168	-0.2682297462651341	-0.2218152621077239	-0.13053603236324035	0.12906807070956974	0.13314499650335956	0.37180981046342093	0.5523261660947595	0.5529161614688108	0.5928755753369587	0.6849015746784707	0.6891235940968004	1.296502645182393	2.5280505858473834	2.707798938191201	5.972507830491348	
Reba is a very dumb show. You can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should at least have SOMEONE who resembles a real-life person. I guess Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! That's my opinion on Reba. Since I have said all I can say about this show, I'll just take up the next few lines of text by saying what I am currently saying right now and do it until there's 10 lines. There. Reba gets 2/10.	-4.384104860926137	-2.2038820245605804	-2.153684407929799	-2.146104569951852	-1.459205973960623	-1.3528305215634877	-1.1333829531869606	-0.9879320167126941	-0.26411309013275436	-0.2272366635359474	-0.17507872198314675	-0.1424830904824932	-0.11738257221355158	0.01299424436196886	0.1351815636383941	0.1594074413052557	0.255217182611073	0.5456636420177674	0.5784993677201078	0.8572704905156601	0.9428877689646173	1.0226229183296254	1.146871885561719	2.060133258335128	4.4486336846452295	
Don't quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic. If it had been realistic, there certainly wouldn't have been much comedy. I also don't think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times. There was much subtle humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank just portrayed a dreamy character. In real life, there are many people whose facial expression doesn't change much so Kim Frank keeping his was quite all right. The ending was quite unrealistic, I'd say, but happy. It's a light-hearted movie with a feel-good ending. I liked it. Loved it, actually. A serious part was Krueger going to Schwedt, and I'm glad they didn't show what happened to him there. Showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly.	-2.885773807010232	-2.2401069095065087	-1.9420551830647372	-1.6890541878317467	-1.1194978879511783	-0.7325953400210214	-0.6043990718393315	-0.34389267946944047	-0.33441408572583403	-0.11571067078862575	0.03186966441624832	0.1965524720959423	0.25457594249992854	0.30186889181115295	0.33019959131288706	0.7073471427087817	0.8171146218283345	0.8654915566689856	1.0091141260439704	1.077297658847377	1.3961092346609278	1.763189375723661	2.8688740132667783	3.170766470292047	4.2451358552701	
Much worse than the original. It was actually *painful* to sit through, and it barely held my six year old's interest.<br /><br />Introduction of some new Pokemon is marginally interesting, but storyline is extra-thin, dialogue is still bad, and music is mediocre.

"Masks" is a moving film that works on many levels. At its simplest, it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although, at times the story makes the old man into a Job, it is so well crafted (written, acted, directed, wonderful production values), it is easy to move beyond his plight. And, if you hang with it, the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. Kudos all around. This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults. The trick is how to get Americans who may not like foreign language films to see it!	-2.730005542206495	-2.5362625644319676	-0.8164847243574469	-0.7807928333014083	-0.6077508453424694	-0.22999197216404077	-0.01643310743311159	0.1687815390976119	0.1797036326540893	0.32151878017901736	0.4992573566929452	0.5190216896232446	0.5345101666679654	0.5952989394575757	0.6442561369392362	0.6599385946169029	0.7571582858758377	0.8296197834890321	0.8829094694301636	1.2587964628050043	1.3617804634424848	1.7654617812677422	1.8751221361904022	1.928971366042809	3.230018017946775	
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is not a shred of historical accuracy, in fact reality is reversed. Just one example: Morgan preyed on the few ethnic Chinese he encountered. The acting is over the top, the script is a poorly written lie. I have never seen worse fake beards.<br /><br />Hopper arrived in Australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero. Since the script was ten made up on the fly, the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is.<br /><br />Any movie about Ned Kelly is a lot better than this film.	-4.648947968631072	-2.825145300787496	-2.3247416674777894	-1.9244439147689212	-1.8864965635454054	-1.8668166223222444	-1.4523752443732496	-0.5048081365222422	-0.2957303019815962	0.013333437853049884	0.023538990376825136	0.02550928501585443	0.05782497096783166	0.07116196313360505	0.13121860006691385	0.1946925933491153	0.3264146714463928	0.49862606590680403	0.6651612040637045	0.8866722591816459	0.916012664746534	0.9190211847884737	1.7982364666895947	2.734854797081592	5.173550760373472	
Say what you will about schmaltz. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about some Americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose.<br /><br />To me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny says, "We've been shaken out of the magnolias."<br /><br />In today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the 9/11 murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world.<br /><br />Today, we watch this film with a new awareness: That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things.<br /><br />Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote.<br /><br />A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals.<br /><br />Geoff	-4.638360524953255	-3.0065831827990004	-2.5949339747221276	-2.11552489566077	-1.9816322708691694	-1.6508392727636167	-1.0939365978216202	-0.4176493502458609	-0.27750375343482003	-0.0845100903347201	-0.0800788227190103	0.12733009999182127	0.24545548996708078	0.26647932897334947	0.34655722458003735	0.44563317551714016	0.7133874979549732	0.907107545369344	0.9444478311165303	1.0173422871020483	1.0554757439543252	1.1771896966838584	1.9015700886809082	3.2726814048418547	6.441654083720054	
I liked this movie. Many people refer to it as "Sabrina the Teenage Feminist". They do that with a lot of movies that Melissa Joan Hart is in. Still, she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the part of Mary, who fights for justice when her roommate is raped. You could tell that Hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Mary's roommate. She was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped. Josh Hopkins was good as the cocky and egotistical rapist. Lochlyn Munro convincingly played his character. The acting in this movie is better than in most TV movies, in my opinion.<br /><br />The movie was pretty predictable though. Also, I expected more from the ending, it was too abrupt. The delivery could have been better. But the performances and overall plot make up for these problems.	-2.62383596866155	-2.23746579751376	-1.9723801511076529	-1.7849511655276211	-1.3823837243523471	-0.8964896394085828	-0.6413522351859056	-0.5582546678548967	-0.37677798009663455	-0.30734911614413957	-0.2583784822520655	0.04900171706758302	0.08680454317343356	0.1460528158071824	0.29029574122987994	0.7091086439317988	0.770585215557109	0.82002215688799	0.9057476988277667	0.9492716136211563	1.166451180116022	1.272878611654932	2.653267760918998	3.286119103606881	3.911013324297015	
A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration on the first season's "Homecoming" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways. This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered. The supposed "payoff" showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing. If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleaning" of the planet of it's human infestation, why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion? Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of having the male population butcher the females? I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous. The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it. I like a lot of both Dante and Hamm's work but this was just unwatchable.	-4.534862895954726	-2.3997629665120734	-2.3084311460220293	-2.1968604551791877	-2.1733083552312	-1.275459542600812	-1.115089483702326	-0.7112663806250397	-0.4417527935506912	-0.3433712453418589	-0.3219922932921447	-0.26044507740966916	0.2308020178413377	0.29641243313470017	0.29687397071609256	0.2983591429862979	0.4764798783919041	0.6519975384266902	0.6711427453460971	0.9155407840075068	0.9751384963376972	1.1831224587656781	1.2837578478774403	3.2104940995875912	5.73887301038748	
First off, this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to. the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema, apparently its the other way around. If one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But really thats all it was aiming for, it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value (and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original VHS versions). <br /><br />I gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific (in non-shock sense) it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid/pessimistic(i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured)	-3.153241733491837	-1.1499991791168613	-1.1218241672627443	-1.1103713136604654	-1.0727360391732215	-0.9783273890830714	-0.8940330879429539	-0.40338552651458653	-0.2494626753669453	-0.15384783467189328	-0.06550346535265597	0.022339925236428526	0.04155119025568541	0.06279960834647533	0.06423244265485334	0.08567466002581534	0.09970449496228631	0.29589663110195696	0.3083853412945814	0.36101678661616887	0.5041935250211446	0.6014075784406036	1.517957491357218	1.5314154129815243	3.349112554021917	
I went into "Night of the Hunted" not knowing what to expect at all. I was really impressed.<br /><br />It is essentially a mystery/thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be driving past. The two become fast friends and lovers and together, they try to figure out what is going on with her. Through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool.<br /><br />I really liked the setting of this one: a desolate, post-modern Paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity.<br /><br />Surprising it was made in 1980; seems somewhat ahead of it's time.<br /><br />8 out of 10, kids.	-1.9303235286318259	-1.679275057439037	-1.2219493165588649	-0.8746804520420056	-0.6834128889071556	-0.5807235976428293	-0.5067806582286548	-0.45385039847947084	-0.33462775393983835	-0.24991871242394337	-0.21227375095815793	-0.2087248139020192	-0.1829173983092329	-0.022458437917560956	0.15438256098681818	0.27677901227382284	0.3126440512605456	0.5362183170083141	0.5936615757655391	0.8877394997756995	0.9549462968859127	0.9938712402878591	1.1042907495177396	1.535052550870787	2.5723323142875945	
"CIA Codename:Alexa" is an absolute horrible rip off of Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita"(1990). The film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission for them. (Pretty much the same story structure of La Femme Nikita) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history. Lamas' "acting" is simply a bad Steven Segal impersonation. Watching Orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience.<br /><br />The writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable. There are so many action movie "conventions" in the film it is ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying thru glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. The musical score resembles David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which furthers the Steven Segal theme of this movie. There is plenty of martial arts in the film, and it is pretty well done for a low budget American production. The mindless action and over the top acting never lets up, and I have to admit I was mildly entertained. <br /><br />Lorenzo Lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90's but he is certainly no action star, that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters. My recommendation is that you skip "CIA Codename:Alexa" and check out "La Femme Nikita" instead.	-6.355553162198181	-4.373503948020942	-4.0291460999161375	-3.3003449625381687	-3.042462249945284	-1.9868686164287643	-1.4733422128537934	-1.2603697908504499	-0.4106938854704467	-0.4066812419538872	-0.2827454450595618	-0.20992473444861018	-0.09991485705320222	-0.051854636395686285	0.3768511557043026	0.4429239307655145	0.531539365174599	0.7993895112195003	0.9788132527017621	1.0031766369053592	1.3366298069944056	1.94868370564863	2.00322683637666	4.299646756432096	7.4181436043266515	
Although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society, I don't object to the extremely high salaries for many of today's entertainers and athletes.<br /><br />A-Rod, LeBron or Brady all have deals either well with 8 figures, or the low-9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows, huge residuals and fees they currently demand. Even their cast members, and all of the "Friends" group reached near or over 7 figures per episode. Letterman's earnings for one show could solve most people's financial problems, and a week or two's take care of many for life.<br /><br />But all of these are based upon sound supply/demand principals, and the financial benefits they bring to their employers. And all perform their crafts ably.<br /><br />But then comes along someone like Rachel Ray, who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. I find her shrill, annoying, and with a forced "perkiness" that's as phony as the proverbial "3-dollar bill."<br /><br />A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates. One of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $5-10K level, to a handful who get $200K and up per appearance. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams, and, no kidding, Larry the Cable Guy.)<br /><br />There are a greater number in the $100,001 - 200,000 range; list included the likes of Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even cable guy Larry's benefactor, Jeff Foxworthy. <br /><br />This category includes Rachael Ray. I suppose I have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her "talent" and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who'll pay more than $100K, + first class air, hotel suite, all expenses and limos door-to-door, for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization's event. <br /><br />I just can't figure how-in-the-hell this could be possible.	-5.681852952216621	-3.4057894815174996	-2.636949427153917	-2.48935691774529	-2.2416264697153987	-1.6675188356814108	-1.3347935786844556	-1.065957681166938	-0.7257569702990027	-0.5619154810753301	-0.37344982850174036	-0.2800851150771848	0.14003665924560196	0.22137717591899472	0.4941885773967252	0.5909922318017318	0.8715433541974813	0.9201955241381311	1.2147999330197377	1.3007885998502648	1.4724437068694514	1.5166599075603497	1.716947744994448	3.376967757356915	6.403581603970511	
This movie is horrible. THe acting is a waste basket. No crying, no action, hopeless songs. Though the scenery is great. I have always wanted to go to Greece.<br /><br />Anyway, as for Saif, you'd expect a great performance, but even he let down the people.<br /><br />Akshay Kumar, recognized as the pimp of Bollywood and the voice of Singhs. He was sensational in this movie. For only this performance, Filmfare should introduce another award. The toiletries award for the worst performance. By the way the trophy should be a toilet seat.<br /><br />Kareena Kapoor. She first of all is not comparable to her sister Karisma. In acting, in looks, or in body. She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her. She comes into this movie wearing bikini's and tank tops and short shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is letting his wife-to-be dress like that. But, she must've impressed some people dressing like that. And if you ask how, then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie. They are dreaming of having Kareena Kapoor in bed naked with a condom. Including me. Personally I think that she dressed like a whore, but I really liked it.<br /><br />I am forced to give it a 1/10, but I'd really give this movie a 0/10. An unachieved film.	-7.742976992821517	-4.663839030160488	-4.405614823812033	-3.976970308396766	-2.6971437132169633	-2.4945538253607045	-2.0456980157252946	-0.688681830848931	-0.508135504823758	-0.27840148671920756	-0.2331168889711928	-0.14136764229903453	-0.05965699551211727	-0.03864644083931468	0.15592168801164355	0.3663009636365256	0.4299290215185835	1.360814651952075	1.4696181014230236	1.7930055551346253	1.8023772394729782	2.7348534948824628	3.0535533372175627	5.353170325593455	9.824463270594368	
They changed the title of this atrocity to An Unexpected Love. The only thing worse is the film itself. The script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital. At one point when the wife leaves the husband, a bad cover of All by Myself plays over the soundtrack! No kidding. The actors try but are defeated by the inept, unbelievably terrible script. Direction is staggeringly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How do things like this get made. I'm turning off the television before it's over!	-5.773061869441091	-2.153270918097587	-1.956389826477749	-1.8792343031433234	-1.8583174721921107	-1.8001807466932118	-1.409005796645397	-0.639445685762798	-0.5974376458265076	-0.3221178846964216	-0.2999261626986343	-0.26449604437295965	-0.11073715242926499	-0.06831005744427449	0.2572908879830711	0.3144342012800644	0.4417003460055083	0.45074413253378764	0.754377741052784	0.8120026984563788	0.8317521265944711	0.8805563497123876	2.4115869901453753	2.8037188721853696	5.732698921749137	
Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. where cast perfectly in this film. It's a heart-warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters. The screenwriter didn't incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do, which I thought created a more realistic story line.<br /><br />Writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard. <br /><br />There are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris should have been nominated for an Academy Award because he was great as a leader and coach, realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping Radio.	-1.6749316456299779	-1.219885865524928	-1.1812554450845532	-0.8946648044853116	-0.5532821639120259	-0.4643954637869805	-0.3336687801434019	-0.29477316111570623	-0.26783173998516346	-0.18194874267235173	-0.15863011287191744	-0.04197477051584135	0.008784511896790165	0.01788170302509224	0.09995461630568556	0.27657441850315856	0.2993976901008247	0.30596541303489144	0.3427115674624852	0.5806322695463163	0.6912745616253897	0.8056282873942372	1.5733773272465577	1.677452737949154	2.2727157057482135	
Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. She wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. She and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical Asian paradise. They have decided to keep an "open" sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. The scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. The imagery is very similar to that of the movie "Black Emanuelle". It is rich and colorful.

I cannot believe that this movie was ever created. I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse. The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup. The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies total, definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie, if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished. Again to reiterate other user comments, the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie. Also, there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all. It is never explained.	-4.293873902706089	-1.5267345454410093	-1.3628655011395414	-1.3462943266343106	-1.32594203683748	-1.2875500208562438	-1.0806055040060043	-0.7670672459002992	-0.5017678316905673	-0.18587720657957285	-0.105056902734022	0.02899392145947304	0.06755878732660058	0.22680989384119576	0.2401463270167372	0.2533147018633011	0.2968713373860462	0.34763818071265395	0.3846002322208515	0.4829831369634242	0.49519160121217815	0.8163877685443106	1.597582733701274	2.128128664995056	4.763074912865891	
American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded.<br /><br />At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store. They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. After in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.<br /><br />Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wished. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.<br /><br />Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.<br /><br />One of the best romance movies. 9/10	-2.2849938099892224	-2.046782060335051	-1.2509435347798084	-0.9974228926004723	-0.9756848331306928	-0.5364209790857077	-0.44301603604819234	-0.05244109590555075	0.01608120551442461	0.1566540058469968	0.2583957559249783	0.3117772481676204	0.3925504730738745	0.4567332015081469	0.515981482789005	0.6118439086143799	0.6204679938778935	0.7470899124547529	0.766369223690884	0.7986316257874476	1.0043997172902543	1.5025154042153381	2.085332185552545	3.419378163770789	4.065957013064073	
Warner Brothers tampered considerably with American history in "Big Trail" director Raoul Walsh's first-rate western "They Died with Their Boots On," a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film chronicles Custer from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn. This is one of Errol Flynn's signature roles and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn teamed in quite often afterward, and "They Died with Their Boots On" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute, black & white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes, and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries. One of the notorious errors involves Colonel Philip Sheridan who is shown as the commandant at West Point before the Civil War. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. In fact, the commandant was Robert E. Lee as the earlier Flynn film "Santa Fe Trail" showed. Another historical lapse concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of Union troops throughout the Civil War. Warner Brothers presented Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer neither drank nor smoked. Nevertheless, these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film.<br /><br />"They Died with Their Boots On" opens with Custer riding into West Point Military Academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an African-American carrying his luggage and tending his dogs. After the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant turns Custer over to a ranking cadet Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy of "City for Conquest") to take charge of him. Sharp plays a practical job on Custer by installing him in the quarters of Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of "Task Force") who promptly runs Custer out. Naturally, the volatile Custer attacks Sharp in a public brawl. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of "The Sons of Katie Elder") is prepared to dismiss Custer from West Point for conduct unbecoming. As it turns out, Sheridan cannot expel Custer because Custer has not enrolled. Once he enrolls, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore. When the American Civil War erupts, West Point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat. One of the last cadets hustled off to war is Custer. Avid as he is to get into the fight, Custer encounters his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland of "Santa Fe Trail"), and they pledge themselves to each other, despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart of "Carousel") who detests the sight of Custer. It seems that Bacon ran across Custer at a saloon and insulted one of Custer's friends and our hero reprimanded Bacon.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in Washington, Custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but Major Taipe has him cooling his heels. Custer befriends rotund Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon") and they share an appetite for creamed Bermuda onions that becomes one of Custer's characteristics. Not only does Scott see to it that Taipe assigns Custer to the Second Cavalry, but also Custer appropriates Taipe's horse to get to his command. During the Battle of Bull Run, 21 July 1861, Custer disobeys orders from none other than Sharp, strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it. Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Custer receives a medal rather than a court-martial. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the chance that the South may triumph. When a brigadier general cannot be found, Scott goads Taipe into promoting the first available officer. A mistake is made and Custer is promoted. Incredulous at first, Custer embraces the moment and cracks Stuart's advance. After the war, Custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons. Sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist Custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds. Eventually, Libby intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan, who was in command of the army, and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that Sharp commands the liquor at the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first run in with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn of "The Guns of Navarone") and takes him into custody. Of course, Crazy Horse escapes, becomes Custer's adversary, and they fight.<br /><br />Once Custer has quelled Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp with Taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other Indian nations. They also see to it that Custer is brought up on charges for striking Taipe in a saloon brawl. On his way to Washington, Custer discovers the perfidy of Sharp and Taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred Black Hills. Settlers rampage in and the Indians hit the warpath. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the Little Big Horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins. "Stagecoach" lenser Bert Glennon captures both the grit and the glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular. As an added premonition of Custer's imminent demise, Libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the Little Big Horn. "They Died with Their Boots On" benefits from a top-notch Max Steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune "Gary Owen."	-18.029088697088692	-9.915820655739362	-7.625050738568791	-7.320517234207469	-5.503182157852542	-5.2737504522019005	-4.79188771016664	-1.6329006490682956	-1.6219384261024825	-1.5132373545356301	-0.8436655661620515	-0.3249160249369694	-0.1369714799446961	0.5914100057957363	1.4470386222377805	1.5368532755723638	1.999643468633361	2.284052655177292	2.99194204650311	4.090559536932551	4.646766400629355	4.707501729391056	4.794606851212581	11.1703146905388	22.817981628981695	
This is a true story of an Australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn't particularly likable.<br /><br />The media frenzy that surrounded this case in Australia is reminiscent of the Sam Sheppard murder case in Ohio during the 50's. These real-life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled. I well remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer running a huge headline stating "Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?". The prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years in jail was he exonerated.<br /><br />I love movies which tell a true story, do it in an interesting way, and make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line", and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another Australian film which is highly recommended.<br /><br />8/10	-2.742022029951447	-1.3748242523490055	-1.3042342694344653	-1.2657206922981157	-0.9378952740822042	-0.5570933220915344	-0.396847078970639	-0.27547662763762254	-0.23497649272587984	0.012296171308937016	0.11959805537650511	0.12781806923520456	0.20333532215434683	0.2416562561553218	0.323949915392918	0.4449056168541499	0.5503176235501144	0.5641021697353608	0.5810407890553457	0.7788758754948488	0.794812759210019	0.9459325411192978	1.8195662073003032	2.2336724688823493	3.5530157268797784	
Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****	-1.745734964411771	-0.9678600906276517	-0.6799392726588184	-0.6491061791574365	-0.645636584043166	-0.6291605590268697	-0.468583656224729	-0.3867160211221475	-0.19068236643459918	-0.15072144078537897	0.057322793286748816	0.08368164413675691	0.11532609585051176	0.14084031300629418	0.26872322291916084	0.2909183901358775	0.36895216427866107	0.39863824026883704	0.3989676016849057	0.40418949682114075	0.5173751965896088	0.6413973894864984	1.0910868828402231	1.3165123982567752	2.218590284841461	
This is a story of a long and awkward love. The daily life of a woman of 50 years old and some people around her is depicted. Her daily life is so ordinary and routine that I doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning. Then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high-school class mate had very tiny connection. The woman has been doing the same job - a milk-woman and a supermarket casher - so long. There are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job. The man had married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. He works at the City Hall and devotedly cares her at home. They never look straight nor talk each other, but they never forget each other. <br /><br />The original Japanese title means "At some time the days you read books". But of course when the man said "Now I want to do what I've always wanted to do", it was to hug her and make love with her. She writes to a radio disk jockey that "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least a whole day". Dreaming of that day, she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and book reading. I personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years, even after he married another woman and died for an accident. Therefore the story setting is not that special. Rather, this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women. Through this movie, you will recall your romance that is lost long ago. This is a movie with lasting effect.	-4.045595453617976	-2.7032274818141127	-2.678704976782531	-1.9472882440264614	-1.1130411755032665	-0.891277630299256	-0.7738260369316774	-0.5192040064319572	-0.4203869585334323	-0.22235752195692915	-0.13096243823345827	-0.10605877890526022	0.050120994984284184	0.1304946416734427	0.16780499266820448	0.49783568418484103	0.5092468922973574	0.7175100243187045	1.0336966417532183	1.1437533038191476	1.2143597411658393	1.524322028819384	2.836347000859677	3.2894944983680015	5.202786847742023	
This is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's noose, then sets about "taming" his reluctant bride. It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time. We never find out, for example, why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband. Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a "real man" in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own. This only made sense in fifties Hollywood.<br /><br />There's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip--the second time--then yanks her off her horse. Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye, which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip! Then, he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp. That's some second wind. Later, he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians (as they all are in these flicks) after they reject her now she's his "squaw". Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she's been negotiating with them for years. And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him--yeah, right. Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.<br /><br />Finally, neither of the leads is convincing in their roles. Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky. Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot, but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy. The only reason you'd root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film's end. The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls. Even if you do see them as dolls, the total lack of suspense will bore you.<br /><br />Total waste of time. Even the scenery's kinda dull. Give this one a big miss.	-10.698242188329164	-4.706501024630619	-4.535266260760739	-4.530478099062748	-4.157374400250789	-3.5790566598112714	-3.1748897359064054	-1.0933529579954648	-0.9607974814118427	-0.6508897262551401	-0.6490699520112538	-0.23211855697066794	0.008030552555282046	0.031526603893117754	0.0898069953461878	0.687893472681804	0.8168295171588804	0.9846904123410383	1.1408694326880149	1.2330253312131867	1.4258598157937856	1.7671399060567283	4.648240424583792	5.181229403776899	11.785940312207993	
this movie is outrageous. by outrageous, i mean awful. i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. the acting got progressively worse as the "movie" advanced, and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached. when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem. that was not intelligent. truthfully, stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed. if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie, bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.	-2.8890039862519306	-1.5474239206186096	-1.276075882834419	-1.0117196027749413	-1.0073028248086566	-0.9041357327632666	-0.7584690384387095	-0.488719063747662	-0.4338976235299361	-0.20903599782757873	-0.180469991941287	-0.1682976438148804	-0.07241357617723773	0.1038181801091617	0.1810730535113121	0.27454135430679383	0.32642496842368385	0.4618539371913225	0.5128972618241133	0.5252370122918819	0.6107491128657943	0.7142829371019815	0.7430183400834198	1.5751872257186097	3.064564635454184	
Although coming after three Star Wars, Krull & countless others, this movie would look outdated in the 1950s... 1 SFX mostly consist of 1970s videogames effects such as bolts etc; annoying after a short while. You also get a SFX creature that looks like a poor man's version of some tier-IV Harryhausen monster.<br /><br />2 sets are mainly ruins in the countryside, with papier-mache temples and miniature cities or abodes that makes 1950s Japanese monster movies look like flawless perfection.<br /><br />3 Plot is paper extra-thin...Hercules must find Zeus' seven golden thunderbolts stolen by conspiring gods & zombie tyrants.<br /><br />4 action mainly consists in retarded, muscled-up Hercules ( check the variety of facial expressions ) wrestling cheap 1970s videogames effects.<br /><br />5 acting award goes to Milly Carlucci (third Carlucci show-biz sister with Anna & Gabriella ), which says all.<br /><br />6 SFX make other tier-II Italian salad bowl movies such as L'UMANOIDE & STAR CRASH look like masterpieces.<br /><br />Well, considering that Ferrigno's main acting exploit consisted in impersonating a retarded green monster, wearing a whig and green espadrillas, we ought to be lenient.<br /><br />Watch it & forget about it.	-5.722872605209787	-3.1102787346022787	-3.0145085075948175	-2.834638300546717	-2.788494215579359	-1.0318217413091983	-0.9050410195881361	-0.6701402626810186	-0.6365129780758054	-0.5392478604978411	-0.49892889459268486	-0.4913067204863009	-0.349761416296228	0.16395780795499942	0.21022112146397604	0.21317335166716253	0.32018940232416726	0.4439562973026582	0.8373197003782558	0.866065722295896	1.1303691081068936	1.1517900579564346	1.96041038283981	2.950983450747579	5.61402329510382	
I grew up on Scooby Doo Where Are You, and I still love it. It is one of my favourite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show though is good for kids, the voices are good(Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation. However it is rather disappointing. I normally don't mind Scrappy, but when he appears to be like the main character, it gets annoying fast. Complete with the catchphrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual. Also half the gang are missing after the first year, somehow it didn't feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal, very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo:Get a Clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voices, theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids.

I first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality. It is one of the most touching films I have ever seen, though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial - too much beautiful, if you will. Anyway, one thing is for sure - the camera man has done a great job - each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art, comparable to the Chirico's or Bernard Buffet's paintings.<br /><br />The music forms a perfect background for the story, especially U2's one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene. As for the casting - I cannot be objective since I like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others.<br /><br />However, the very fact that many people (critics and those sophisticated in cinema) criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time. No doubt, the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous. But this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved - was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked Marceau or what?). Apparently, it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of Malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot.<br /><br />Other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot, which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them. The scene when Jean Reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible. The feeling of moist air and fine haze, which is being spread by the first "Ferrera" scene can literally be sensed through the screen. No doubt, Antonioni is a great master of shades and semi-shades. My favorite novel is the last one - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - I guess that it the most Antonioni-like one in the whole movie - almost a parable.Probably, the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small Ghotic Italian town, with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements, fountains with the l'eau potable and monumental cathedrals... It was laconic but really touching.<br /><br />I hope that my impressions and comments on the movie, however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it (it works better with the home theater, having somebody caring by your side, than in the movie theater). Enjoy.<br /><br />I beg your pardon for the imperfect English and any possible misspellings	-5.062900868428088	-4.610847134617734	-2.545115087757034	-2.502373978708565	-1.9379027688970283	-0.6054403119803599	-0.27297503807337037	-0.19041866961013598	0.5486213859599566	0.5938051982149088	0.6136061849340132	0.7716375892118998	0.8643775078427968	0.8982443559334292	0.9792138555186392	1.1506479091117652	1.1528080820903728	1.3395915297320524	1.4090928347766678	1.673826639832312	1.8200100279082674	2.068815974372231	4.349715057282185	5.64796024957664	5.823246214832968	
This film has to be the worst I have ever seen. The title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope. The story line of the film is laughable at best, with the acting so poor you just have to cringe. The title 'Zombie Nation' implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total. This cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80's music when the zombies 'attack'. The zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a La Roux video. If you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so, then burn the copy.	-3.2505420329723798	-1.713671095874293	-1.6647393163461142	-1.4343908008658193	-1.323251395570787	-1.1693458075119973	-0.9120455266412708	-0.1979914903612387	-0.18406209086671704	-0.1780205152656958	-0.16891618340881692	-0.10797135307190961	-0.10454645995501159	0.006124541048019072	0.12584368125177364	0.24058364417854783	0.3425268378569908	0.41645697376240526	0.4680773539395841	0.7553861732123018	0.8919078605102911	0.9924890055829554	1.3748499006921526	2.0064459725107584	3.651536262884201	
I'm a huge fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. The too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich Lord are spot-on and entertaining. But for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. The music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary. Clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice. Too bad.<br /><br />I can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arc, at least in terms of perception. For example, Watson's character, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to grate on me near the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offered. And I went from disliking Wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).<br /><br />This movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a "Love Story" or "Steel Magnolias" illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact, so I was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed (Was it the Lord driving the car? The Lord's dog?). The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and relates how brave Watson is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, Florence Nightingale incarnate, etc. was OK until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby. Good God! If you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and so she drives her hard working, well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. Her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.<br /><br />Look, everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. I'm not anti PC or anything, it just didn't ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. The ending for me was (and not the director's intention I am certain) depressing. The movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together, so I found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. I'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. Is that asking too much?<br /><br />My score: 4/10	-10.636608814482685	-5.174093029927556	-5.054638011350664	-4.495832804830515	-4.318689856870995	-2.924024421582328	-2.660456038625489	-0.895067472926316	-0.7504289195500635	-0.7310747452980139	-0.3326028129221989	-0.17147788990477253	-0.052977554863218645	0.3944189339235642	0.5628244274532512	0.7968884183412588	0.9033393388957801	1.217880069640223	1.2326550368163491	1.6694976425660222	1.9743807002242795	2.0377676696168865	2.6993552079934857	6.637422715384817	12.315708350026192	
The first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her.She is beaten savagely,spun around in the chair endlessly,has her finger nails pulled,animal guts are thrown at her,hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle(really sick and nasty scene).The makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape.Of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome.I have seen also "Flowers of Flesh and Blood" which is more gory and sadistic,but less disturbing.Anyway,this one is a must-see for horror fans!	-1.2447353668985617	-1.0027775938985672	-0.9854946901836179	-0.7563049645659535	-0.726316117697589	-0.4109428466471649	-0.4024541077285254	-0.2908959015294296	-0.24442870544252648	-0.19699437503102712	-0.1465693392644181	-0.12578598146529643	-0.08750956893144006	-0.0343564301835608	0.0038076715920407067	0.04752040607317866	0.11408659214894604	0.1281233159473336	0.2152704541265693	0.23514413426574807	0.32053901746822594	0.4699610103472703	0.49719170404873647	0.7380219950718987	1.3741785046409933	
i LOVED THIS MOVIEE well i loved the romance part with COlby and the girl...Rachel (?) 4got her name....i honestly was only interested in those too. i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that. but please no more sad endings where they cant be 2gether! =( it made me cry! but the romance between them. the plot the trauma everything was great. =) i just was more into Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat. because i sure was. Honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent ending. I hated the ending, a better one could have been more thought out, not the fact of forcing COlby to his death and Rachel having a son. The ending would have killed the movie.	-2.133762093942132	-2.047016065753737	-1.7324240936188682	-1.189028057293243	-1.092114733509474	-0.6878398960911608	-0.6096230371445333	-0.39291727357244577	-0.3866102752115528	-0.19020072820803036	-0.012821335161027493	0.020847887449364614	0.039438049696512434	0.1566872848476092	0.23343315637479423	0.596503354758331	0.704916741822809	0.8460388962832437	0.8585300601217364	1.0028135579227375	1.0356459896773926	1.0661918590516541	2.074133955084331	2.2439411622449335	3.284857999878396	
This movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. Admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).	-3.4462647323889044	-2.0985891504008425	-1.9376346425363447	-1.7712351341180248	-1.2475703942462422	-0.9007048714187647	-0.7780594889070706	-0.42192085713968563	-0.3180320994622842	-0.21181189352791735	-0.08078302369869184	0.011440247930482692	0.02001275760015835	0.08794170123856879	0.14817385877331207	0.4239141053510608	0.427297789243048	0.5496545890532836	0.6490594826239526	0.7777865457670431	0.8671687315492518	1.102374867258358	1.2587820155573308	2.1811403438516392	3.7446036847903	
Not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted, I will only say this: <br /><br />Nearly everybody says they loved Curly best... but I will put BRIDELESS GROOM up against ANY of other the Stooges shorts. <br /><br />I think it's the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable.<br /><br />The off-key singing student... Christine McIntire's "Cousin Basil" routine, and of course Emil Sitka's J.P. are highlights, but only around the Stooges' impeccable timing and the great writing too!<br /><br />Nuff said.	-1.3300199057855808	-1.0169542314840225	-0.8311444734665836	-0.8239564726192985	-0.5783622575055373	-0.23254357613568447	-0.1593823016878376	-0.1355135440270186	-0.10660041453026009	-0.1005224364164799	-0.0720664893728828	0.019632397862559353	0.09588326384358363	0.09690689536980596	0.18675510863417802	0.1972739185861423	0.23215741585059918	0.27293326567483034	0.34622274037473705	0.40163114284081003	0.40656430768630597	0.4779070651960323	0.4994979190271049	1.0826052153247057	2.043055284542219	
Upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of Philip Baker Hall I rented the first season disc of the Loop.It's a typical TV comedy with all the clichés that the genre employs with the "wacky" scheming brother (Sully), "ditzy" blonde (Lizzy), token unrequited love interest (Piper), sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, which reminded me of Arliss, as if ANYone needed to be reminded of THAT show). The plot deals with various bad luck (usually by Sully) that befalls Sam that puts his job at the airplane in jeopardy, only to have him save the day, with 'hilarious hijinks' ensuing in the middle. I didn't descibe a certain episode. I described them ALL to a T. Therein lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets uselessly stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless repetition. Sully will do something 'wacky', Mimi Rogers will say something overtly sexual, Russ will tell about his gay son, Darcy will do her impersonation of Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah blah. The only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's any good. Go watch a far better comedy. Arrested Development, Always Sunny in Phillidelphia, two name two off the top of my head. Surprised that this one is still on the air. OH that's right Fox only cancels the good shows, i forgot. Needless to say I don't trust my friend's taste in shows anymore.<br /><br />My Grade: D+	-4.010467451113206	-2.4642049503330767	-2.3049085182916587	-1.7960159138567344	-1.7152833330283124	-0.9511441227437326	-0.7866506535873912	-0.570378164117378	-0.5072404843616858	-0.1282195757731254	-0.04992025318689405	0.0162479942842344	0.11931919844652825	0.14943687008884227	0.1577677637611766	0.2793059053197202	0.3711294162898845	0.44942062998495313	0.7014739454694903	0.8923889497787402	1.236417797407994	1.6322618930582597	1.886358961484688	2.8280516943244587	5.437662633534892	
***Comments contain spoilers*** I was barely holding on to this show as appointment TV when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps was averaging almost a shooting per case, when the very nasally Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we weren't to notice) and when Colby was a f*****g TRIPLE agent. But now, in tonight's episode,David is trapped with a paranoid, nut job who is an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun, in an elevator and....HE CAN'T DISARM HIM. A trained, experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand fighting, CAN'T TAKE OUT A NUT JOB. Not when said nut job blinks, looks away, drops his head, closes his eyes; not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds.<br /><br />Then the scene came that let me know that as much as I enjoy learning from the chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick/love interest Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged. Don gives David the "distress word" that is the code for "The s**t is about to go down"; David is ready, they kill the lights, drop the elevator, startle the nut job and......<br /><br />David CANNOT DISARM/KILL/BEAT INTO SUBMISSION THE NUT JOB. The bad guy ends up with BOTH GUNS, David ends up SHOT.<br /><br />I'm done. Hope the NUMB3RS are fun.	-4.576768866728786	-2.2158910708069195	-2.211206752375298	-2.049714977604133	-1.8035239546266841	-1.1093251078052127	-1.0103633944248054	-0.5635508977231487	-0.13232828061250682	-0.11917416756452548	-0.11208044513143753	-0.05402352574296293	-0.043363951872962825	0.12422433814174225	0.15646841371979936	0.1630491418439864	0.27547544515743194	0.3239991269111738	0.341552652945566	0.4995073130587143	0.5856477560362403	0.7694626085267182	1.6048490123926902	2.419494091585355	4.651001403059364	
This was a superb episode, one of the best of both seasons. Down right horror for a change, with a story that is way way above the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck, in which he was driving. His airbag worked, her's didn't. She is burned beyond recognition (great makeup btw), and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology, and when she does die for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. Carnage of course ensues, and also some extremely gory killings, and also, some extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask for, you might ask? Well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical ending, that should leave a smile on most viewers faces. I just loved Rob Schmidt's (Wrong Turn) direction too, he has a great knack for horror. Excellent episode, this is one I'm buying for sure.	-2.041360229071094	-1.989846644533439	-1.9442551696280308	-1.6563387741642375	-1.1145569032671887	-0.8545307563904073	-0.5895717113355188	-0.5536564689240367	-0.2882340084792909	-0.15321137071157998	0.06831977231127002	0.08840148291432512	0.2034389559711124	0.26960917322225914	0.41463846748445765	0.44798290441668864	0.62026105243101	0.649739762362366	0.8904978386744707	0.9034138566784687	1.1004353243756606	1.1294447333795077	2.0928273309703322	2.886615033434074	4.497494322981954	
Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 Euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie. My points;<br /><br />Film is based on 2 things;<br /><br />1) Ethnical point of View: As it happens on most of the American Films, the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture. For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that. Lebanese people are Christian (Ok they got that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries. The main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make ethnocentrism. So we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film. <br /><br />2) Sexual revolution of a girl: There is nothing much to say about this. Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrong.<br /><br />I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning about the movie.	-5.128947353531027	-3.1167675944883624	-2.511487424715707	-2.396787311451117	-1.5944432448156984	-1.5826345000382582	-1.3875778467766728	-0.7084407164208286	-0.658693257727156	-0.5606779781954444	-0.2939453056877408	-0.13590283010315052	-0.032965271838470964	0.1322649073904147	0.16537589807705377	0.38928843776798705	0.5287950065510403	0.5961234545788928	1.0091879473568295	1.1620756531004581	1.2248861703586016	1.3740487143191344	1.685936619416018	3.247616088070652	6.1575302846345075	
Dorothy Stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci-fi spoof, and her appearance is a disappointment. Though she has the title role, her screentime is limited, and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue.

The original The Man Who Knew Too Much brought Alfred Hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom. Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how Hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot inside a studio.<br /><br />For whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake, Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him (Paramount)decided to see what The Man Who Knew Too Much would be like with a lavish budget. This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office. This was James Stewart's third of four Hitchcock films and his only teaming with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock film.<br /><br />I do wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that Hitchcock favored. Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. <br /><br />Doris does some of her best acting ever in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her doctor husband James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. But Doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. <br /><br />Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to Stewart about an assassination to take place in Albert Hall in London. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.<br /><br />For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a Hitchcock film. Doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, it even competed with the fast rising Elvis Presley that year. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song beating out such titles as True Love from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days. It became Doris Day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.<br /><br />In fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as Doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.<br /><br />Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real Albert Hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed, it's choreographed. You'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.<br /><br />This was remake well worth doing.	-5.693010299905263	-4.703925370014565	-2.988299189665907	-1.6835137865154368	-1.6068459068936365	-1.5386030257066958	-1.3179759571193361	-1.0639568979213556	-1.0063495008033656	-0.9567371049880541	-0.5353529759006667	-0.5290546928136645	-0.5266289446789737	-0.06074639881045027	0.29896373325816306	0.31977770497810193	1.150767141689578	1.8227118044280495	1.9122270093028537	1.9440193924765963	2.252261980087318	2.2722996152109993	3.6563765142959466	4.586319817515034	7.594536350278241	
Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series.<br /><br />There's no escaping facts. How much you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi TV series.<br /><br />Stargate SG-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly. Special FX aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair. Or couch for that matter either.<br /><br />But, and this is where I really think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for each and every episode or stolen idea I think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour TV episode.<br /><br />In fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies.<br /><br />And being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes Stargate SG-1 special.<br /><br />I am very picky with my selections. I follow perhaps one or two TV series at most and I hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when I found myself caught.<br /><br />So for those who decide to brush of Stargate SG-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show, don't. Stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about.	-5.098307395465698	-3.0300949000631907	-2.987520576982467	-2.907625244132932	-2.647457258307559	-0.8802639990200681	-0.7865901516497551	-0.6262446912185695	-0.5836446945449659	-0.47924562808462035	-0.23494726579388253	9.381172553596523E-4	0.002281505354736535	0.17842304012164398	0.28143698972296066	0.2959715433996708	0.478059308759504	0.574690755528656	0.7214952380537073	0.7751183277372616	0.895947201213448	1.096656484076043	1.4070451940381463	2.9958198499351445	5.9752986614789325	
It's true that "They Died With Their Boots On" gives a highly fictionalized account of George Armstrong Custer's (Errol Flynn) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the US-American cavalryman and Native American leader Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I'm almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man" in its unqualified anti-Custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison. Further, one should not be mislead by the title of the picture  this isn't just a movie about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, it's a movie about that shows the unreliable West Point cadet, the famed Civil War hero, the Indian fighter, and, last but not least, the husband.<br /><br />The movie begins with Custer's time at the West Point military academy, where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. During a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is a native of Monroe, Michigan. Custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the Civil War calls him away. Custer's legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary Southern cavalry general Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he travels to Monroe and courts Elizabeth, who promises him her hand in matrimony. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married.<br /><br />With the Civil War over, Custer is demoted, doesn't get a real command, and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small, professional American army. As he starts to drink, his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general-in-chief Winfield Scott. Custer is given the command of the US 7th Cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse are desirous of battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through Indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties. Custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of Crazy Horse's cause, but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle.<br /><br />"They Died With Their Boots On," though short on historical accuracy, is as good as war movies and Westerns in the 1940s got: Both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by major actors, neither the Indians nor the Southern Confederacy are denigrated, and the courtship scenes with beautiful Livvy de Havilland are just charming. The only minus, and that's why I can't give this picture a full 10, is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of African American servants; Elizabeth's servant Callie is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mammy.<br /><br />It is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either Custer or Crazy Horse, but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring Washington politicians with semi-criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the Native Americans. Just a couple of years later, the insinuation that American entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers.<br /><br />Needless to say that "They Died With Their Boots On" omits the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy, greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with Stuart, and doesn't mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Nevertheless, Custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the Battles of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the Civil War as "They Died With Their Boots On" suggests.<br /><br />In any event, "They Died With Their Boots On" is a well-made war movie with Western elements, three outstanding performers (Flynn, Quinn, and de Havilland), and offers a positive view of Native Americans as well as a negative one on big money, which wouldn't be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades to come. It would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the racist minstrelization of African Americans.	-12.206879355318831	-5.791442808865243	-5.605917033781693	-5.4157692713073535	-4.987060643868789	-2.909735776660161	-1.3150899413647505	-1.1917094593303574	-1.1162589824748261	-0.9740482890745314	-0.7678752995981265	-0.309451094230549	-0.22516140315329577	0.5557854710383833	0.7109673359120706	0.9105036602461449	0.9129285713818143	0.9239765211759762	1.1981949630059159	1.1986907454655131	2.164407827854437	2.395172856240161	4.406124888342603	6.292306832512491	13.854124704558501	
Once again Canadian TV outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode. <br /><br />Last time I remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter. How funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all Muslims are terrorists? OK maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses. But not 30 minutes. It's called beating a dead horse. Even SNL would know to give up after a commercial break.<br /><br />Also, let's have a little conflict in these scripts. Will she or won't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on Ramadan? When will Ramadan start? Ohhhhh this is Emmy winning stuff here. <br /><br />And the characters! What characters?! They are all cardboard cut-outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next. That's the point of the situation comedy. We need to have strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the TV set each week. We have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they're going to get into next week. If I never see these characters it'll be too soon. Thankfully I can't remember any of their names (note to CBC - that's not a good sign).<br /><br />And the acting is so bland. It's more so a problem in casting than in the actors. None of these people actually embody the characters they play. They just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week. Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character the portray. Watch any American sitcom and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying. That level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows. But to be honest, considering the lame concept and the horrible writing, there's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture. As another commenter mentions, this seems like a TV movie and not a sitcom.<br /><br />And the directing or lack there of! What can I say, Canada has so much talent, look at what the Comedy Channel is doing with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Look at the Trailer Park Boys (not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog). Look at any American show to see the potentials our talent as that's where many of our stars go to find decent work.<br /><br />Give credit to the CBC, they really know how to build publicity for a non-event. Remember "The One"? No - well don't even try to learn any characters names in this show, as it's sure to go the way of the dodo.<br /><br />Let's all hope for a full blown ACTRA strike so that nothing like this emerges from the Ceeb for a good long while.	-11.725822555120189	-6.233557305325918	-4.701979068790977	-3.80499738032881	-3.712378869702458	-3.696463666583703	-2.4502045791853693	-2.098996238087635	-1.2786343389186274	-1.2519730666262652	-0.2556801930784217	0.5570619785970699	0.5863901399083311	0.6790889598770141	1.0459658606726585	1.2264150028473497	1.3078829619736592	1.3447963073405007	1.4521426381162545	1.4580864347206706	2.4600346379224627	3.0708998787106307	3.5188486569033004	5.957219457636838	13.733217522399727	
I had never thought the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent! The film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest.<br /><br />Saif has over acted. Kareena has improved her figure, but is not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. May I say the role wasn't good..<br /><br />Great deal of cheapness is filled in. Wondered if that was supposed to be the "comedy part" of the movie. Just because last few movies were flops does that mean Yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish? It has a history of so many good films. <br /><br />Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.	-3.09510598783186	-2.712276897499228	-2.233989372832654	-1.7839709982155598	-0.9434918122336882	-0.8689210188011499	-0.7745582295044268	-0.5241120544000253	-0.31548199627092555	-0.19064079231752387	-0.06302805751464174	0.14360822580478622	0.14480775831743298	0.28972562531586094	0.31522979648029115	0.328149626509199	0.35256140749676446	0.3540205240028229	0.5289552881175571	0.6944948028865383	0.7709983448866311	0.8276464517125749	1.7664776658429246	2.5021215943531496	4.304685473129272	
When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed. When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I realized a second point: communication issues. You see, when a dingo snatched Lindy Chamberlain's (Meryl Streep) baby, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were grief-stricken but didn't show it. As Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God willed this to happen, and so they couldn't mourn it. But when people all over Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started believing that Lindy did it herself.<br /><br />The point is, the wrong message got communicated to the public, and it turned people against Lindy. Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened. It may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet's political views.<br /><br />As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is equally great. You will probably get blown away just by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best movies ever.	-3.479080957019912	-2.2823163176654293	-2.14444263450146	-1.6183693345501955	-1.4172455513182554	-0.8792325056358399	-0.867964370665322	-0.24169091346197946	-0.048187119905424514	0.06303009345475252	0.18112473599050333	0.19080503533253315	0.2948283531158369	0.36921758219338485	0.44500399488702047	0.5035585914074397	0.5536026436858967	0.5829620185173987	0.7258280529303718	0.8284574342802592	0.8316745994176812	1.0787935012910408	1.9496144116569356	2.6918740498946763	5.855895309064925	
Plato's run is an entertaining b movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to.Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what i liked about Plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10	-0.517070539240971	-0.5073626779832296	-0.14439155738792192	-0.13090476028493503	-0.10918256969906352	-0.10519343216303967	-0.09012176181091006	-0.08708522298804033	-0.07755920383091755	-0.06296993820822155	-0.007110346748068463	0.005509430472280238	0.015900189922564634	0.027514940430604193	0.03590835293834042	0.043610993421209124	0.06614362933729978	0.08457847718002778	0.10353006809407617	0.12483560917630879	0.12708995495650233	0.18397487724886435	0.21580776472960023	0.23316288697955284	0.4475699645134784	
I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene. He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.<br /><br />Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie. He is just inspired.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. He has some really cool lines though.<br /><br />About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.	-6.512905951278235	-4.001924992764848	-3.8716388914001714	-3.049423658834931	-3.0027785238590834	-2.5198105389622647	-1.5223514092352872	-0.7858459505893627	-0.595022571982049	-0.47280417206462794	-0.35613213091977447	-0.19856527425365267	8.918386237226836E-4	0.33666708273282586	0.5008867203043162	0.619320316904809	0.7219920466174429	0.9762448026834474	1.1481649303089572	1.3755746540700011	1.387162335808785	1.6752225954570394	2.2992859751227024	5.095724366987715	8.614243268339935	
Kudos to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good -- it has the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that will make you laugh.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something cool, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's best Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Go watch this!	-1.7321129657083714	-1.0611346349818505	-0.5898010993417814	-0.45390763589523864	-0.3388888632434253	-0.3382242791228519	-0.20553688095375422	-0.16026184976346555	-0.07709542158586896	-0.06061940927413707	0.012308674968834574	0.240637709518145	0.32511075755723595	0.32903521407661135	0.3641615035663982	0.4647708603639784	0.4872822298847634	0.48763637890798617	0.541469724381257	0.9195120242156422	1.2085990871989645	1.226734130978895	1.2325161620588008	1.3589043517193806	1.4414023212691596	
If you're looking to be either offended or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess.<br /><br />Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels at producing. And once the "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!!" hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone.<br /><br />Unless you're obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really don't see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.	-5.15457628089459	-2.4423778536102145	-2.346503208213807	-2.281622877011892	-2.1915029781867603	-1.2829143796496014	-0.9724278337162559	-0.7776281511116936	-0.39288206689446303	-0.3203386168130209	-0.21474221761672438	-0.14765287739467547	0.10172106034698601	0.12899630354187225	0.2210659715193779	0.2752593640607315	0.41837704075849047	0.4670366608744795	0.5856986187825097	0.7036295538961612	0.8558073963922029	0.8982184972843662	1.799880848848459	2.7151055790947325	5.385711858478025	
As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. <br /><br />What I loved best, however, is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.<br /><br />Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament, the little liberties taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There's one little Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think Disney. The ending, as in "Miracle," is not some Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.	-2.7870458260952384	-1.953004917669073	-1.5999684920994905	-1.4146049996468668	-1.1951526513993276	-0.8811700055247038	-0.6502756478864302	-0.3254743782764158	-0.2694823447679872	-0.24913936739686376	-0.13275253417469732	-0.05295804696088592	0.05357870308648832	0.0859405005394756	0.08873116376075073	0.12175825017631245	0.3019488803902745	0.5074890942632779	0.5561711638595148	0.9586734543853228	1.0135229114924835	1.1019700087868054	1.1962931347181687	2.3028340669686775	4.198546156789361	
De Grot is a very good film. The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen. Some really top-class acting, not only by Van Huêt, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who mostly did TV-work prior to his performance of Axel van de Graaf. The film seems to kick of as a thriller, and sets an excellent mood. Then we start to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie. In the end this all culminates into an emotional ending, that will grab audiences by their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie. A must-see, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (The Vanishing's original screen adaptation).	-3.313339825905664	-2.130877109335404	-1.5938793039366437	-1.2828778536210252	-1.0695691025903409	-0.4633341717523348	-0.29057154334350677	-0.017861298702038703	0.217486027034212	0.22218423143334673	0.30476048342280215	0.3329947416050641	0.4907929679423786	0.512851397630283	0.5152866120810251	0.8582998955814416	1.068348942823797	1.0841146533438264	1.0987396664693525	1.3417183058337938	1.355065149584725	1.4368952271491506	2.5443381894040873	2.7330070262623822	3.3329027585530455	
several years ago i saw this film, without subtitles, on television, and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea, and the mood of the film fascinated me no ends.<br /><br />at long last i saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart skipped when i saw the picture in the television guide, and for 8 days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it. the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcock's vertigo. a slow, brooding film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend that disappeared years before. what follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot, and at the end of the film i was left breathless. i had definitely not got what i had expected (and i had actually already seen the film!). be prepared to be confused.<br /><br />9 out of 10	-2.7014269069504326	-1.2303850950833695	-0.7221938573000853	-0.6428949653279628	-0.5443619431021123	-0.5395273464984689	-0.5029107866270296	-0.4590050940655638	-0.45753711861669877	-0.36241712700298895	-0.3105229156130821	-0.14453991636736574	-0.07987917598704805	-0.07110984133114914	0.0319510184131926	0.2203250210336311	0.26730349093203737	0.3201026940639886	0.33749228097807393	0.3925485589078692	0.5027528164461582	0.5326782358972985	0.7806959380977664	0.920438727699455	2.3724251765952764	
This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film. Some good characters, but not many. Not worth wasting one's time.	-4.071558443318861	-2.083199460394519	-1.8503640737190175	-1.5819700090709883	-1.0206524522796747	-0.9988087160101083	-0.9509094306317508	-0.8415376257622885	-0.41989194805599644	-0.3138802556023976	-0.1974974265359996	-0.08630872542827299	0.08250174806967395	0.15356873512341027	0.3066910122442836	0.3216044213562976	0.39478478401305106	0.5445197184210762	0.7888743160889206	0.8109311081041377	0.8234796859207272	0.87423364136262	1.1951087363604966	1.9546554028655478	4.133372416932117	
Actually my vote is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it, don't misunderstand me, is not the funniest movie of the world, and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies, but this one has its own taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that not exactly but who cares? Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one its a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.	-1.1858355837081738	-0.7593515543445117	-0.36202377790950024	-0.30401512510154316	-0.27564248399506064	-0.23667197300417286	-0.1755533380446533	-0.16038785413176254	0.049899751515470964	0.05645397274811709	0.10612782038710737	0.1252911129642839	0.16077822822637866	0.20717696183661832	0.2073190902761994	0.2216165340724746	0.22540719859399283	0.3257737237622892	0.33071710716734354	0.4402431817627618	0.70793102883057	0.7620275386046904	0.8097470878817649	1.052806400071745	1.1510770907044592	
I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental. <br /><br />The acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and contrived that it makes Ed Wood's actors appear life like. "Sammy," the lone black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. His lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery, though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character. His old man make up in her other turkey ("Pushed To The Limit") is no-budget, junior high school quality, with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair.<br /><br />I cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video, unless people like to throw their own Mystery Science Theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand. It really is Beyond Fear-- it's actually Beyond Funny.	-3.0965645274050746	-2.1814584067670624	-2.0883565146510286	-2.029100795310328	-1.3469758204280748	-1.197318600228361	-0.9192042268837435	-0.8153003833496937	-0.6548018216974775	-0.05454256189570779	-0.0343167480632344	0.19041388675762166	0.20264700141552022	0.29182231891261967	0.33436285502026264	0.33734484986369906	0.3713883207292845	0.5270180947481999	0.8329088910854144	0.8747890366084435	0.8930746268237445	0.898170144835916	1.114763425587953	2.8597935071109624	4.256267005984078	
Happened upon a copy of this. Not mine and if I had spent my own money on this I'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back! All I can say is this would be a terrible student film. Any understanding of the medium of film is absent. Acting is god awful, the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to the 'ghost' is laughable.<br /><br />I can only agree that the 'glowing' reviews of this film are from friends and family.

I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor. In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role. Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved I purchased and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight. If you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance Mr. Waterston can really provide an audience.

Given the title, this first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff, here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as Noel Langley (though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected, much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled “The Colonel’s Lady”). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time), it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain.<br /><br />“The Verger” tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because he’s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! <br /><br />The second episode, “Mr. Know-All”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick), British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate)!; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford’s position if he were to tell, so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! <br /><br />As can also be deduced from the title, “Sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous (the ‘feud’ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie), one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naïve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ‘lifer’ while Rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar).	-6.980136923956911	-3.453843856890415	-3.21810798605013	-3.1547897682738775	-2.704515938666604	-2.2173340296363904	-1.9096574091047143	-0.5467749744188567	-0.4956946737981302	-0.27975918328110644	-0.17030335908402508	-0.0239314270112164	0.2268971616519571	0.25267948668812645	0.38266052709981496	0.42762693366496995	0.5064393210682452	0.5927048662424662	0.8342355784874876	0.9579018711345738	1.222933054147026	1.5218316318946628	2.3119667511791975	3.857070356072273	8.229718640914653	
I caught this film at a test screening. Was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story. Well acted. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male lead was awsome. Very funny film. Takes place in the best locations in New York. Made me want to go there. I just saw "You've got mail" I thought "It Had To Be You' was a much better story. Fresher.<br /><br />It was clean and great for whole family. I think it will do well. Audience I saw it with loved it. A definite recommend!	-4.130563773060491	-3.2391320359382236	-2.0064997086403604	-1.3515371669651322	-1.0719793749650106	-0.5250735807879734	-0.43865704447446413	-0.23589908711819507	-0.16278200604156334	0.07241804588663645	0.9165650130850288	0.9839950951684314	1.0011010393548232	1.0197726633048478	1.0454003601490756	1.0999041340397084	1.1956281775583735	1.581984735416426	1.7006459906385274	1.8996587515624155	1.9480004473728392	2.049203116551965	2.299642011366157	2.3376308146534313	4.68050930913399	
I am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie... I have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best.<br /><br />Even though ive seen the "making of", i still have doubts when watching those 35mins of pure torture : its that powerful.<br /><br />A 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do : be the best fake snuff film ever made.	-0.7212543614922124	-0.5704343765212888	-0.21211990380408755	-0.1547865931907534	-0.1303201468806549	-0.11429273158038065	-0.10254375968680324	-0.08955274319427456	-0.06478259832809302	-0.0060254994479200415	0.0738725442372044	0.11182852680947666	0.1214162321870321	0.17222313550321072	0.17550179485270836	0.1917318042524646	0.2138345808131566	0.2188769766554879	0.27473379082369576	0.2754398651264378	0.5938887642556889	0.6085022167331803	0.6266554269119762	0.7675507539034176	0.7986577015278344	
After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling. In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought that my profession was being joked about. I am not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but I do work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to "make-believe" of fairy tales.<br /><br />First, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model, specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are erratic and haphazard, there is no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about that in the 1950's. Even if there were a model for specific kind of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoichastic) one, meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction.<br /><br />Second, supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found, the model parameters have to be known. These parameters are the constants of the equations, such as the gravity acceleration (9.8 m/s2), and often are not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. And after the model and the parameters are chosen, they would have to be tested. Oddly, they are not, and by miracle, they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted.<br /><br />Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by Numbers, but also by sci-fi movies: the computational effort required for solving these models. Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a Herculean job. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models, he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow. And even with the right software/hardware combination, the model solution might well take days to be reached. He solves them immediately! I could use his computer in my research work, I would be very glad.<br /><br />As a drama, it is far from being the best show. The characters are somewhat stereotyped, but not even remotely funny as those in Big Bang Theory are. The crimes are dull and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent.<br /><br />For some layman, the show might work. For others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!	-10.550495108123886	-5.260087599331437	-3.9914573510136906	-3.366695790868911	-3.3659198977303624	-3.28036827455727	-2.917520185454191	-2.253720238982798	-1.291085131197968	-0.5311366510159463	-0.4937685787227752	-0.003029472696378023	0.6010417187877981	0.6701552551409317	1.0605363626744047	1.1278990425478568	1.1420915062121164	1.3314095840936628	1.8532723607564152	1.8731763239946164	2.1937482800639576	2.2625667348888254	3.2415328788943674	5.598332190966781	11.883652943472136	
The combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the Vindicator one of the most important sci-fi films of recent years. For some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin, why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by relagating to a bargain bin is beyond me. I have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire. Forget Terminator, Robocop, Aliens, and other films that blaintly ripped off this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.	-0.9194333616772389	-0.8272377986967409	-0.7651992486673631	-0.665584995538621	-0.6239361932189786	-0.52025129454468	-0.3426765942699459	-0.1380565011057596	-0.030446715980090147	0.021376696550487462	0.11477538599248271	0.15199021900327436	0.21453117420719756	0.21493803741463863	0.2193926911905008	0.24570950398315478	0.3361954778884816	0.3422374596844007	0.46498607661939195	0.503982862572842	0.5406839821891417	0.6051501287737829	1.1613934386900793	1.2956546446833952	2.184839049105114	
Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it. Blanche calls priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo) who is her other daughter Claire's (Madison Taylor) ex husband to see Isabelle, he confirms Miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle & an innocent girl free...<br /><br />Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching Blackwater Valley Exorcism & I kept asking the same question over & over again, why do I do it. Why do I keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder? Right lets honest about this, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of The Exorcist (1973) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share. There's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things, the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's, the worried parents, the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's, the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things. I suppose where Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (other than it's total crap) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring. The film starts with Isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either, the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out. At times I wondered whether Blackwater Valley exorcism was a spoof, there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed Isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a 'little prick' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back! There are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama, or it did in my opinion at least.<br /><br />According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on 'Actual Events', yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called The Exorcist... This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. There isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up, there's a scene of a cut arm, there's a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it. There's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive. I would imagine the only reason Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen. One pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it. There is zero scares, no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 I must say that I am wondering where all the money went, the film looks ugly & cheap throughout. There are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom. The acting is very poor from all involved, genre favourite Jeffrey Combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. Even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent, he is better than this.<br /><br />Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway. A total turkey from start to finish.	-14.475060621319644	-7.467719133727916	-6.947926081287706	-6.636915330999946	-6.42462627774671	-4.5318188303383025	-3.5607511436454153	-1.0755026462252375	-1.053730056466551	-0.9783311828026824	-0.9740473658469799	-0.6723018631318588	-0.14415761450343131	0.383401709335322	0.8183293376204367	1.270716425116551	1.2973886600101259	1.3489185786613218	1.5433804957698156	1.772795048941076	2.2964027918018872	3.2799767636149038	5.254510674696934	8.073999178253967	15.400865933955561	
This movie was excellent. A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie. You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way, Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This equals on big happy movie in the end. This movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be, so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. The cinema-photography is excellent, in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers. Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film.	-4.3810208247439615	-3.230306058721644	-1.6016853623888991	-1.247007468069099	-1.1938345322070631	-0.6139419834303044	-0.20695104861593644	-0.0028271123622449768	0.1848825712586688	0.2319423468450592	0.7374275345631809	0.7774474327942427	0.8463022632808566	0.9212069367878463	0.9964481757311668	1.1609506189839762	1.1901418716366339	1.376770492688399	1.5538790786670773	1.6113346986084323	2.1684682427804134	2.346207345641382	2.667314537815086	2.9589091663329348	4.429172071490652	
I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It is so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background. My friend and I just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other, "What's so funny?!!". Seriously, every time we watched that show, you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing. Just a blank look. So we stop watching it. I am personally a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But the show us such a disappointment. This show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever...	-5.839285615466787	-2.4289171080643377	-1.9713853556015803	-1.8494213107209725	-1.8442272607323924	-1.6051669030920346	-1.3231778824623701	-0.6485152434973441	-0.40458350020050243	-0.3077128935230075	-0.07685818964656937	-0.04447600363244697	0.1716479282579503	0.2436492983549119	0.24804109762000418	0.2837158971273446	0.2980075733353898	0.31830526595848513	0.45949494974932314	0.5443609609588796	0.5809909942761959	0.9238742718362297	2.6110905724994082	2.614399632331532	5.842383461250024	
This movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again. Jia Hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most. There's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression will understand Hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself. Others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary. Overall this movie is great and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this movie so did his Dad.	-1.8655595839514554	-1.251842619993578	-1.1589965527367985	-0.88647661944449	-0.7872746264492482	-0.6810684586713867	-0.3930555767471	-0.36800738131615646	-0.12637282880300882	-0.07912018992501241	0.02353448857290076	0.041097003708472746	0.06029280650894614	0.08168133372602372	0.19005639674752406	0.23110234180995015	0.3004000418197235	0.4696753761539607	0.4796816897257025	0.7010258286175778	0.9808256741881332	1.2886726174954652	1.6355671155281737	1.7903205606888721	2.61558755217335	
I loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed John Cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. But the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! Derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..Rogers also looks very strange. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he died! This movie made me want to turn it off, as much as i love the first one, i was very disappointed with this installment. They will never beat the original!:)	-5.0578569086651015	-3.5923424362118754	-2.1478178154554084	-2.025133370359937	-1.8505795571681058	-1.672116455273146	-1.5055474462227048	-1.0073146754454365	-0.8551792291652984	-0.6144543092919593	-0.4632765657787336	-0.15918038253377148	0.06335910989365653	0.14855919953461974	0.17443776624574656	0.2959805477238626	0.3229565546471901	0.45614983570986567	0.6342637541934968	0.6637553477430326	0.700403089659939	1.101850791338778	1.64225919277818	2.318893517050291	5.712418355605253	
The previous reviewer has said it exactly. I saw it once, was enchanted, saw it a second time when it was re-broadcast within a week or two of the first airing. I still remember some of the scenes. The setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is World War I. One of the scenes was set in a women-only section of a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all-time great movie moments. I don't think of this as a "gay movie," it's an interesting and tender period love story, where the two principals happen to be women. I would love to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD.	-2.650087852319836	-1.7479982356089039	-0.8336216125064739	-0.8105688270207255	-0.7324454694364148	0.008141665019416475	0.011149226567228901	0.04616873091688893	0.07976468528091811	0.08171337514824328	0.15741132216480652	0.18288280070253848	0.2065069506430572	0.24292839897453514	0.4102862088567542	0.44041259465124033	0.5576543255185119	0.6167407362631421	0.6259825637076158	0.6944767657069499	0.7152421605950932	0.8174982833264504	1.2408606916959923	1.7264483744818646	2.543744136968542	
The first half was OK, but the last half really, really disappointed. It's funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending, and it really showed. Whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this. I really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort. When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better remake, it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn. They eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama, so I started watching again. But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel, same with baltar and six was pretty dumb.	-2.2155351893906046	-1.7595531875865116	-1.6124865725081337	-1.5663327028343061	-1.4656326665223647	-0.8003048691641823	-0.6685894959469012	-0.6179965367795409	-0.4590483792225791	-0.21706669609425316	-0.18050639064320417	-0.13425856268735575	0.11486112077332256	0.16841940307423822	0.1880378502317007	0.29567743305156	0.3639981062307798	0.40265187755717036	0.45531263865301674	0.6868222082971351	1.198457814130966	1.2950084535666695	1.330362006400327	2.4247403813262203	3.584684969238885	
He's the only reason to see this film. He gives a very good performance--much better than this crap deserves. He's very handsome and very talented--he deserves better than this. Also depressing is to see Malcolm McDowell in this. He's another talented actor who deserves better but, like Esai, he gives a very good performance. So, if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch. Otherwise, stay away. One more complaint--couldn't we have had more scenes of Esai shirtless?	-1.483713689291143	-1.2459553643077776	-1.050885838143745	-0.6400743575237358	-0.55715121889949	-0.4376898973169243	-0.3001356441264894	0.07221904567023286	0.08519755216456786	0.10974857282654091	0.13091296960564053	0.16377893041291502	0.171803628981754	0.1904545058491449	0.21814423293047483	0.22454546549341867	0.24662078606838458	0.3132914370819697	0.4505976387215685	0.5063647742161981	0.6894333592198895	1.1769560733676199	1.6624891188542732	1.7922749912937928	3.007830384280113	
One of Keli McCarthy's best. This movie is filled with sex, and nudity. It has gorgeous, sexy women and some sexy settings.<br /><br />Believe me, there are many spicy and steamy sex scenes but not as hot as the women. We have outside settings, a hot tub, beds of course, and some other nice places to have sex.<br /><br />Monique Parent is great in the opening sex sequence where she behaves like a naughty girl. Keli is amazing, she's extremely sexy and performs in at least 4 hot sex scenes. My favorite is when she has sex during a picnic or something like that. She has this short dress removed and the rest you can go figure it out! Renee Rea also has a sexy sex scene where again, she demonstrates that beautiful cute faces can also perform great in soft core sex movies.<br /><br />The most memorable scene in my opinion comes near the ending. It's a double sex feature that has to do with hottub sex, intense sex! and Kelli McCarthy receiving it REAL hard so loud that the couple in the hottub feel interrupted. The scene is long, steamy, VERY explicit, and fun. My favorite from 2001.<br /><br />The other good scenes include Keli getting it on the woods (really kinky); then dressed as a bride. <br /><br />Renne Rea, always super gorgeous, dressed like a skater girl has a steamy sex scene. Nice!<br /><br />Please, watch this movie if you enjoy b-soft core sex. It's among the best from the new millennium. I had a blast with it.	-5.456081774924067	-3.623591433904878	-3.565029295721264	-3.182043299635745	-1.6345763856769626	-0.8159121759903437	-0.7965262211465965	-0.7000925158009602	-0.27354346039909266	0.48845473268728756	0.5646409189235356	0.778790914507353	0.7904150904133388	0.9709551462442733	1.206995903653998	1.2680274405273635	1.4869459092652944	1.7115305479138345	1.9726270515928093	2.1495903965362637	2.2505768661562384	2.2951083034221496	4.899643732801909	5.584678735387084	6.238954106071785	
It's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really, given the right circumstances. Street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing. The aging entertainer finds/buys a male child to pass his art to. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging, but free life along the river. Traveling town to town, he performs and has some degree of notoriety. Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good.<br /><br />Overall, the performances are first rate, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays the street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and downright strong, and withstands the overt prejudices well. The two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind opera singer, Master Liang (an interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned this film's remote similarities to BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); yet this film can't stand easily on its own, any resemblance is remote at best.<br /><br />My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the ending. It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for? What a shame. To bring a fine motion picture that far, only to surrender to emotional (and corny) pathos like that. It frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should've been. That aside, the KING OF MASKS is still very well worth your time. I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films. Highly recommended.	-4.032683069942221	-2.9903837025961537	-2.859434597963592	-2.36523740695866	-1.0726116760832765	-0.6203208566269913	-0.4871809225614695	-0.4058945167104303	-0.10307816798749178	-0.09184680882173268	0.1047262601202663	0.12850731249713296	0.23059423088251652	0.6429093835152854	0.6812687671357194	0.7502986709101995	0.9011320898169782	0.9389281448633985	1.0888212537047033	1.2328788468034668	1.986724763396487	2.171992190386759	4.144229021342292	5.034547922265513	6.692806825187483	
I had seen this movie before, but I could not remember it was this fantastic: it has a fun plot, Madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc. causing a commotion. And the music is just perfect! And the happy ending! Who´s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me. In my opinion this could be even the best Madonna movie I have ever seen! 10/10	-2.5949957314877405	-2.0371975774389512	-1.1409377443706485	-0.8542788798983846	-0.726110587435669	-0.2035396380544998	-0.13064275018235288	-0.12881083244985098	-0.012053497006412787	0.03362219174202757	0.06285879824668796	0.12488566562126704	0.13763208491158552	0.26513408592413545	0.3937750755223631	0.5182846047985831	0.6283733022024263	0.6428146607402455	0.8718035837127145	0.9126016664784846	0.9464342062424275	0.9475554283578881	1.532197171905911	1.5712072813470752	2.250822366124297	
Being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story) but this one isn't the worst I've ever seen. Yes its bad but its better than some of the others I've mentioned.<br /><br />Hulk Hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network. Let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture USA Network having Rip...and TNT will go to any lengths to get him.<br /><br />Does this make sense...no? Well don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense. Nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con have a REAL fight with Rip at the end of the movie.<br /><br />None of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later Hogan films its not so bad.<br /><br />4 out of 10	-4.140223379831098	-1.7890139708580894	-1.5605177113571647	-1.4144121941836456	-1.129150618117487	-0.9604633244333304	-0.6065161946760282	-0.5379645426422283	-0.38740830476741867	-0.3180463893115435	-0.31553688527670465	0.05783062842401532	0.1396471569750809	0.1909103011579473	0.24454708700116362	0.35554099801680833	0.37113593150049784	0.45910884590705175	0.5075017768475911	0.5130194862075604	0.5342849361096013	0.6854892288757481	1.4313039658163038	2.05317338531211	4.199185039549998	
I can't believe this movie only scores 7.4! This surely ranks up with the best of Hitchcock's movies such as VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think of why the score is so low, is that for the most part, THE MAN... renounces violence and certainly won't get a diploma in "sex and crime".<br /><br />What it derives its tension from is not violence, it's the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails. Today, having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as Mel Gibson's RANSOM, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, where family was all in contemporary America, the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot.<br /><br />And this tension still works for me, today. Yeah, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disturbing in how they act: It's a deal for them, and they want to be "good businessmen", disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera!! <br /><br />What makes the movie great, however, are the creative aspects, the kinky ideas of Hitchcock, the outrageously disturbing scene in the church (which brings it to the viewer's attention how alone, how abandoned the protagonists are, nobody caring, nobody helping, the people in the church just going home...), the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals (which stresses the somewhat "oriental" flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad), last not least the role of MUSIC in this movie.<br /><br />Music is the key principle here, as ***SPOILER*** the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tutti/gong; so Hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second ***BANG*** And then, of course, DORIS DAY singing Que sera, which became more famous than the movie itself; she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy...<br /><br />All in all: A classic!!	-3.435092546816656	-2.6247244641340997	-2.5820349182321314	-2.530666927667907	-1.9758645024251067	-1.5014572033891584	-1.2589705555499644	-1.100528037726664	-0.49466624041192797	-0.34130448343803244	-0.12399448314308492	-0.11269429169418399	0.005749389662185959	0.05919341881847591	0.2913711487860615	0.351722520139143	0.5652223587839081	0.6301711279447176	0.7089025599348835	0.7495452995914225	1.0102661109364695	1.189330661141683	1.2912766013341772	3.1864308397739354	5.093491774773087

This movie is one long chiche after another. First of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons. John is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation "it was always just the Two Of Us"! John would not have been mean to his fans like this either. Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something along the lines of "Sure and while I croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin". That made me laugh for days. Really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous. John and Paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during The Beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here. Forget it.	-6.0364195670032865	-2.803708213542759	-2.4575883751925613	-2.4252577511155184	-2.269932118653172	-2.0434872471870347	-1.854042323006541	-0.5956838848798007	-0.5536731398518512	-0.26066309898500817	-0.17342165501847243	-0.1398577313548152	-0.09937779675031379	-0.08885198385330667	0.24812338940245848	0.670624585128838	0.6950849090914312	0.706295208906552	0.8058535758983596	1.2037805921010243	1.2322803767989463	1.291903012699827	2.4465888401500018	2.947039037697616	7.017432926912954

Does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" by George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick in the move, It had to be you? He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving? If not I will have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /><br />I met my one true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it, I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. <br /><br />Altho, we did marry, I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years. <br /><br />He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out. I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years.<br /><br />This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love. I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me.<br /><br />I know when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will remarry.<br /><br />Don't EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED! IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE. <br /><br />Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for, if it is meant to be, it will, no matter what, IT WILL HAPPEN! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time around!

Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress..... But this movie was so horrible, I couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that I was actually watching something so crappy. Ha ha. The audio editing is horrible, They try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. Because they're just weird and stupid. The script sucked. Acting was horrible, storyline not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it is a 20 year old movie..... so I'll give it a bonus point for that. And yeah, the music was terrible. But we all got to start somewhere. And submitting these things is such a hassle..... 10 line minimum... bother. Well now I know why I couldn't find this movie in the movie store.... I had to purchase it offline to see it... good thing it was only $.58 cents.... even though shipping was $2.59. Oh well.... I don't recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film...	-4.917983595775635	-3.6781476956922954	-3.161973677595097	-3.0460614426182038	-2.4090679811758267	-1.2239623388679064	-1.1920594905518669	-1.053266118076974	-0.9015530949532525	-0.5846334878436235	-0.37949406567642596	-0.11790131980468749	-0.08746049421585082	-0.04689701566805474	-0.012009036836770019	0.025690290935112534	0.2773072430380173	0.31296731803699096	0.9959103175603241	1.3131600583976515	1.5043202921695595	1.8574870162662385	2.16730742447338	4.367898029605669	6.53756965179676	
Insanely well crafted mini-series.<br /><br />I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS. Was heavily promoted at the time. I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series.<br /><br />The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. Cut some interesting, but slow scenes.<br /><br />I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to DVD. Not worth creating a VHS version at this point.<br /><br />Would fit in very well in the mini-series or dramatic history genre.	-4.216857304420492	-2.2526513428628028	-1.7297459609016494	-1.2985916540320444	-1.1782125332279776	-1.1631446114806354	-0.6437696983211879	-0.3924406929915628	-0.362896953038306	-0.29494128145892345	-0.2297107898573113	-0.14559753123664004	-0.09296658318869361	-0.014696905103230781	0.4589021537640474	0.6659235427348608	0.6763288228816177	0.6792083761158612	0.7557921864086514	0.7809519540953335	0.8033543229904214	0.8472292224498885	0.893023650020365	2.0663126037743433	4.152409556971526	
I must say, when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, I figured it was well worth a view. I was sorely disappointed. From nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed FBI agents are, in fact, the killers. Could they have made it any more obvious? If that is the intended "twist" in this film, that's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. Pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem. There is no switch from "I'm playing FBI guy!" to "I just killed 12 people and boy, are my arms tired." You can't blame the actors... the story fails in far more ways than one.<br /><br />From the onset of the film, however, I was certain I was wrong, that no director/writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot "twist." Ormond and Pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer's attention from the real killers, I thought... which gave the film's makers far too much credit. I should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15-minute mark.<br /><br />To Lynch's credit, she did manage to interject many things that make a good film: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained actors. Too bad they were in the wrong configuration. Hopefully Pell James can recover from this role... I found her performance particularly impressive, as the stunning drug addict-turned would-be savior. She should have rewritten the role so the "crack whore" would win.<br /><br />Those people who have compared this film to Natural Born Killers, take note: Tarantino made the characters of Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, yet sympathetic. The artistry of that film far overpowers the gore, and this is not seen once in Surveillance. Surveillance only wishes it were Natural Born Killers... in fact, it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was. Folks who haven't seen Surveillance... stick to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.	-8.785961053986565	-4.759076722847966	-4.116532514682603	-3.8015904858850047	-3.747103724166077	-2.4533500990140675	-1.960222416740139	-0.6860971527676751	-0.6350788046663459	-0.5935383285621527	-0.3312278251612181	-0.23314053962655695	-0.14937847925129408	0.24505767068432535	0.35804391576583516	0.8074252647372777	0.9604588787617709	1.3093522693891895	1.672413702021693	1.8307203351348025	1.8565827988151278	2.311144540812248	2.349629267204486	6.0663668276703895	11.697476966942096	
I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.<br /><br />It's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's much cruder than the show." Does ANYONE remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.<br /><br />And as far as the plot goes. It was the perfect Dukes plot. In fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen.<br /><br />While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville aren't EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. I wasn't too keen on Burt's Boss Hogg though. And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a little... scary.<br /><br />And who didn't have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard?<br /><br />Folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't be sorry. It's just a great dumb movie!	-3.7316875801621947	-3.242795508461892	-3.124448795070673	-2.458098990940663	-1.4701098611072154	-1.2587378747053086	-1.1955204978361904	-1.081688241377336	-0.7178696326117983	-0.35312683251436827	-0.3237468388796864	-0.24738882023987158	0.16035907322674228	0.21495851601123475	0.4483580823721089	0.5035231117715517	0.5216579754402958	0.6547349111237419	1.1515807214955986	1.4115730858298274	1.663029957527593	1.9357404480390272	3.561709190863296	4.503319471462445	7.278486717789789	
Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.<br /><br />Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (I loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable ("I have to tell you a secret", Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...<br /><br />Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend.

Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" are going to love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat.<br /><br />Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.<br /><br />Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of "making up," and she's horribly burned in a fire, he's reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.) <br /><br />But Abbey's never been one to give up without a fight, and that's where the EC-theme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception. If anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.<br /><br />And that's not to mention that John Esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. You don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you're there.)<br /><br />Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! As with most MOH episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.	-4.990386897078197	-2.817268638770746	-2.6711859430177864	-2.289449683014828	-2.193262352527276	-1.7855005247921178	-1.5663600425559117	-0.6922176326289945	-0.4096318342616374	-0.3739111064897632	-0.34826992896351955	-0.25652866568740196	0.06344746088980875	0.3166235936927425	0.34455009524436264	0.5681989731329694	0.5941858807653506	0.6492122452000084	0.8541002490584488	0.8628033444637576	1.45265486436209	1.4547188081203053	1.5581656173288616	3.5426722001800037	7.080953009236446	
This program was on for a brief period when I was a kid, I remember watching it whilst eating fish and chips.<br /><br />Riding on the back of the Tron hype this series was much in the style of streethawk, manimal and the like, except more computery. There was a geeky kid who's computer somehow created this guy - automan. He'd go around solving crimes and the lot.<br /><br />All I really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally.<br /><br />When I mention it to anyone they can remember very little too.

I pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except Reba herself. She comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big Bully. And that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons Van becomes unlikeable too,like a spoof of his former self. and Kyra walks around sneering and being miserable.The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. Towards the end its pretty bleak.. In basically every episode Barbara jean Is walking around being dumb,Reba is being mean to her,but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants Reba to like her which results in Barabara jean telling Reba how awesome she is in every episode. I think it is pretty clear to see Reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. Its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential.	-4.394242414947479	-2.033807864929101	-1.9174142544009158	-1.7279398199824274	-1.5213069615718504	-1.3783789710832388	-0.8924146813209524	-0.7476283334404219	-0.33160707555360036	-0.23488573226997894	-0.20961056462542588	-0.11899137740869076	-0.08613972416573384	0.0666262837939037	0.21698312665052746	0.2483904545794478	0.29125121075484417	0.39628843298681604	0.40778459727884425	0.4643473913412743	0.5398111215725492	0.5506556907117316	0.9530096277785604	2.424518363079555	4.3482065361171625	
"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle." The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.<br /><br />*** out of ****	-2.670216901727471	-2.3793438676302783	-1.618741902700517	-1.4018708612061046	-0.7478145675959861	-0.32237512768499443	-0.13665311715318934	-0.062354990030854346	-0.05752171249452914	0.04416111056257565	0.09949787876110938	0.13160938115799473	0.33297523747246405	0.3413469889079356	0.37687281670311756	0.5387101749082709	0.5603428269080752	0.5834832498538502	0.7726661784305608	0.8775930120242678	1.3918476485575226	1.521090315691017	2.1401498443353235	2.997972500579989	3.1357459687990845	
I hafta watch crap like this all the way through to see if there are any redeemable qualities whatsoever to justify including it in my clients' video libraries. Don't you watch this, not even a minute of it, unless someone has a gun to your head. You will, as I did, moan & groan at least 500 times, and pray that one of the one- dimensional characters, all played by really bad actors, would turn and shoot you dead.<br /><br />Even if you are the biggest Sandra Bullock fan in the world, it is not worth even watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears.<br /><br />I want to kick the asses of the sleazy marketing people who put Sandra's huge picture on the face of this DVD box and have them thrown in jail for mugging me or something like that. I really wish I had the chance to read a review of this film before I bought it.<br /><br />Please, give me a call, and I will pay you $10 to remove this movie immediately from my inventory before it stinks up the whole place! (just kidding--please don't call)	-4.857175234363874	-2.476432685515344	-2.388090290037161	-1.9846239917542765	-1.9207669303584192	-1.0861123920559428	-1.0457044882322049	-0.6195691422492702	-0.5744022444816606	-0.2284765571483316	-0.190414779264863	-0.18473754461394085	-0.011966903409410597	0.08790641125717048	0.12660849785793746	0.1293627212943737	0.3001197525771206	0.31133112274197366	0.37870218043277404	0.6582093036761908	0.678793757535732	0.9695735226892198	1.5877602618643896	2.5547932679410796	5.181672309050837	
Christian Propaganda...Lots of fear mongering...<br /><br />This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction).The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn. From then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . The ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.<br /><br />The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture. The people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction, instead of god taking all the Christians to heaven. No reason to repent if its aliens. The deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose.	-4.055103461422139	-1.883323963887795	-1.8587440127578982	-1.4068403781511776	-1.367176434712942	-1.2759487215560406	-1.245048376595477	-0.44776233666838094	-0.35854322901739333	-0.23776450455488235	-0.1722032702204241	-0.15159736705181287	-0.1278404367395098	-0.00500692905156927	0.1902308992178673	0.26968811923339486	0.2760621953688507	0.7004617509471062	0.738887021293428	0.771634085450829	0.8020048337159127	1.1749918196555034	1.573475638036915	2.106407612479515	4.508151463634796	
Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike, and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe, which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.	-2.3459788179026635	-1.175724040657602	-1.0827750661240905	-0.9856708111649496	-0.9609574555408796	-0.6143504378407714	-0.3924014857623586	-0.3707030747197137	-0.3556136252845613	-0.30586837652297183	-0.24848191196166014	-0.058505301704589535	-0.02757740915215826	0.022095819385141303	0.03487142786526519	0.06948928028481163	0.09259990881501447	0.23996324224950777	0.260184452127868	0.3202570943902955	0.5141235560665892	0.549849833725421	0.7822821528209899	1.1666837066849167	2.29560560485546	
I love horror films, but I think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind (The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist, for example). This is that kind of film, and it's not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be, it is also really beautiful. A Tale of Two Sisters starts really slow, so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed. Actually this is not a ghost story though there are some. It's something more complex, and it's done in such a way that it beats Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring no sweat. A Tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits, because it really cares for its characters, and the direction is flawless. Every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you're the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie. The acting is superb, specially from the stepmother and the main girl. Those two are worth the price of the ticket alone. Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film.	-3.4754711014863475	-2.156366787993659	-1.4792689211892538	-1.423964982672915	-1.3612928658879329	-0.4303943927752174	-0.3471261927729244	-0.2604402002611924	-0.12916200650300078	-0.08883316085830639	0.04878403196547796	0.10221718866885679	0.3388448051763426	0.39817878034068843	0.8967809341820415	0.9440441506915982	0.9447907643212416	1.0997957223077621	1.2472696961300476	1.4538409206717247	1.6021163116582133	1.8191618701936163	2.071406266349601	2.261871449464162	3.0186363307398647	
The fact that this film was put out on DVD still formatted-to TV and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists......and rightly so. This deserves a lot better treatment.<br /><br />The story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft (the rules of the day) and winds up with a little girl instead (not the conventional way) ....and the problems that ensue afterward. The old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case.<br /><br />The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu)is kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin. The little girl "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is a cutie. The rest of the story is how the two manage after that. I usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes.<br /><br />Overall, it's involving story complete with drama, suspense, humor and sadness. Just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD. Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.	-3.1882887420953283	-1.9256927719107524	-1.7655107180520955	-1.3715543356012863	-0.9819961340367725	-0.7729260967396812	-0.7225223561105518	-0.6401560275244825	-0.3751447256765381	-0.06675814784092601	-0.061476516637267956	-0.037340229221700896	-0.004634120746084575	0.13392200985649078	0.14906953043727733	0.28026709131246774	0.3534135452244359	0.5236975111820936	0.5831636565544933	0.8350670073206079	0.8878702589334555	1.0484574695176159	1.7476467204343102	1.8441254875667432	4.001474375009876	
Another hand-held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about.<br /><br />Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge and you're close to the overall content of this movie. It's another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared.<br /><br />I certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie (does anyone do dreadful better than our Asian friends?) but the creepy moments, the genuinely creepy moments, were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than I had hoped. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared throughout so I certainly can't recommend this as highly as [*Rec].<br /><br />Having said that, it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that I had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down.<br /><br />Check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand-held genre releases of late. And the finale is a hair-raising doozy.<br /><br />See this if you like: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.	-3.4675027534381813	-2.317555635207616	-1.6656980662719492	-1.0120592340607109	-0.9982385007418976	-0.9262774971489336	-0.7165369139538851	-0.6549747743103085	-0.47847792403474815	-0.47417603579297213	-0.24852373557388993	-0.10361349673420965	-0.10104139705443645	-0.0038351523724867234	0.12931559397836373	0.33098058109879963	0.4137911654075702	0.44446791642295364	0.9124508984596796	0.9246323028854686	1.0334073186355275	1.1308911267778554	1.5592789361356816	2.400749789896453	3.982137076258428	
This movie should have easily qualified as a film<br /><br />that best promotes human understanding among people.<br /><br />It may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young Jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped German prisoner of war.<br /><br />Kristy McNichol depicts an amazing portrait of the unhappy, young girl thirsting for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and Esther Rolle, as the maid, Ruth, gave a superb Emmy-winning performance as an understanding maid caught up with these events.<br /><br />Bruce Davison portrays the German who is supposedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities. This is how his role appears. He has escaped, but he joined the German army and he might have been a member of the Hitler youth movement.<br /><br />The action takes place in 1944 Georgia, in a rural area. The townspeople are filled with prejudice. Even the FBI inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the Jews. Notice the opposite interpretation that as McNichol is in bed, Davison is hunted down and ultimately shot. It is interesting to see that society views McNichol as a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war. The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. Constantine's outburst at his daughter at the end is some acting. As the mother, Barbara Barrie, is given little to do. It was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical Jewish mother with that loud shade of lipstick on her lips.<br /><br />Memorably done and well worth viewing.	-3.5523095139951515	-3.3768198632209447	-2.9508241065101823	-2.6857785501860207	-1.3797096637056119	-0.8733719303568324	-0.8273156402937877	-0.6531405722196524	-0.4179405318820861	-0.18167460815874303	-0.07454027879755917	0.023574296866819194	0.1395940470742812	0.33810178993418044	0.42851388340940577	0.4395075841702806	0.4874341751757369	0.7069769250766593	0.8926610982680409	1.1109197905375159	1.2333320890422548	1.9970210505304071	3.136571680743376	3.6876492942520054	6.0934884208349525

Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of McKenna marriage(James Stewart, Doris Day, in the first version Leslie Banks, Edna Best) along with their 11-years-old son travelling through Morocco during vacations. In a bus they know a sympathetic French person(Daniel Gelin, in the old version Pierre Fresnay). While they are in Marrakech they also know a couple(Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing, the dying whispers a political message.Then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help to Morocco's Inspector Buchanan(Ralph Truman).<br /><br />This is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by James Stewart and Doris Day. This exciting film displays suspense, intrigue, tension, and interesting drama well written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett . Packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician: innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny, intelligent villains. Colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in Morocco and London studios by cameraman Robert Burks, though with excessive transparency for Marrakech scenes. Lavish sets by Henry Bunstead, Hitchcock's usual, and working until his recent death. Of course,the highlights are the happenings of the famous Royal Albert Hall of London assassination where a sneering killer, Reggie Nalder, tries to execute while composer Bernard Herrmann is conducting orchestra. Besides at the climax Doris Day singing ¨Que sera, Que sera¨, meantime her son suffering risks, the song won Oscar for Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone . The story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining. Rating : better than average, Hitchcock's enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it.	-2.3999207827127855	-2.3492799085709253	-1.345883705811776	-0.8879839097358294	-0.6915600632073282	-0.6594674607308417	-0.633456002610748	-0.37376132155845165	-0.33728565183265763	-0.022415429670713135	0.046952376504158434	0.09087160622227539	0.09619720523963472	0.2920522961781908	0.4951696676881897	0.5020468936733825	0.6629558605160989	0.7569674004800715	0.8695986884571656	0.9024693504948663	2.3234225124767143	2.3903087530143594	2.518532031152977	2.798906206061709	3.984138898362165	
This is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen. Even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, "Don't bother with us, we're all losers," you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. <br /><br />All the usual suspects are here. Besides the spunky teacher, we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids (they're brats, yes, but no so endearing), a slow-witted small town sheriff that they love to torment, an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team, etc., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d'Abo as the new teacher displays any likabilty. I never cared much for Steve Guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work with. Let's hope that writer/director Holly Goldberg Sloan comes up with something better next time out.	-4.846305997219302	-2.2415028652129165	-2.210929308520653	-2.092138478881823	-2.07565038004797	-1.353228859007522	-0.8307733672268512	-0.5976351628745276	-0.41560935816390754	-0.39847518056531867	-0.36068311735024267	-0.33245189737667585	-0.17029604607924886	-0.08729588441089721	0.22709896598840149	0.22963879265608994	0.2455211478835215	0.42391346224851423	0.5222272050955958	0.7081409116377111	0.7666332935562596	0.8477957522118709	1.4664820323757566	2.4909599911520846	4.717741249610894	
First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show!!! But this episode...this episode makes a mockery of the entire show.<br /><br />I don't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the WORST episode in the entire series.<br /><br />There is no story line, everything is chaotic and the jokes.....are crap.<br /><br />The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game..... For example "how do the furlings look like" by creating that stupid "previously on..."......is simply embarrassing.<br /><br />Its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad.	-3.843376226614717	-1.895078155195809	-1.882221879893384	-1.8498072485902437	-1.8276919395939344	-0.758179535246373	-0.6270429634297505	-0.34942295133432355	-0.3100543539340846	-0.28657420486129404	-0.26310914126472684	-0.15856074765176575	-0.10633526872690083	0.028184455833284897	0.060609351813476736	0.2937298201883902	0.3460887400678204	0.37979073231694654	0.43258078903157077	0.5012798612069721	0.6111515533631897	0.6175215708640021	1.3675414095634277	1.9128350021729443	3.7525509838654147	
Need I say more? The reason the GOOD Australian version of Kath and Kim was, as mentioned, good, was because of it's hilariously funny originality. The reason this new American-ised version is so terrible is because a lot of it is taken straight from the original. Not to mention the unfaithfulness to the characters. Kath is meant to be a dag. Kim is meant to be fat. Kel (or Phil as they have dubbed him) is meant to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is meant to be a loser, not a person who acts like he's on heroin and finishes every sentence with 'dude'. Thank God Szubanski didn't sell her rights to Sharon, she'd probably end up being a tall thin blonde who Kim likes.<br /><br />Kath and Kim are MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. They are not meant to look 2 years apart. And they are not meant to giggle like school girls. This show is a disgrace to even share the same title as the Australian version. America: get your own television shows.	-5.124810963876871	-2.056278289349302	-1.7531674059572577	-1.5992387704908377	-1.470970589884415	-1.3794825377068745	-0.8666070324619988	-0.43150786680947534	-0.3386839703576033	-0.09226190063469422	-0.0887639621968817	0.06227924020197355	0.25938235273724547	0.2875881932780324	0.4088796437505215	0.6844427181844235	0.723878772850794	0.7247605694289002	0.7441924808635662	0.8223676179138454	0.8336350059696579	1.1831450261357692	2.1392643171536623	2.3408708810316403	5.842614223780169	
Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. Heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did pretty well with this. If you can find this series, give it a look.	-3.599068602753438	-2.8169692480976534	-2.65065032330339	-2.087223776996598	-1.3153392786673994	-1.2188908943210905	-1.0175117861542624	-1.0170858588454175	-0.4246597956939939	-0.34717716798860143	-0.12848676692253508	-0.11088206910843794	0.15468826967022292	0.3155932813685639	0.6364502088918326	0.6899853726964166	0.6965459537619391	0.6966043405129124	1.0348489819879452	1.1095537289120871	1.4328845877101657	1.7659051004998105	3.493479798215589	3.6392296542216633	6.016770608692268	
Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. The three businessmen take revenge, which escalates to a murder after another. Supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people.<br /><br />The plot has too many holes. The details were ignored in order to move the story forward. The acting was uneven. The color balance was awful even though I watched this movie in DVD. The small budget and tight schedule were apparent. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight, and the ending was just unbelievable.	-4.339062465112674	-1.7285839393582734	-1.6154742700284326	-1.4218119364525224	-1.2716577360036125	-1.145575755590361	-0.8257316058855331	-0.7939841770404241	-0.571185749647381	-0.43155757413991247	-0.3407192664651034	-0.2950484478305861	-0.1964993376877609	0.036445408640732174	0.08653086536487062	0.4083329395725206	0.41288819766067153	0.43168002350168144	0.5343201111621287	0.5608960998528774	0.5792021797462059	0.605501827525412	1.4271437751594283	2.9362088553924317	4.272183912661572	
There is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men. One sees it in television adverts and program plots. Cheaters is a prime example, they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men, why? The prime threat to any government's power resides in the male population, they're less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat. A way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big-jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum. In Australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges, another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance. Cheaters, aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, furthermore most of these women assault the men! If it were round the other way the men would be in jail!! If it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters, because they don't normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat. Men's mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway.	-3.3687099058941326	-1.732229675904458	-1.6705654655106537	-1.3685178252903616	-1.1670161228153013	-0.9732861711998082	-0.86948848835975	-0.5283966435638026	-0.4976378552850207	-0.47543795767216146	-0.005195301009476093	0.057751521346342496	0.33461128166154597	0.3398446923979644	0.35701549782640085	0.3760127445150499	0.42628708443858504	0.5177409276473668	0.6244102291786905	0.6760821456087827	0.7648459744555948	0.9310732602766276	1.4685930986577718	1.6239644083575995	3.7847517689061667	
This is Clive Barker's masterpiece in my opinion. The movie has a great storyline and some amazing make-up and effects. The one thing I would love to see happen is a sequel. The movie was set up for a sequel and with improved technology the second movie could be incredible. David Cronenberg must appear in a sequel as well as Craig Sheffer. But this particular movie was a great original, creative and entertaining idea and I could watch it over and over again. Cronenberg was perfect in this movie and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the film.	-3.927710455504856	-2.786903071977397	-1.655580698710224	-0.8406580913332937	-0.8383168589377994	-0.48954919247057715	-0.10095413757912053	3.253121749701789E-4	0.20282438410994183	0.47007316673166033	0.6766853837402764	0.6844673378308661	0.7695141989949942	0.8702604469111607	0.8896239488967996	0.8916603073168499	1.181396970518763	1.2314118147808693	1.379818714495773	1.4700690355846184	1.5909655025281557	1.8450736777982848	2.2969615325599375	3.0997363834739433	3.8179820801518547	
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. In fact, I just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. But no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. I'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which I don't care to ever see or know.<br /><br />What accounts for my hostility to this movie? The characters are not believable. The plot is not believable. The pretentiousness of the movie is sickening. Basically, every element of the movie rings false. Buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well-worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life. However, Buscemi was badly mistaken, because this movie contains nothing new. It tries very hard to be depressing, but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it, because it's obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world.<br /><br />What IS depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards. Disgusting!!!! Bottom line: stay away from this worthless film at all costs.	-8.1057557845401	-3.196655178569734	-2.9005267159771644	-2.787049634225867	-2.7536560257916705	-2.683384724973912	-2.054833237980216	-0.9970168949148849	-0.6140283665729407	-0.5594628567828338	-0.5386800854103242	-0.0936820816625297	-0.02349574017114414	0.08195794315686089	0.2710090953705009	0.3648455829731161	0.5400832396269487	0.6414546478753324	0.6444631403465365	0.7838011106476911	0.8111973435589133	1.3213569458346295	3.7164536664698735	3.894270524671283	8.416559965951397	
I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box that I would sell for $2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies' success to ruin it all with this load of trash. Why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk. The story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood, that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this movie and Cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips? This movie was so bad I thought for a minute it was Death Wish 4.	-5.5575508362866195	-2.7730363214290703	-2.435749777104687	-2.190421239060682	-2.014311928291705	-1.782467981211037	-1.7785753183044335	-0.42548992279662357	-0.3902459359016618	-0.28699226023134045	-0.28126837047083786	-0.14935993384842572	-0.1404042107042623	-0.07731959507296306	0.2644343671928776	0.3344076290165714	0.37860605481551385	0.40991475246763887	0.7990485335753235	1.0980979979010377	1.180283006922561	1.1989551899414361	2.782533018834615	3.0262054531217473	6.030005970850704	
I put this second version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" to my Top 10 Hitchcock movies. Together with "Frenzy", it's probably the most argued film among the fans of Hitchcock. I consider it far better than, say, "Rebecca", which has gained unreasonably much appreciation.<br /><br />The film contains many ingenious scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but that's something to be expected from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but that time is used for preparing the following happenings, which are full of intriguing suspense.<br /><br />If you can ignore the clumsy rear projections, the only weakness of this film is the main villain, played by Bernard Miles, who is a rather flat and undeveloped character. Luckily, there is a creepy assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, isn't as irritating as most kids in old movies.	-2.9586393703586626	-1.8252953735780397	-1.7678514675444084	-1.2565240018756776	-0.9901630677631054	-0.8759859634642773	-0.6259222108324385	-0.43138703333960665	-0.2872904181237041	-0.2446024717681014	-0.10190893260003961	-0.0835626703713907	-0.030010788802274563	0.07017413012880233	0.08035788256794713	0.1437404809881417	0.2496550526447422	0.5347866511639611	0.6340514157255889	0.6614883744971298	0.6832153705969717	0.6894952660927266	1.1651116994510882	2.239403951493213	3.752147699892664	
I enjoyed The Night Listener very much. It's one of the better movies of the summer.<br /><br />Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the entire cast was very good. All played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is great as the Mom, and never goes over the top. Everyone is very believable.<br /><br />It's a short movie, just under an hour and a half. I noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.<br /><br />The director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.<br /><br />Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads. It is not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie was the ending. The director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but this is a minor quibble.	-4.734073118079471	-3.8428112417880924	-2.51184678533983	-2.3538656348040576	-1.6195107646213074	-0.47330597408126696	-0.31976497876150073	-0.036947914748327315	0.4591785084856102	0.5441190881200197	0.78590238251843	0.7889098505555185	0.9447280893908275	1.0895837449236385	1.1604751466741952	1.2031847768541923	1.312720731033779	1.399489560167411	1.6684958932042753	1.6879986095605835	1.8894793834740968	1.9429930189247144	4.225576839695814	6.0697462834714875	6.196548929506753	
This movie was extremely funny, I would like to own this for my vintage collection of 1970s movie must see again list, I know this cast of characters ,they are people that I have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy, unfortunately this was never put to DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx always a clown of comedy, Pearl Baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy, Norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out,Dennis Dugan crazy funny man . Miss Dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience. Love,lust,strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance ,situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake, I do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible,except Jerry Seinfeld playing Dennis Dugan role, this earmarks a couple of Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman is that you ,keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent. This movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie, remind me of episode Kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer. ( episode from Seinfeld ) The parents have there jaw dropping moment, fun over fun It is screaming bring me back .	-1.7003983319792682	-1.4869773167532663	-1.3413627358766398	-1.255599781800327	-0.8682506376120067	-0.5286581996053116	-0.48668452106477667	-0.3946414110546469	-0.2668996121233973	-0.19007056656910412	-0.13841945412006532	-0.13365534170425278	-0.12730386961457396	-0.0680422185616581	-0.061802724305343205	-0.03552939434662384	0.005755971950628481	0.07321569647034243	0.36557184811987137	0.386519359681105	0.4263914652452936	1.0461975046193377	1.3662497449192579	1.5737732694933362	2.3611592173870903	
Certainly this film has the ring of truth about it, as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a Marine base. It deals with the attempted cover-up by the local Marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a Marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend, a Marine captain. The man and woman had been lovers, but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married. He continued to stalk her, going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time. Finally he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife, and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed. The civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense, but the Marines decided to charge the captain with murder. The major, you see, was a decorated hero from Vietnam, and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the Marine base. The captain, too, had made some enemies in her motor pool command, rejecting some male advances in a very butch style.<br /><br />There is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama, which the very capable cast gets across nicely. The director and editor, however, seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view. You're lucky if you know where you're at most of the time. Bear with them, though; it's a worthwhile story as the captain's court martial trial unfolds, and it seems every man's hand is against her, even her attorney at times. <br /><br />The verdict? Well, after all, this is rather a suspense story, so you'll have to see for yourself. There is a kind of "pacifist" message folded into the film, but forget about that. Sure, "war is hell", but sometimes it can't be avoided. We'll need those Marines then, even if they aren't always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins":<br /><br />"It's Tommy this and Tommy that, And Tommy wait outside. But, it's room for Mr. Atkins, When the troopship's on the tide."	-6.613899128156615	-3.5469672460888857	-3.544263857162942	-2.429913464602442	-2.3603844501064453	-2.3156373036046123	-1.3024991226609013	-1.0917864254030882	-0.8307885580414206	-0.4802189986651694	-0.2785706431960498	-0.0779136335493062	0.145247632726698	0.28055885525096075	0.46664445116107917	0.7530647159673335	0.8595629699882886	0.8734508201486724	0.8983564926295773	1.014676743423084	1.178479787111175	1.647659954594681	1.986250899224853	3.703825209352544	8.236518954527536	
I broke my own rule buying this movie from the $5.88 bin at Walmart. Basically, if a movie has a big star in it, and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. Well in the case of this movie, the reason is because it SUCKED! They plaster Sandra Bullock's photo and name all over the cover of the DVD as bait, and it reeled this little fishie right on in. I was thinking of donating the disc to charity, or giving it to the library, but I don't think I would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie. Worst lines: "What do you mean army buddies?" "What do you mean your dad?"	-2.7684312069476915	-1.1408139206540078	-0.9907246504316057	-0.81288113498261	-0.6174181142511856	-0.6151273420544277	-0.6135141736915807	-0.4515976806579156	-0.42725294657224	-0.4151352707241775	-0.29965727220540544	-0.056520881935592814	-0.00516619267002337	0.046216362734443364	0.2124537669251436	0.21448967370171013	0.27845866014763876	0.28010853805460667	0.34075090688272064	0.3826511623134996	0.5341100503714439	0.7072375271005418	1.0298159280515766	1.1437129722184012	2.740811725286766	
I first saw this movie when I was a little kid and fell in love with it at once. The sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious: "You sons of a thousand fleas".<br /><br />It is always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3:00 am once and it had just started. TV companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time Sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work.<br /><br />10/10	-1.2524519469522475	-1.0054947368936946	-0.9991494341942301	-0.6040251619448896	-0.41226787446000046	-0.3540076742463162	-0.29156869604670643	-0.2675587944404959	-0.03320627803138655	-0.020905495128757792	-0.01180384692323698	-0.006032799580296469	0.021317552910211597	0.07079844222311374	0.28345033437970624	0.34524460709167415	0.348718667825683	0.39063713809111295	0.39649940768578323	0.39714744254391604	0.42756511773944605	0.4945089473424277	1.1693202460129317	1.2902165106022716	1.581061421809669	
The Golden Era of Disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s. This show Quack Pack shouldn't even be considered a DuckTales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with DuckTales. It's about a teen-aged Huey, Dewey and Louie as they make trouble for their uncle Donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in DuckTales. I prefer the little adventurous nephews from DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There's no references of Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring but the animation is good. If you want lots of slapstick humor, I recommend this to you. If you want a better Disney show watch "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".	-3.2712541685414855	-1.5983811150378873	-1.382404133883247	-1.2142507089663186	-1.0805218160307692	-1.068919972272594	-0.9219270528232772	-0.5841039648608743	-0.42965369918299245	-0.31317757390233125	-0.15530468758547278	0.041855124342251186	0.09906398139517152	0.25229719052202526	0.2784849171851511	0.29837398781539587	0.3200017499056221	0.4380537769439673	0.510046144147743	0.5478863899923845	0.7831458281930244	0.8352622815528411	0.8521432363715112	1.8277747416185461	4.17024915430875	
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.<br /><br />The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. Watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.<br /><br />Speaking of drag, another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it up.<br /><br />Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.<br /><br />p.s.: make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.	-7.610040185626955	-6.290536048447765	-5.945276308715292	-4.074241960293074	-2.806950189963805	-2.4321171500551144	-1.915765131818044	-1.4641948691044548	-1.0402723088332002	-0.6957506970121433	-0.3251201681204996	-0.08460749038818144	0.10830868505640356	0.34763021763295576	0.5482212044470475	0.60640957934245	1.0594345669984315	1.1311725139264408	1.4506074423118347	1.996357172239105	2.8991098915804727	2.995234148788527	4.955295148245778	6.357590874451286	12.117528429565818	
Unfortunately, due to a sluggish start, I can't say that this is one of Hitch's best films. It very excellent none the less. The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back. They both give excellent performances, not surprising of course. Really, however, I was most impressed with Hitchcocks amazing use of music. The climax at the Opera house was fantastic, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius. Absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene. Also, the use of Doris Day singing "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film. So, this film to me ends up being Hitchcocks best use of music that I have seen to date. Unfortunately it had a slow start, or I could have recommend this film a little more highly. Even then, it is still well worth a look. 8 out of 10.	-3.1579163398771253	-2.783411415255326	-2.604082835353444	-2.0118884908728267	-1.7221667687793925	-1.476563734223909	-0.5210341706218589	-0.3909124677021295	-0.07950681460659728	-0.021507502583374652	-0.00572311897796067	0.1028824000692315	0.3536311599720875	0.4424031434773734	0.554368418870177	0.5614648120221482	0.6524132490039413	0.7045424031637627	0.7173598125987929	1.4196255056460128	1.5092954324239725	2.161585053368905	3.291088136210269	3.7830295146237747	4.8604792082220785	
One of the first OVA's ("original video animation") I ever bought, this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles. A cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set against an unlikely (for a comedy, that is) background of near-future pollution in a dystopian society.<br /><br />The "heroes" of Dominion are the Tank Police, formed with a "if we can't beat crime, we'll get bigger guns" philosophy, and who are, like the name suggests, patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these cops are borderline(?) psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase "loose cannons".<br /><br />Equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries, terrorist Buaku and his hench(wo)men, the Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always seems to involve giving the Tank Police a hard time.<br /><br />The animation is not state of the art, but it's very nice otherwise; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion.<br /><br />The English dubbing is, again, lots of fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that...<br /><br />Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. It's Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy, filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations, making sure that it never takes itself seriously. Highly recommended.	-2.430870592739863	-2.155298682413229	-2.1418997636410873	-1.5794025997693653	-1.2662459364506289	-0.790390474692552	-0.7205303563095191	-0.5390095213496406	-0.47154701430206925	-0.22994465102326272	-0.1292265404095589	0.14993299965183304	0.1658203980617942	0.2750530402065835	0.4688550308886036	0.6190430220475241	0.7224869130177015	0.7920957716306152	1.2101721961950973	1.2161567404638611	1.31985110558181	1.6202428143733125	2.662623470472452	2.8934799213336193	4.06564289130342

Well not actually. This movie is very entertaining though. Went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the "I think there might be something in my eye" routine. The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. In fact all the characters are great. The movie is not overly funny or sappy, good flick to go see with the wife.<br /><br />All in All 8/10....note * I am not an easy grader.

Fantastic, Madonna at her finest, the film is funny and her acting is brilliant. It may have been made in the 80's but it has all the qualities of a modern Hollywood Block-buster. I love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes.

This is a very, very odd film...one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself. The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance. Additionally, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.<br /><br />Later in the film, he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head. Oddly, this is only half-way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life. This is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor's novels--one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them.<br /><br />See this weird film--it's amazingly compelling and not like anything I've ever seen before.	-1.9252830288239886	-1.9194019883813023	-1.590045400893624	-1.5550358916588438	-1.4204086644517684	-1.0827389115275927	-0.7811757161187456	-0.6878909250643233	-0.3636694312745311	-0.20069095020009248	-0.12071068008263704	0.1816225853436846	0.20164667046201626	0.39870093298524556	0.482004364341906	0.5038072351164108	0.6174000842924384	0.648975943075598	0.6676439392567841	0.7678196429698259	0.8271123067017299	1.2503253102598775	1.9500240629664976	2.5533565819359	4.22205022894097	
Despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. <br /><br />It's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says "Isn't that clever? Am I not smart? Isn't that biting social commentary?" And,sadly, the answer is always "Ummmm...no." Wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality. Thankfully, it died young. Empire Falls falls flat.	-5.439128623989151	-2.3229411817239667	-2.0279649651103084	-1.8599005769647536	-1.7197706924029146	-1.5715242538359644	-0.8853235053999551	-0.8221111580092428	-0.5727201605391562	-0.2994253372797152	-0.25870628642220495	-0.1450036081419222	0.050092438608386594	0.10159323113205909	0.23713291073390322	0.34434848539545587	0.36822856367440515	0.4438047276871875	0.4936651314110103	0.5040997235686815	0.5321746728179246	0.6288795744850499	2.481920853838883	2.899439703584351	5.565167694797108	
This picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by Daniel Boone in the wilderness of Cumberland Gap while being threatened by hostile Indians. A treacherous Frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace. The film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes, although somewhat violent for its time. The cast is comprised of B actors but they are all good, especially Lon Chaney as the Indian chief. Bruce Bennett is okay as Boone but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a frontiersman. The dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the Kentucky backwoods.	-0.9655531366189622	-0.9561933153415301	-0.7286938607424542	-0.6081247988288656	-0.4922364061678355	-0.3593057379173752	-0.24134837128388328	-0.2175243938598762	-0.1966148609196095	-0.19347817723081157	-0.10832869446461268	-0.08948830023998869	-0.08484896301998819	-0.0642172635842498	0.011043906868749676	0.022304923634496474	0.05583295448505127	0.17494963572125657	0.4270869638895033	0.4873686529403427	0.780939012742204	0.8726562562072606	0.8877170734385991	1.0568058263555975	1.0896548417524903	
Saw this film ran in the wee hours on TCM. Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw. First, the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed. <br /><br />The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. It is too bad, because even though the script left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell both did fine in the film in their roles. It is a shame the large chunk is missing, but what is here is watchable.<br /><br />I just wish it was all intact. The script makes little sense in that Bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the time lines don't make sense either. There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in World War 1. All the acting by the support folks in this film is fine. Just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film I could not see as it was missing.	-5.219133128096613	-2.080870692247761	-1.8374226876244786	-1.7657995984819759	-1.6953349856128304	-1.1941624252154546	-1.1331227960412442	-0.9001777283350696	-0.6971191476614187	-0.6461057118744105	-0.5579380695480933	0.10390575468651905	0.25585994952942825	0.3049434916688003	0.4352778280266438	0.488173573902392	0.517493870241873	0.5238768801955846	0.630185419259794	0.759710122507102	0.8294495490507481	1.3492652294273597	1.8245189944957956	2.3519880394421326	5.504301745426775

One of the best western movies ever made. Unfortunately, it never got the recognition it deserved. The storyline, the action and the music was in my mind, one of the best. I give it a double A+. Randolph Scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast. The ending was one of the best of any western made.	-3.3425677747039773	-1.7061661807103512	-1.214603198673904	-1.0434932995776847	-0.7326548830915232	-0.6396582052206348	-0.05495836762486339	0.11507997424580824	0.11851394248464658	0.2554365492596627	0.5095036929596278	0.516062058732979	0.5594811641388092	0.5839994788301032	0.7527748944847898	0.8427260087200995	0.8592913237304209	0.9778567086703611	1.0373549507849753	1.1199298238936912	1.3519233603792489	1.362427583773322	1.9083495727635955	2.2232566788209964	3.1469235886198432	
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened. Half the scenes are pointless. There is not an inkling of character development. The score/soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I only rented the movie yet I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances. It seems like the bulk of the budget was spent on putting a few name brand actors in this less than bad film. This movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club, it tries to get you excited and interested but just as you think something is going to happen your thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you arrived there.	-5.032695926622077	-2.535280241890999	-2.047543826624882	-2.037335966564938	-1.8606244567358412	-1.647265964903132	-1.6043872243413146	-0.2291476842431997	-0.17704838150330143	-0.1056098793817172	-0.09037822625034331	-0.0731080620820368	-0.016135751165580275	0.08764917614133262	0.10066362866954867	0.21085056188886023	0.3473716596826536	0.480329083375961	0.8487899030562268	0.9305592018143205	0.9697578062419177	1.0820861249232259	2.4126279929474372	2.555285448443673	5.320429518899403	
<br /><br />Spoilers<br /><br />I'm going to be as kind as I can about this film (some people, including directors!, can get quite upset when reviewers speak their mind) so...<br /><br />There is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and... that's it; everything else bites the big one. All the acting is appalling, the script is embarrassing, the special effects look like they were done by school children on cheap computers. All in all this film has serious bowling shoe tendencies.<br /><br />As a horror film it's not very scary and if it supposed to a "thinking man's" horror film well it succeeded on some level, I kept thinking that the end of this film is an awfully long way away. It may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and I'm missing the point but I somehow doubt it.<br /><br />This is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and I could not recommend it to anyone, and it does pain me to say this as I eagerly await the resurrection of British Horror.<br /><br />If you don't agree with this review, that fine, it's just my own opinion, and I'm sure someone out there will love it (the director's Mum for instance).	-3.850097177517126	-2.9963588226404356	-2.8689535464090934	-2.732403658767878	-2.558250624352888	-1.6617438859115392	-0.9557187362038833	-0.7575197266012227	-0.6875352810195534	-0.5884510627141749	-0.5729743225353061	-0.4758504188259383	-0.47100271867930216	-0.10908236848681793	0.4114719323987145	0.4917858922106375	0.5484492544975835	0.6416757362314278	1.3220923841667036	1.388049075211374	1.50407594760888	1.5095121368195605	2.2344341403717727	3.473615375688629	4.974213314597861	
Hey guys and girls! Don't ever rent, or may God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the Oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc. I can't actually find ANYTHING worth the money spent to see this film.. Maybe except all the cats, which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute. Please, use your money on other things than on this film.... I couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the film, it was that terrible.. If anyone really liked this film, I would REALLY like to hear from you, and I will try to see if I can get you some counseling at a psychiatrist's office near you..<br /><br />0 out of 10, actually below if possible.. Not worth the DVD or tape it is on..	-8.332963812482484	-3.570416888042833	-3.0422817350933746	-2.9871439132777935	-2.746925892090428	-2.616564801537108	-2.597876431634364	-1.7848775703080595	-1.5883297702365637	-1.1994614856025134	-0.4868052612638456	-0.46773628477093165	-0.27927745925361236	-0.26565877735974885	-0.10589948982958924	-0.10077998501304009	0.16170562304724187	0.38169601183848545	0.572981371718731	0.955563736374714	1.0791161445792463	1.646146418241834	2.528236796388787	3.7391070886015294	5.989512878742052	
The story of the boy thief of Bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of "Thief of Bagdad," to less imposing, more recent attempts. The best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. Those effects still work their charm.<br /><br />No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.<br /><br />Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.<br /><br />Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)<br /><br />Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see "Thief of Bagdad."<br /><br />This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. It was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.<br /><br />"Thief of Bagdad" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind.<br /><br />9/10.	-3.6966644895665044	-3.5609067549031628	-2.855749563031322	-2.7143005109662006	-1.6223855487031222	-1.2852490834974462	-1.1996260955775744	-0.6548209539989235	-0.576603739757586	-0.28486728716932685	-0.05068660120138306	0.02138853541797455	0.2231521767751854	0.3461518346111587	0.43104119281978287	0.8598373131661218	0.9335815052631871	0.97151902779333	1.755200349245533	1.826219149305544	2.0310789685563333	2.125609491773331	4.089319804155503	4.322868775725887	5.546762240940782	
This movie really is that bad, and I'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have waded through every title from Full Moon and Troma, all the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD-flicks from faded men-of-action. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a vast array of the movies that MST3K covered, but in their original form. But you do not know truly awful film-making until you have seen Darkhunters. And if you haven't, you shouldn't. Don't bother. Not only is this movie amazingly poorly written, directed, shot, edited, acted and splattered in crude, cheap aftereffects. First of all, it's a pretentious mess. But not good, Greenaway or Lynch-style pretentious or hilariously messy in an Ittenbach or early Waters sort of fashion. It's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart. Sort of like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), only that man seems like a freakin' messiah when compared to this trainwreck (and this coming from a rampant Shaymalan hater). It's also boring. Not heavy going-type boring, which is okay, if the movie awards your patience. Darkhunters does no such thing. It's boring in a "Oh my fu(king God, if I see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue I am going to fu(king kill myself!"-kind of way.<br /><br />Btw. anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed.	-11.48033967206183	-4.899857895707944	-4.449213871116346	-4.4430943033269426	-4.4156285884843	-4.218108491441791	-4.05594511499376	-0.9896060846323316	-0.32016820593370304	-0.2200406979678885	-0.017916355075952524	0.02686563478952614	0.11338197146783496	0.16771020072794862	0.3465033370280691	0.6216740032762054	0.7430780679896424	0.84629685854334	1.14256432798896	1.229738156471116	1.2347145162529352	1.5810067119563584	5.6605716408061735	5.857170919051355	12.180986607402911	
This movie should not be compared to "The Sting", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly, hugely recommended!	-1.25685318293385	-0.9038053419375323	-0.7141226964698484	-0.5866363548631068	-0.5252582124671197	-0.5009262899104441	-0.4784623297077789	-0.24731228962171192	-0.18316419705871098	0.031170939610592086	0.09564603019667291	0.14672623848245855	0.15215854691559177	0.19638545722283518	0.21925633688633595	0.3404761752438238	0.3622827474558145	0.37599105134937716	0.6126139579820449	0.6203632216046029	0.626057300342826	0.6496136048718167	1.621520611060412	1.8103922502779306	2.794243684617319	
Well, was Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns? This film sure was better than that bore, "Oh, God". I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. I, for one, don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I was rolling over this one. Well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best.	-2.525364547890006	-1.6168319853193331	-1.324682398658923	-1.2783979567031507	-0.9795037033445264	-0.7908868328156757	-0.7745390790244349	-0.1579949705535783	-0.05988482800391488	-0.04154313052979153	0.014290061195388282	0.029159518518301064	0.09172145186807576	0.10959499753246249	0.13481184598978307	0.15461845929971735	0.17217561395385383	0.3759143867844773	0.5075705031368458	0.6574808889207704	0.8567133035725409	0.9236811989626554	1.1465507339273975	2.2030253962685586	4.051883757690005	
They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station. They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived. You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration. Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once they're grown, it's easy to spot the writer/director among the four. He's the quiet, contemplative, long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants. This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Only there's no writing, or directing talent on display here. And if you still can't figure out which one he is, here's a hint: The auteur and his character have the same middle name. It took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school. What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal. Once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father. How about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else? Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose. Howlingly bad dialogue. Many scenes badly out of focus. Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience. Overacting in the extreme. And if you don't quite get the self-important speeches, or the slow-motion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music. It will clue you in and what you're supposed to feel. Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films. The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies, run over puppies chained to a tree, rob and steal, all the while complaining about their sad, sorry lives. But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college. Yeah, that's the ticket. Why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important, so interesting, that the world can't wait to see it onscreen? If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems, then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants.	-8.871281038801591	-5.042233132940079	-4.183786785991734	-3.800698684391109	-3.477882665651208	-3.1338059462179726	-2.3142638029485303	-0.7331750823260973	-0.44735638538445627	-0.1877212677197388	-0.16080167571363563	0.02177681231500676	0.1538443976858341	0.6567584999991125	0.6747746052244176	0.9467177272576011	0.9578612736507531	1.1838164926929176	1.4572273372446463	1.6202986054589126	1.7904265814962423	2.6389004717663553	2.996704885961834	5.534400929276068	11.467343492853535	
I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I lurv Steve Buscemi.<br /><br />I remember when I first saw Buscemi's full length directorial debut, "Trees Lounge." I enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was -almost- there. It -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see "small" movies about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" towns. It was close enough to where I would say that it was a very good movie - one that with a few tweaks could have been great. But that's OK. I like the movie and I've watched it more than once.<br /><br />But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It's about "Lonesome Jim." When I saw the description of the movie and then I saw who's movie it was, I was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that I knew that Trees Lounge could have been. But what I actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy, heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation.<br /><br />In other words, this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that I wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state - the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning, or if you happen to be the floozy, waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile. The film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with store brand white bread, no less) and the emotion of a cadaver. I am not sure what the point of this film was, and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission. Sorta like those new cars that don't come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). Overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film. I mean, Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. <br /><br />I blame a lot of this on Affleck. Why do people keep casting these Affleck turds? They suck the life out of anything that they are connected with. One Affleck was in one decent film (and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent) and all of the sudden every butthole named Affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script. People pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two duds together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum, but oh Steve you let us down. This film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper.	-8.222090691148443	-7.611886861195527	-5.135263809191001	-4.768247099943593	-2.8370810093923864	-2.440833581853187	-1.8819131063205525	-1.1306270025091179	-0.8162471263613253	-0.41155139543280683	-0.3925183890402195	-0.12175747529614679	0.2583989000291034	0.4873999730310005	0.6785045018300867	0.8109254493430097	1.105999893683681	1.2579566687978125	1.2674080232833878	1.2895197179689373	1.7305942230926359	3.0459762429954207	4.205939071194575	6.047279186263073	10.975546860444087	
This movie definitely shows something and sheds light on what happens in most institutions today, and shows how one gurl just with the help of her newspaper manages to get things done, her editor has complete faith in her and doesn't publish something important, because it would harm her friend... and when it was the right time she took the necessary action.<br /><br />The movie overall got a rating of 9 from me , because its got everything, i mean it keeps you entertained, and moreover, they have acted really well, for a TV movie, its really high quality acting that deserves alot of credit.	-1.3733473129516127	-0.6202388041036819	-0.4084850036209195	-0.2815409509252027	-0.2113567334985031	-0.1910006948809446	0.011761256163637948	0.060359181640917275	0.13161897193190386	0.13484942386362359	0.14332741536617738	0.1514361926615441	0.17070997739693958	0.17304227220598783	0.18092133998815357	0.2675821187202161	0.29185194179537777	0.3394548223014256	0.4579193102716348	0.49085909795503396	0.5098817683467163	0.5278426042448386	0.5510972278067369	1.1683372758592276	1.1724083733568433	
What's inexplicable? Firstly, the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It's a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.<br /><br />But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10.<br /><br />p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.	-8.24818576808709	-7.93626560486618	-5.723966254649732	-4.598884553779677	-3.663374693421355	-3.4186862385392542	-2.5259833137961323	-1.5867402562939064	-0.32981246085157534	-0.2026558678739317	-0.03501344890227032	0.04891149722455534	0.1483602660522055	0.20241294028718834	0.30032522659735544	0.6924742313541256	0.9709695293281351	1.2173340613257233	1.6544421538401315	1.6823979755413396	2.2123950885384422	3.1059871184551504	4.713638787696001	7.529179723178777	14.042719497035408	
I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza,s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave Hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the American Caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it. see the film you'll see why Mr Lanza still come up in discussion even in my house. Someone says Pavarotti i say MARIO LANZA.As for the film itself when will it be on DVD they must have it restored and VHS isn't good enough but this should also be the only Lanza film put on DVD the others are down right bad and boring .	-1.6633816016804315	-0.8103708003654905	-0.7371839632968076	-0.7294537502469235	-0.6450381847818221	-0.5581714902873909	-0.35063806664453834	-0.2844539091101808	-0.13176192969153938	-0.12127066871569403	-0.0836405124118198	-0.02518442641790014	-0.018675949206820454	-0.005811898270308924	-0.00190163323879243	0.013453509769043168	0.08066631714639325	0.08870031343415816	0.14219110990908487	0.3048895111381292	0.3571016686721817	0.4197452474343945	0.508525474082958	0.919431024013877	1.7887625199822352	
This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I hadn't. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, though I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I wish I had. It disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors. Unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes (which would be impossible) I would in no way recommend this. Its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I don't think, as many people say that it is, that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily unfilmable, but this particular rendition could have been done without. I'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice.	-3.0384784104856553	-1.836887417892474	-1.8367437527232489	-1.6937979140623691	-1.4527202315981846	-0.9294983768067953	-0.9198932622761509	-0.3101232692747813	-0.19482927791174326	-0.1734802031189333	-0.16824761721619516	-0.11933979064924581	0.03642392725327219	0.06969483231670986	0.0872339199402126	0.09309377420136816	0.13800724753791005	0.5928691350380473	0.6603854879363149	0.7257329306071466	0.8016848991731127	0.9515983391693734	1.2250692941203778	2.637599017340472	4.087220200445867	
Nightbreed is definitely my most favorite movie, I've worn more than one tape as it is. The make-up is awesome, the story is lovely. It takes a few different twists and isn't quite as deep as the story it's based on (Cabal, by Clive Barker) but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material. The only problem with this movie were the producer's vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie, hence the changed ending to allow for sequels *eye rolls*. Apparently someday we're going to be getting a Director's cut that will (I hope) clear up this bit of nonsense. Until then, I'd suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to Freddy/Jason/Micheal type slashers. I really don't know what would be comparable...	-1.8743192790845051	-1.29155198141452	-1.2767788203821409	-1.0302628705479213	-0.9340015467390954	-0.7187604338093667	-0.7034846307636411	-0.2308051434162109	-0.19801433032873567	-0.027786655140215263	-0.02206445955114166	-0.01587993544782621	0.12468418257164365	0.2394004094347072	0.2670380011598277	0.3289935641238153	0.3583052087392689	0.3668907315579486	0.46695880081721514	0.47130344169537025	0.5141149407802171	0.8199261729860929	1.2997740143902905	1.74986421189342	3.5461496831084722	
Can you capture the moment? When first you hear rain on a roof? Some things are beyond the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. The things that matter.<br /><br />Poet Dylan Thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible "A good poem helps to . . . extend everyone's knowledge, of himself and the world around him." (Bob Dylan named himself after him). So why has it taken so long to make a film of the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopic could have missed the point. Writer Sharman Macdonald has taken a different, better approach.<br /><br />In The Edge of Love, she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them. The lives of four friends. Dylan, who lusts and loves to the full. Wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller), his feisty support. War-hero William (Cillian Murphy), who saves him from a street brawl. And then there's his childhood sweetheart. Vera. Dear Vera. Take your breath away Vera. She's Caitlin's closest friend. William's wife. And, like a muse, the 'star' in Dylan's dark sky.<br /><br />It all kicks off in the 1940 London Blitz, with bomb shelters in the Underground. Enter Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) under makeshift stage spotlights. She meets Dylan for the first time again in years, her heart is flushed. Their eyes shine through the smoke of the room. The purity of their former passion. Dylan (native Welsh-speaker, Matthew Rhys) is no sanctified, sanitised poet. Master of his vices he must experience them all fully. He introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo Vera.<br /><br />The Edge of Love is a visual treat. The soundtrack leaves you wanting for more. Performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers. As a lush love story it's pretty good. As an insight into Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not bad at all. And as a tribute to a great man, inspiring.<br /><br />The production has been at pains to project the spirit of Dylan Thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much. Dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. And it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of Albert Square.<br /><br />Sharman Macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer Rebekah Gilbertson (granddaughter of the real William and Vera). "Think of all the things that you don't want me to write about," she said," because I have to have carte blanche." For Macdonald, the limits were if she should cause offence to Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the limits are those which wife and family could set on them. A woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues, and will even put her children's interests before her own (This occasionally happens the other way round, as when towering genius Virginia Woolf refused to let loving Leonard bring her down to earth - in The Hours).<br /><br />In spite of the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become closest buddies. It is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film.<br /><br />The film's colours tell a story in themselves. In a drab, wartime Britain, Caitlin and Vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey. Shortly after meeting Vera's lit-up-in-lights stage persona, we encounter Caitlin through her searing blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railway carriage. Her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity, triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with Dylan. But Vera's lipstick red brightness is less enduring. For her, marriage is second-best, even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband.<br /><br />Outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images, in a manner similar to poetry's juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning. Horrific war scenes in Thessaly are intercut with screams of Vera in pregnancy. Giving birth or is it abortion? We are not told immediately. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day.<br /><br />Constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites. It reminds me of Marlon Brando reading TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. A different way of seeing things. "I'll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no-one died  ever," says Dylan to Vera as they walk along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin recalls childhood with Vera: "We're still innocent in Dylan," she says.<br /><br />There's a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, perhaps.) A time to be inspired.

i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics.<br /><br />overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess. the movie was quite short though (around 85 min.) but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially jason biggs) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace.<br /><br />overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating. hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright, it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it.	-2.8366475592868756	-1.718817676704267	-1.308562823901842	-0.9806275415271882	-0.9008278195010969	-0.7758816713311938	-0.745785007632408	-0.4978339788878362	-0.2512380479578951	-0.24924810237724293	-0.12714919626157856	-0.05739529176931373	0.15958346409998478	0.19811550777016385	0.20852701989169214	0.21063406276713365	0.2663031129344211	0.5040080269165181	0.5822958735358845	0.6230575095555728	0.8566475181665554	0.8584958585871425	1.0945515587340802	1.9203737741511513	3.829978455958345	
All credit to writer/director Gilles Mimouni who fashioned this winding, twisting tale of deceit and betrayal. While keeping the utmost control, he maintains the audience at arm's length, never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on. Even his clever denouement has you guessing.<br /><br />The three central performances are also top class, with Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role. To give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair.<br /><br />Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma, and Cardine Biggerstaff's editing keeps the story a step ahead of us. The theme from Peter Chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script.<br /><br />Many may say Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love. For me this is simply a haunting, elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such tantalisation. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending.<br /><br />Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon<br /><br />No-one does thriller quite like the French. When they get it right, they really get it right.<br /><br />Vincent Cassell is intriguing as the deceptive Max, Romane Bohringer obsessive as the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot from Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires.<br /><br />All credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot, and the performances from the three leads. As Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional.<br /><br />Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video	-3.0513173099615147	-3.0114700763159976	-2.4267067498217303	-1.9949702628613688	-1.4404169515748508	-0.7260262141412257	-0.5511091605457237	-0.3257405518918801	-0.30870143419830165	-0.3015468656043506	-0.16302867883635888	-0.11349144757409052	0.12235331638046093	0.22874928727864235	0.3050714287498352	0.7312032602425342	1.0345338183591797	1.1407435917810138	1.2418579318068248	1.3622507488743922	1.376413528560979	1.9081758391504562	3.3577560291233333	4.302832867181264	5.354693394858886

When the Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become Tom Black Bull, a champion bronc rider. Raised in the old ways, Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. Bitter about the role he has been forced into, Tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story, which is about where the movie ends. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas. Oh well, you should read the book, this movie doesn't come close to doing the story justice.	-1.417424918979618	-1.4143764185421877	-1.1533015927087993	-0.7614681384916571	-0.5489085160750314	-0.4201561972115535	-0.38339490667062137	-0.2737389467594668	-0.17532299728344938	-0.16769705610114055	-0.1154528241716931	-0.09442197527243551	-0.07741070832366478	0.013735341309883554	0.06678328810363557	0.10783217772456816	0.21639739379782913	0.25358851855181064	0.4149543253005419	0.4227634319681796	0.46363209913189946	0.5936532400840215	1.0685094614703032	1.1571079404455116	2.078941722915115	
Eric Roberts "stars" in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut prison film. He plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. Though evil by most people's standards, his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with "Lethal Weapon" electric prods.<br /><br />The movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's squinter eyes, Dolph Lundgren's one-liners, the acting abilities of JCVD and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation.<br /><br />Martin "Cobra Kai" Kove's career shares this low point with Roberts, in the film it is difficult to tell if Kove's character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if Kove just came that way. I couldn't blame him if he did.<br /><br />Fortunately for all involved, this movie has a "so bad that it's good" quality that can be fun IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER TO DO.	-2.9110414987492734	-1.5711245915702985	-1.1785521001309451	-1.044314253514073	-0.8988686024586852	-0.8365036835798838	-0.8108221552034057	-0.43815724900044545	-0.30504415979933286	-0.15349876667126555	-0.0563584605037299	-0.037572646785916014	0.07649645224419821	0.1965479820670686	0.2540945191987637	0.36646440753720383	0.39507678650576483	0.4172984535318293	0.4517084431722496	0.5974338200381993	0.6799862746003711	0.6843609601517114	0.7292222387793783	1.6925197293020249	3.366611613887777	
Tim Krabbe is the praised author of 'Het Gouden Ei', a novel that was put on the screen twice ('Spoorloos' and 'The Vanishing'). One of the Dutch writer's more recent works is 'De Grot', a psychological thriller about two totally different men, Egon and Axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life. Egon is a quiet, somewhat dull person, who spends his time studying and writing geography books. Axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic 'party-animal', a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom. From the moment they meet, Axel has a strong influence on Egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything (such as reading thick books like Egon); ultimately, Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country.<br /><br />After having read the book last year, I was surprised the critics were quite positive about it. In my opinion, the book suffers especially from the complex structure. While Krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle: the many episodes are not presented chronologically, so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode. Because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote: you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her. Another complaint was the fact that the main characters, Egon and Axel, are a little stereotypical. Egon IS 'the' dull intellectual, while Axel IS his exact opposite. In real life, such one-dimensional people rarely exist; in books and films, they always seem to be there, taking away a lot of credibility.<br /><br />Despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book. The adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography, humour and acting: Fedja van Huet (Egon) is one of the few Dutch actors who can make you forget he IS acting (which is, in my opinion, the highest an actor can achieve). The drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the book's: mainly because the characters are one-dimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying. Guess who wrote the script? Indeed, Krabbe himself. It is obvious that this talented director (that's what the movie makes clear anyway) is hampered by a deficient screenplay. Perhaps Koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.<br /><br />7/10	-7.758375386840401	-4.030319662764247	-3.8858676674839847	-3.3743602624136058	-3.2550924176717873	-1.9019456742293226	-1.865953379277821	-0.5489897750760981	-0.48049627912565607	-0.43817822972251597	-0.3428615180285897	-0.3175842495430101	0.25978963670958577	0.31562811565979	0.4432688180227075	0.5398721743313132	0.56763134531155	0.7451544212730972	1.2507534412571395	1.2786688791414935	1.7649062395828576	1.7911975510823055	2.0328174864546646	4.469642512750095	9.541526324351924	
This movie is amazing! While being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception. In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him. As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was truly there. This movie was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, "Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble addition, "May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out."	-4.820395348414127	-2.1602060992214236	-2.0781315726624108	-2.018576644069309	-1.4234704904273694	-0.7505321939703002	-0.6091174935502928	-0.6012843470033421	-0.24646047201550156	-0.1751339940708351	-0.04658572952854595	0.019407596100844207	0.06686765297880697	0.2624142672909743	0.43697264000537955	0.6670161466530937	0.729460490681226	0.7951965869881789	0.8165075584358576	0.9031743281063744	0.9265370887060336	1.4930698526399029	3.2190958706067847	3.61523838660331	4.749773692563821	
This is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships: playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice) and the fools who may be indeed in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien).<br /><br />Max and Alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark. But as the profusely discussed ending tells us, as veteran players as Max and Alice were, they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship, only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers (as far as what we were shown is concerned....who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen).<br /><br />This is a very fast-paced, delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast. It also deserves some deeper thinking: how much is real in a game of relationship?	-1.5877674817013845	-1.4405515615250377	-1.3142381567928905	-1.038740863799233	-0.8627940685980271	-0.7270093664169979	-0.6273710358326363	-0.39986564295947513	-0.3152643450751381	-0.2481860333085824	-0.054949463618408245	0.0657058287496734	0.08876800486731433	0.09286994264117474	0.24784180751341384	0.2739422952891475	0.3971845366951403	0.6332843880206734	0.7616554897779368	0.8080148102807759	0.9075388019603199	0.9430664511829394	1.7685248478423494	2.1624633534617876	3.222894385224336	
I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of "Before Sunrise" (1995) and "Before Sunset" (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why.<br /><br />Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and Julie Delpy (the Three Colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris. They meet on the Budapest-Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.<br /><br />The film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. The characters of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (Celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half American-half French, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.<br /><br />All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.	-2.268028424024671	-1.7263633056044045	-1.5908058903819653	-1.5025770715933655	-1.254983877847556	-0.6548299287086722	-0.5477189864723023	-0.45827318640591225	-0.3866484001869638	-0.31706003022593765	0.03501718184782773	0.13976999096753445	0.22192788127724458	0.25979260516054403	0.34157011166402895	0.39793995917720104	0.5969446439640571	0.7396459005084226	0.8974230883581984	0.9533982345650802	1.5275849712075966	1.8062788159177998	2.069873181240427	2.574444904663185	3.914451509154753	
This must be the worst thriller I have seen in a long long time. The directing, the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time. Within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery. I guessed this within the first few minutes and I kept hoping I was wrong and much to my dismay I was not.<br /><br />The film starts off with two FBI agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a cop. They are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day. Each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better.<br /><br />Spoiler: The whole story ends in the FBI agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them.<br /><br />Why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place? How did they get away with pretending to be FBI agents (when you discover that real FBI agents had been killed and their badges were found on them)? How did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras?<br /><br />Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end. Maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not sinister in the least. The character of the young girl is also wasted potential. There is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal. She does not appear distressed, but rather detached which again is not explained. <br /><br />Awful film on the whole.	-9.516236773112006	-4.354170238792973	-3.9647856068061165	-3.851099463722899	-3.5937913761117737	-2.9678893434879474	-2.456985027651485	-1.390384728862175	-0.6766307373090908	-0.665631449338814	-0.482954883552125	-0.36584165207355507	-0.050513532989636595	0.1709157345669266	0.3070049240535351	0.4638678971219139	0.6179139758560146	0.6257174533067515	0.7441410513845663	0.8759220586394492	1.5620539520340349	1.7941324953377908	3.9763247390736414	4.686842292012172	9.954894745250813	
These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, reaching 70th minute I was convincing myself that it's only a few more minutes, and I lasted to the very end which I'm kinda proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for human's patience and crap tolerance. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and if you're strong willed enough, you may even last to the end... The movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all. All happenings in the movie, you can be sure you saw somewhere before, and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel.	-2.714190187245798	-1.5209254900349198	-1.4195427141238282	-1.3721949862425287	-1.27411940776821	-0.8918524082735333	-0.8299448804285472	-0.2826015864705435	-0.23208059174788742	-0.1944453711734563	-0.15503257249378555	-0.14261870396919013	-0.05480074679707237	0.02685744101935726	0.07479603892094291	0.11490990932814266	0.15069620638529718	0.17459211093421292	0.2796518207677423	0.37626484124936954	0.7328937000692802	0.7418398294523143	0.8303725110678104	1.7379718130408308	3.3344179945269157	
To be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the Exact opposite. I realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a Muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing. It also show's how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad Muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time, like how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like "Blow up" or Yaser saying we'll blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way. Being a Muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act. I am glad a show like this came on the air. There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists,many people do find them funny to my opioion it is OK to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair, but it is done to often and really gives Muslin people a bad name.	-3.468962899291845	-1.4633697290473897	-1.3476492307562637	-1.3384468815489508	-1.2657943124927349	-1.2331227734785493	-1.199392979722712	-0.43251969655412587	-0.33572282120065483	-0.21056957392906	-0.1412435646409045	-0.11623266611889271	-0.06813692020222573	0.029368704725833875	0.07522263738754663	0.1863328545704357	0.1925371897591664	0.28518513712348376	0.31717609188065327	0.507726102227086	0.6084947194347622	0.8268734527582804	1.1747320447393115	2.041910822571099	4.000781950944957	
It's heart-warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males. In this one the wife/mother leaves her family to "get in touch" with herself - or pursue her libido. The father stays with and nurtures the kids, letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them.	-0.7894858098577906	-0.3877238433993826	-0.3872252922479099	-0.2864740915781352	-0.23530116365833478	-0.19892161614757117	-0.1460897255819753	-0.07845418156166153	-0.06908890552064456	-0.03743142203242359	-0.010751159524910653	-7.059976585735601E-5	0.004837914593423295	0.008712534435371469	0.04599004424527296	0.07297420628107903	0.13300689703815785	0.16281527387449207	0.1645366468078135	0.16914486013881733	0.19818261396327969	0.3633624855610257	0.3988321025461485	0.5806765559761058	0.7309961644267331	
I just got home from seeing "Radio." I've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time. My kids are ages 8 and 5 and I would like to take them so that they may "feel" the message as I did - you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are, not judge them for their differences. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris both deserve Academy Awards for this movie. I don't know why we can't have more movies like this, rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis.	-1.884624637975123	-1.1959724517167039	-0.7549520266855383	-0.7142497415855709	-0.6593275184831047	-0.434053438579334	-0.14721403443095032	-0.097904399828772	-0.07745717470692211	0.09152108326983853	0.10590488509612198	0.12645374730047787	0.14110791159346997	0.191560875449165	0.19456931521180357	0.204174575581004	0.2160892542165747	0.29683134665497174	0.30629455183033	0.3550705524100884	0.642718065187601	0.7296502514518641	1.1474473806385643	1.2365543610565646	2.4088815962341474	
Perhaps I'm one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so over-hyped! Films like "Ringu" or the "The Eye"  which are praised all over the world  simply didn't convince me and they looked more boring than frightening. Well, this blunt opinion doesn't go for the South Korean gem "A Tale of Two Sisters". This is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror-tale that REALLY gets under your skin! The plot, based on a local folklore tale, might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all-time greatest genre achievements, but the atmosphere and tension-building surely provokes feelings of great respect. This is one of those few films that are impossible to label: the events in "Two Sisters" qualify as mind-bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait. Besides a mesmerizing story, "A tale of Two Sisters" also has all the great elements that I feel are usually missing in Asian horror films like compelling music, good acting and innovative camera-work. The mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door. Several sequences (like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls' room) are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I do like to believe that I've seen my share of spooky horror. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is a terrific movie-adventure and a definite must see for Asian film fanatics. A little warning for people with a short attention-span, though: this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time. It's also a film that requires repeated viewing, even though no one will never really "get it" for a full 100%.	-2.996347310438672	-2.679094611429557	-2.45130274921034	-1.8133218961763204	-1.420919954650953	-1.4183123659886565	-1.412174317296801	-0.936861529661208	-0.8394106173585305	-0.10372152765086434	0.010763046116568697	0.048399879529746885	0.27473626553507263	0.33407813627069927	0.4687828422417947	0.8045206146031492	1.025823900863958	1.0398444345415583	1.225671700544689	1.4471815977377593	1.5173009546745437	1.79036985104749	3.192982982418816	4.201493205673812	5.308512097568182	
I have to start saying it has been a long time since I have seen it, but have seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical/comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence. Kay Kyser's mysteries would be a good example.<br /><br />Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action, doing a fine job of support. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to Lou Costello and thus, Abbott and Costello replacing the leads. Don't know if that was true.<br /><br />all in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have that much Spike Jones and his band on film for history. Wish that it was released, as I haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades. Hope it is not lost	-1.3639277675738144	-1.2996879674570687	-0.9221833468403272	-0.5909617693893944	-0.5528818922013344	-0.46880206400260144	-0.32514615208819625	-0.2462907905793971	-0.15579888461134808	0.041899354342504115	0.057857667880228614	0.20567751803245865	0.26662772688076913	0.3528462580133817	0.37454501899899834	0.435840838001741	0.4603965414939595	0.54102677200543	0.7366239850070343	0.7721658404870362	0.7836270979373929	1.052293087109168	1.6002067334412007	1.6806379115693069	2.6547485757441662	
I of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lion's Gate extravaganza, so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. And it is, to a point. A young college student (Sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them, and in doing so she's unwittingly becoming involved in some game. Now that's fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated. Characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is hanging out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's "all part of the design". In reality, it's all part of the "very sketchy script" and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time, like cleaning the bathroom, for instance. 4 out of 10.	-1.9930079578541298	-1.8231308868750022	-1.5693417772438791	-1.3426980014387677	-0.7649922303015373	-0.6345902928633449	-0.6197771960259778	-0.36953782388288015	-0.14631360548888256	-0.13994585027239953	-0.12389385371314568	-0.12251625331340388	-0.11136769918201316	-0.018139871541323835	0.10506334539090985	0.13801324385618105	0.2045643932881966	0.22742336037444974	0.43068622460573364	0.46217055109674315	0.675987628460704	0.9729684157533351	0.9769149791336054	1.8263388461513888	2.7414286878881304	
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can again see it.<br /><br />In the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with Gen. Leslie Groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the Manhattan Project. Most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past. <br /><br />The casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding. It was the first time that I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor. Except for height he looked very much like Robert Oppenheimer.<br /><br />The early scene in which Oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me.	-1.316346427837984	-1.2765590360417456	-1.1813685449221158	-1.0928879040995492	-0.5341167664233823	-0.31580106573444244	-0.2884550798407603	-0.1800691490059544	0.011654757866200058	0.015071402007581898	0.07343249247439174	0.1294780428614767	0.2346764897098201	0.26387875691866103	0.27649988124404085	0.45074223261165713	0.5875308422951797	0.5879068028750122	0.620831292462853	0.7078875802607623	0.7481257082339245	0.7524962943085489	1.6957207213919108	2.242303309884872	2.746297235286925	
This movie was terrible. It is not something that people should have to pay to see. It looks like some Christian group made it to convert people. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to TV.<br /><br />It started out like an old fashioned B movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It quickly moves into pure religion territory.<br /><br />I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.<br /><br />AVOID IT!	-5.062819683937266	-2.2236098757662726	-2.167487706513601	-1.7965265494336724	-1.7791616132951378	-1.6476152285635783	-1.6391528298364464	-0.2658808242499113	-0.1677799284865303	-0.14198852730526904	-0.10863316349281218	-0.09271599848345968	0.03044442176473057	0.035064301023200815	0.06818644117248046	0.16094111290365898	0.6021839400581165	0.6500703065407655	0.8699266705283522	1.012679198697495	1.0682359235965686	1.1611641481461075	2.027440546823108	2.8195434992890434	5.5853589379697945	
Seriously crappy movie.<br /><br />First off, the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse/furniture store. The "bad" cop takes a girl, which they had pulled over, into the warehouse's attic, while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there. The "bad" cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the newbie cop doesn't think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a bullshit response, and then he thinks everything is OK (for now).<br /><br />The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene (made it slightly better). But eventually people start to catch on, which took awhile considering how f***ing obvious it was. One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies, like ya do. Now, the "bad" cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged body.<br /><br />Since she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her, she comes back with lots of eye-shadow on, which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie... also, the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become "eye-shadow monsters". Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (they look normal to him apparently). But when the girls see other people, such as the one girls husband, he freaks out because she is hideous (some people freak out, but others don't even notice).... massive plot hole.<br /><br />So, to wrap it up, the eye-shadow monsters kill the "bad" cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene.

as a fan of robocop, i always loved this movie. i seen it when it first came out, and finally i bought it on DVD from Brazil, it was never released in the us on DVD. i like the film, but like everything else in this world, everyone has their opinion, love it or hate it. no matter what a movie does, someone will always say "why didn't they do it another way?" in other words you cant please everyone. if you love robocop, you will love this film. to me, its so unique thats its not cheesy, or silly like a lot of lower budget movies. this film always kept me interested. i can see a few scenes that robocop borrowed from here, but tell me what movies don't do that? a lot of films use other ideas from other movies, and sometimes change them around. fun film!	-2.533971330491574	-1.9521077444828452	-1.663348404302263	-1.1504162591979967	-0.6928789305847713	-0.2411998499208627	-0.17695964710737924	-0.15008879657294805	0.019314179072214888	0.19746140100996626	0.2831203214275182	0.32337295726376064	0.43726580332480414	0.5717087286948738	0.6079639060820213	0.6446311342205986	0.8414365233679768	0.844355256245213	0.9231684260521082	0.9752621159859174	1.070588942349341	1.394911120654906	2.0202632707741532	2.8109939669225095	3.5073957351276572	
Acclaimed director Mervyn LeRoy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas. High drama is found in the loves and infidelities in New York's social set. Oh yes, don't forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder. The all star cast features: Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, James Mason, Ava Gardner, Cyd Charisse and Nancy Davis.	-0.9837468052474158	-0.7148623235580245	-0.5270683297767669	-0.5128398947432189	-0.33592510611260634	-0.2964687373405993	-0.2656909083141483	-0.11321322760425007	-0.06829545508879982	-0.045272706877608954	0.07526294806749571	0.08146542792940874	0.12796378741527203	0.1352309900080377	0.1852410492215589	0.18598943101853885	0.22714975358559034	0.26546095957547367	0.2665320731023014	0.32522555826024035	0.407559613203164	0.47158021077531564	0.7768691719801952	1.1337027655391199	1.6390748005393794	
Ho-hum. An inventor's(Horst Buchholz)deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly his son(Luke Perry)has been working on the antedote all along. Enter CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins. Also in the cast are:Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will be accepting. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at.	-2.6770341450037165	-1.3863069956649965	-1.1872026337909531	-0.7779695601313338	-0.7512589156888022	-0.7139026957769732	-0.32462043315276073	-0.2804291712764675	-0.2499367953474427	-0.23764632829996915	-0.2025110000151043	-0.12777444656832987	-0.03635303965825201	0.0011487459169576032	0.2121514093075826	0.348182153727729	0.4059781159921538	0.4354395293300138	0.4457226347714691	0.464980040236143	0.5302185593827101	0.5930686525589309	0.6699325964612345	1.2694163840742512	2.587619680026364	
This movie is retarded a cheap movie that tries to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them are smokers just a bunch of garbage Thomas Hayden church should not direct anymore especially this movie which is a waste of film. People who liked this movie gave good comments but from all the people on here some are just retarded and don't watch movies so they think that any bad movie is good the actors suck and the movie sucks balls.<br /><br />I think that many people are going to be upset because this movie tries to make itself look like the ultimate weed movie when it is just the worst movie about weed that I have ever seen I hope that people will stop the director from directing crap like this even weed cannot make this movie funny or entertaining .	-2.1357316528199894	-1.5218195509627945	-1.319603456202851	-1.295216427640238	-1.0275000790214732	-0.5018106177430091	-0.49764437950856955	-0.45584814074629865	-0.3699218232940378	-0.27590548303094764	-0.2571142137074452	-0.22007647788479245	-0.10054516731572952	-0.07742195903271372	0.0076026437724843405	0.013472316483305727	0.18090242541280638	0.20699762380880093	0.35404562339957013	0.3974399659083077	0.43229403025132546	0.6997106707757598	0.7406233540453762	1.2527189197047526	2.067873066638991	
'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest. Well written, well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters, highly informative, and very entertaining. The set designs and costumes capture the feel of the US during World War 2, and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at Los Alamos and caught up in the excitement of the Manhattan Project. The only downside is that this is a British production, and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing American accent. (The skill of current day Australian & Irish actors taking on non-native dialects is amazing.) The storyline is fully consistent with Richard Rhodes' definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb. Sadly, the mini-series was shown only a couple of times on PBS at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion.<br /><br />'Oppenheimer' compares favorably to the more recent 'Fat Man & Little Boy' feature film with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely General would be thoroughly flattered) and Dwight Schultz (alumnus of TV's 'A-Team') as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is around 4x as long as the Newman feature, but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage.	-1.775062468901667	-1.6017384342759422	-1.5226463892487372	-1.1341309057075155	-0.8590568888091368	-0.7957197719880631	-0.6599031827379034	-0.589272436540895	-0.3260048503100284	-0.18839661069616798	0.21841585072978836	0.25714569239628576	0.35504210659797303	0.4532026439575357	0.4546473937251471	0.5489031920664718	0.5848674780476657	0.6429512434078815	0.7554139298440307	0.7805440428477793	0.8342186233856347	1.1618022399619934	2.1816988109593076	2.351970845050721	3.478824861020197	
BEING Warner Brothers' second historical drama featuring Civil War and Battle of the Little Big Horn, General George Armstrong Custer, THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON (Warner Brothers, 1941) was the far more accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which really didn't set the bar very high.<br /><br />ALTHOUGH both pictures were starring vehicles for Errol Flynn, there was a change in the casting the part of General Custer. Whereas it was "Dutch", himself, Ronald Reagan portraying the flamboyant, egomaniacal Cavalryman in the earlier picture, with Mr. Flynn playing Virginian and later Confederate Hero General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took on the Custer part for THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON.<br /><br />ONCE again, the Warner Brothers' propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the "Warner's Repertory Company" are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity, and all is really happening right before our very own eyes. Major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon/Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), "Californy" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel), Callie (the Bacon's Maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /><br />THE rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited, though skilled players such as: Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe (All-American, himself), Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many, many more.<br /><br />THE film moves very quickly, particularly in the early goings; then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the Post Civil War years, the assignment of Custer as a Colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the Little Big Horn, in Montana. Under the guidance of Director, Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions; from the very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; looking as if they were Matthew Brady Civil War Photos. As with most any of Mr. Walsh's films, he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor; but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy (farce, actually).<br /><br />AS previously mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time we'll mention it, honest Schultz, Scout's Honor!). However, that is not to say that it wasn't without a few little bits of "Artistic and Literary License; as indeed, just about any Biopic will have. It would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay. Perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of Literary License is that business about Custer's being accidentally promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. It just didn't happen that way, yet the "gag" both helped the film to move along; while it underscored the whole light, carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film.<br /><br />DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary Civil War Hero that was very close to the real life man. And they did this on top of the recreation of an incident, being the Massacre by the Lakota Sioux, the Cheyenne and the Fukowi of Custer and his 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn. At the time of its occurrence, June 25, 1876, "Custer's Last Stand" was as big an incident and shock to the Americans' National Psyche as were the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the Atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic Fascists to New York's Twin Trade Towers and the United States' Armed Forces' Headquarters in the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia on September 11, 2002.<br /><br />JUST as so many films of that period of WORLD WAR II (and the years immediately before), there were so many incidents in it that were, if not intentionally done, were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another Global Conflict, such as we were in by the time of THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON was finishing up its original Theatrical release period.<br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!!	-9.371760102464409	-4.837907212826666	-4.817763721993296	-4.656534887199062	-4.300424229113949	-1.748816327436767	-1.4535440404216373	-1.4359728655939281	-0.9976057470775826	-0.6721033764870593	-0.4542396136428989	-0.4526510834040536	-0.29548387200235215	-0.063195510379396	0.42765422083959087	0.5833111648271598	1.018580622226344	1.0229206362619288	1.2849508939688339	1.3429148559937847	1.4740642411189915	2.133595753164866	2.409799811630986	5.672498117590286	10.320254585088303	
Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.	-3.9429134448080942	-2.9814223658469885	-2.923472459175788	-2.5516541756094013	-1.7852675282230839	-1.2792983914615128	-1.0794225987718549	-0.856293909674737	-0.41541121790487257	-0.16555403096864116	-0.061687913739005326	0.39235843351992045	0.4185000496372349	0.5151348594809328	0.6139194475590781	0.6676534849738397	0.8016537426817208	0.9115619600386743	0.9876905365293639	1.1082639765835351	1.1225598741309444	1.294246036180355	3.316618065357207	4.168302335245413	6.4618934954068195	
Lang does Hawks as well as Hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary Western, before settling down into typical deterministic, dark and guilt-haunted Lang for the finale.<br /><br />This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and being pursued, we know not why -- he stumbles on wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but discovering that Creighton is in a bad way, decides to fix him up first. This is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief, clipped dialog - in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw, but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization, then disappears.<br /><br />Cut to a few weeks or months later, with Creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from Omaha. He hires Shaw as a scout, who tries to leave when he finds out that Creighton is in charge; but Creighton wants him anyway, repaying a debt and sensing something quality. Also hired is a tenderfoot, son of a benefactor of the project, but atypically the Easterner Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco-busting sequence. Both of the hires vie for Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore) who - again not typically - seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man. The camaraderie between the three men, the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of Howard Hawks' "Red River" or "Only Angels Have Wings" than most Lang - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter, and doesn't alter our pleasure - if it does perhaps change our expectations - as the more usual Langian themes of the haunted past, dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier, destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film. Shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward; attacks mount on the crew, and Shaw has to wrestle with what, if anything, he is to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane), leader of the outlaws.<br /><br />Beautifully shot in early Technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations, this is for my money easily Lang's best western and one of his very best films, conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future. Scott is as good as I've seen him, showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog, and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. The inevitable showdown between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even for a longtime Lang devotee such as myself; and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. You can get a shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back.<br /><br />Genius.	-3.3525283796816416	-3.3100730732586237	-2.5915062711023005	-2.1489885067374423	-1.7549025925856934	-1.2268275844149852	-0.9406247789274628	-0.5368187678715901	-0.5131641388449548	-0.4948904351271685	-0.33097331683570846	-0.20966534412574972	-0.052485460898108405	0.057248424236605144	0.12605974324611802	0.16839280976690643	0.35181205789654635	1.0031029740813966	1.175332445883081	1.4972793590793503	1.812572289262298	2.7544688179611314	2.777080528119839	4.18440613903898	6.540086638947213	
First, the positives: an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film. Some of the shots could be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful.<br /><br />The negatives: the stories are hard to believe. Unreal, uni-dimensional characters preen and posture 100% of the time, as if they were in some kind of catwalk. This is neither the Antonioni of his earlier, much better movies nor the Wenders we've all come to know and appreciate. Malkovich is excess baggage in this movie.	-1.469268143397834	-1.0808779310631378	-1.0196489129435946	-0.8493827119815518	-0.6316160954991537	-0.5002975859185059	-0.40172565119976517	-0.050823139748563964	0.04132257476525975	0.06260080262762734	0.07283786263794191	0.08894107720590991	0.09123033500678687	0.10766304678495751	0.15187524071616898	0.16209458525611062	0.3418735994736547	0.35966902151049107	0.46047909856077424	0.46700520348247215	0.5176822045814996	0.8671835875208251	0.9304876449225227	1.2381503781472456	2.877113419273699	
Yes, Be My Love was Mario Lanza's skyrocket to fame and still is popular today. His voice was strong and steady, so powerful in fact that MGM decided to use him in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. Having read the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary Caruso to Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did a superb job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame it on Hollywood! I used to practise singing his songs years ago, and became pretty good myself until I lost my voice because of emphysema/asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!	-1.2564870736219609	-1.201027157413564	-0.8969765385029107	-0.891286984600651	-0.8189432168818811	-0.4460761004745155	-0.3877853837565937	-0.3211307806809617	-0.13353005820640185	-0.11610430488030872	0.04858437324642796	0.0910380860835169	0.132388746359485	0.2103189148370436	0.2670275729708477	0.40454894489333487	0.42932584768320736	0.4927070950372984	0.5027299279061671	0.5094922063979488	0.6611488129043831	0.6724606485377592	1.5626863727616487	1.6296140092449114	2.629888659191037	
What can I say about this film that won't give you any preconceived notions when you see it? Very little. The plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down. What follows after that is the movie. It is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years. Everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended. It is not a perfect film. The film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story, even more confused.(If you've read any number of other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere you'll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on) I'm not sure what I actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have. If you like horror, and don't mind not having everything clearly summed up I suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl.	-2.536586935087745	-2.276211256849505	-1.7117449322861622	-1.5262186093912884	-0.7882763462972654	-0.6412341727802581	-0.4622731257442105	-0.3548046865912312	-0.2660148724698638	-0.2397323810400712	-0.07489559870669697	-0.02474965621644401	0.004935013388254387	0.0413760036699463	0.060043408557295994	0.21501174769231213	0.22265717425410286	0.4377186011389296	0.5401583784144092	0.5416898613709904	0.6863607687508081	0.8949910513100647	1.7357512885733277	1.8996015149486538	3.006191482195437	
I've just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be. Toby Malone's performance really stood out, I found myself actually caring about what happens to Matt throughout the whole of the film, which itself is a lot of fun, very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters, quite an achievement considering it's short running time. There are plenty of good twists throughout as well, it will keep you guessing until the end. Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse. It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off, you could do a lot worse than checking this out, you won't regret it. Good Fun. 7/10	-2.0144292464097293	-1.3122594703828814	-1.1948914706314882	-0.8725459093700553	-0.6232131799895717	-0.6181272634901687	-0.4642755941567676	-0.3446608334233407	-0.08259722890278279	-0.049279896840209045	0.0997335378925092	0.10161499639809257	0.13294649903772288	0.26522822951049124	0.6002771834176025	0.6191211328222194	0.6556890183593784	0.8721496713236802	0.879555595778374	0.9673149916568522	1.162524256497956	1.5684215608762608	1.6723933053702709	1.721816757640327	1.919329624315494	
This P.of S. was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great<br /><br />(similar to mine) taste in films and have seen more than anyone I know.<br /><br />I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic,cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie,but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making.Or is it lowbrow highbrow?<br /><br />The ancient generation gap cliché "no redeeming social value" comes to mind. Bill Pullman is trying,maybe a little to hard,and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self-conscious and kinda lame.<br /><br />Save yourself from this and watch a double feature of "In Cold Blood" and "The Hitcher".<br /><br />As somebody said, this would never have been made if Jennifer Lynch was not the overrated David Lynch's daughter.	-3.395603359448437	-1.5950911167577706	-1.5289008542795652	-1.5194263936559382	-1.4362654596716569	-0.8075394241545337	-0.4350535936364484	-0.38675080213453017	-0.32018854194217905	-0.2893918115652725	-0.10859148227448734	-0.09412724219807184	-0.051678570382482095	-0.03815988299105294	0.1285874607652009	0.18698508374969675	0.22862723092328685	0.4235704467012459	0.5127892674493989	0.5170567032829059	0.5702314261881362	0.5839576063928109	0.9737555062742201	1.8331686355404506	3.532550424564465	
there is no suspense in this serial! When one episode ends the acting is so shoddy, the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode! This show is so boring that I can't see how it ever got made, let alone released on DVD! Obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary Batman films, but even the script is awful. An incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that, I am not quite sure, because it is too awful to follow. Watch the 60s version, or the 90's versions, or even Batman Begins, just anything over this version!	-5.329600398881501	-3.136321032253134	-2.935278791056785	-2.7331821762378605	-2.6156933813966083	-1.2286845053731172	-1.0248146128446505	-0.9011805132463316	-0.79433757121027	-0.5809871054798715	-0.5577769079056007	-0.4202045922183679	-0.3068233187266288	0.06237157128858743	0.06803996029110639	0.17779810033717208	0.3474636646493314	0.5171326327573164	0.7137119513408429	0.7661326819615426	0.8985962440350922	1.2518595379589526	2.331783528215271	3.1714822571535493	5.408011545249361	
Carole Lombard stars in this transition period film. This film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (First practical sound film was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). Overall, the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic.<br /><br />The viewer may easily note that the actors are still "acting" for a silent film, and this combined with the overly pronounced, overly earnest dialog (It seems most likely a diction-elocution-drama coach was employed extensively to teach the "silent" actors to speak lines), creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical.<br /><br />Carole Lombard's later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures, melodrama, and eager earnestness.<br /><br />Mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period, and for it's completely unintended comedy-camp value.	-1.4963494314314605	-1.0536233781774176	-0.8567442646146656	-0.7075300015120605	-0.5765842621172089	-0.2987383346699264	-0.17995447691368333	-0.15525113902121107	-0.109130938072279	-0.04471983548345319	0.020012390439015322	0.06243252541433268	0.06892267050242781	0.1479690284488635	0.1984715414294958	0.22843509759194586	0.24016063343880334	0.25107192018967783	0.3368796238049576	0.38474356312357655	0.5374552461668234	0.5941477522005523	0.6812648503962225	0.9976714760718941	2.091931481594378	
This one and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there's something lacking in this new series. Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned. It's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version. However, this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too. I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite. I remember I wasn't surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later remade into "The Lake House". I think it's because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film.	-3.4644163278436353	-2.2792482458136214	-1.9113112697145629	-1.5832488687114046	-1.235838654609251	-1.145783404316688	-1.0936564036540726	-0.5964477733150712	-0.0968021739246699	-0.0025379108242127787	0.02527519587682427	0.04353814532598177	0.061349728280506735	0.06314025036693294	0.11378314999608707	0.12628513896329072	0.14825713950678746	0.2590483324310223	0.5603705921320018	0.7540134950382167	0.8263496682039854	1.1051972051818963	1.1214935850348273	2.370617169566696	4.603835491284311	
Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is without a doubt ***** stars on first view, its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. This movie gets right to the point, you may be thinking what point? The point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore. This movie has some gore, more or less just torturing a women violently. There are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore. I'll tell you one thing though Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment makes Hostile look like Sesame Street. If you thought Hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain't seen the half of it until you've seen Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment.<br /><br />Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10<br /><br />Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)	-3.709709112462245	-1.959041056647006	-1.772865515089133	-1.431788028744134	-1.1315593153119905	-1.0723920839733245	-1.0595664878689628	-0.3027874702406509	-0.19137143566648646	-0.17561385068021215	-0.10269485547820936	-0.10050540790319887	-0.03831463414210595	0.20904695023378306	0.24698032316252458	0.2826084039319818	0.5040884125721922	0.5800002583702026	0.5922876231511313	0.877133591280911	1.0162841783754428	1.0824792340360154	1.103724900116412	2.3207052812567515	4.302665640804088	
This movie is #1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen, with "Lessons for an Assassin" on the #2 spot.<br /><br />The acting is lousy (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible!), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action in this one. Boring.<br /><br />The only reason I continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point, there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ...<br /><br />Thumbs down on this one.	-4.278988287826543	-2.234204309176885	-2.188839706179838	-2.1339154610115343	-2.1163073188488353	-1.0149338211687058	-0.9007320174547462	-0.6273291691051635	-0.5600304813458962	-0.543248641774234	-0.39243517100864156	-0.36388091381307425	-0.2634857535436722	-0.22802225109645585	-0.13878582824967048	0.18764557178181956	0.341931992016984	0.786727819619259	0.8827933010945552	0.9057514381470539	1.0323272951005973	1.2413979444883807	1.4014537545778993	2.7417058245521018	4.55262256197435	
I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and I don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto DVD, but this looked so interesting and scary! I was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me, possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about. Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.<br /><br />Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. But a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? I know... I know. Then they go into several other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with Isabelle? I'm not sure, then we get into a story with Isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him.<br /><br />I mean, the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. Not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film, which I didn't like at all because I couldn't take it seriously. Whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so I wouldn't really recommend this.<br /><br />2/10	-3.990473685722594	-2.65556552396918	-2.0641173786739535	-1.8651891881573164	-1.6046118621474315	-0.7976895636986809	-0.6763078329252814	-0.5803505534486404	-0.500808803858769	-0.4657057847258878	-0.2909623344360803	-0.2168084611837318	-0.1573354132404139	0.0019146556119644942	0.16410153014205664	0.1677474870160801	0.18968154346080712	0.19792170217973215	0.6382866329348559	0.9145266452942545	1.0097024026644221	1.473798210311131	1.4968115312026709	2.4861982396717544	4.7750701658109485	
Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as "Teachers". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is "Teachers". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched. What a pity that it isn't!	-3.133082441283671	-1.355984194758743	-1.0375672377132006	-0.9713197598126162	-0.9251481583506997	-0.7788886444315364	-0.6934881401513746	-0.5120960873184369	-0.42264074472912483	-0.2602474780354325	-0.1818064002650912	0.1261949282139439	0.24131263631200933	0.28310650899389345	0.3135810030835714	0.35817321636259586	0.3609828178143608	0.40511398041261554	0.5383147550745139	0.6144637681163969	0.8230063907513261	0.8399698056891642	0.8519975452479653	1.324002112362763	3.3973489994021246	
(A possible minor spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective, but silly film that did it's job and was actually pretty good. The sequel "The Lost World" had a few decent moments, but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a T-Rex running amok in San Diego. Now in "Jurassic Park III," what little story there was in the first one and the sequel, has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically non-stop action, which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done.<br /><br />Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, who is given a proposition by a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to come with them to an island to help them find their son, who's been lost for over 2 months. But of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them.<br /><br />This one was obviously intended as a thrill ride, with no real story whatsoever, but even on that level the movie doesn't deliver. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the "Jurassic" movies and squeeze the life right out of it.<br /><br /> The dinos look okay, though by now they're just standard fair and not very scary. The bottom line is it's not a very good film, even as a thrill ride. * out of 4 stars.	-4.066473788233682	-2.058218404245248	-1.9145341393139534	-1.729109524097807	-1.6288291854095196	-1.0859469463614844	-1.0354231577512336	-0.32376316060093085	-0.2700295520582695	-0.20752503589091004	-0.12280566597310523	-0.0874254899171837	-0.024478003933039436	0.1637114558073966	0.2138991120782426	0.3733765693737075	0.38070905674429945	0.42650443449749526	0.5584647776406555	0.7204984100669197	0.8364086282473601	0.9151306356666561	1.006436263629661	2.3709569029044038	4.876338781082166	
House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels. It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with marvelous performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong, strong cast of supporting players, and it introduces Ricky Jay, card sharp extraordinaire, prestidigitator and historian of magic. Its dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unrealness.<br /><br />On the face of it, House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men, diametrically different from The Sting, which was played merely for glamour and yuks. At this level it does succeed admirably.<br /><br />However, you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization. The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin. That thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus, hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after some easy laughs. House of Games sticks to its business. As Poe once said of a good short story, it drives relentlessly to its conclusion.<br /><br />There is another strain of movies-about-women, epitomized by Thelma and Louise, a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed, whether or not they realize their inner strengths. What tripe.<br /><br />As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater. It should be a natural for film festivals. Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.<br /><br />I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.	-4.049965922570548	-3.326329760798474	-3.037464051339521	-2.140142259175426	-1.4826467031362933	-1.331140767281978	-0.22409339336574507	-0.16555852201658094	-0.02024836578951042	7.873928831340915E-4	0.21768404944573727	0.3138143438551204	0.3179115844913905	0.3530956931805216	0.4330619864741856	0.6990537989558581	1.062626382296246	1.165006848798179	1.6381822505807138	1.658301376544707	1.8121302880800212	2.151897703721467	3.96506848038379	4.8457496334388726	5.34486850065507	
An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one that's strangely under-appreciated. The mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes. A horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse. Several horses get chopped up. It's very unexpected.<br /><br />The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the Red Lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple. The General has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood. <br /><br />The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many HK action scenes from the time. Sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film. <br /><br />Find this one, it's one of the best HK kung fu films from the early nineties. Just remember it's not child friendly.	-2.1207445632020385	-1.9597470787832192	-1.5266509765072012	-1.3979434067481962	-1.3407394981598393	-0.8188135811199391	-0.6196989713789695	-0.4175367793576088	-0.357291186624236	-0.2505356518326485	-0.06549956645697301	-0.04718323261509858	0.055747969831427095	0.06973227652407736	0.07938484194215835	0.13215427815817082	0.23565129088762532	0.24226441321948577	0.707877246486699	1.0026752760352766	1.17141921498828	1.5224271999879957	1.9973508370201523	2.0799888241705844	3.347530152136648	
I agree with Andy, this is a good movie. Kevin McKidd's character is believable throughout the film. We're forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him. Paula Sage who plays Roberta puts in a good performance too. It's thought-provoking and emotive without any slush over-production. Credit to director Alison Peebles and writer Andrea Gibb for that. A very worthwhile viewing. The pace of the film is just right, raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in, rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style. Nice little soundtrack to go with the film too, again used sparingly, not to distract you from storyline. Recommended.	-3.2279249221936492	-2.0021443680627735	-1.7519659290965581	-1.1358816212686702	-0.9749851957096243	-0.31347211296626926	-0.30509195162120323	-0.12379172542200392	-0.002696030915933109	0.20249246549975036	0.47629813858983416	0.4949508120568598	0.5095877489906402	0.5798702582763589	0.6312809753752094	0.6403796935216568	0.7300759566608978	0.8482515944948099	0.8743595195195425	1.0304726003071965	1.0782807146281397	1.2415677319596217	2.1387929079318977	2.6925744252954305	3.309177131787641	
This one's a doozy. Dating from 1949, Scene of the Crime often plays more like a Coen Bros. movie set in the 1940's and filmed in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche here isn't quite so well-tuned -- maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to Oscar-baiting schlock like Road to Perdition. Frankly, it's a wonder that this film isn't considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere, considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated mannerist thrills cloaked in false significance ( much like the grandaddy of all such "fake art" films, Citizen Kane, or anything by Murnau. ) <br /><br />MGM is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes, and I think any story, any atmosphere, even "gritty realism," can only benefit from grotesque overaestheticization. You could say I'm a disciple of the Minnelli school. But it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough-guy dialogue of the Dashiell Hammett stripe, a willingness, perhaps, to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like "Careful, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll have thirteen fish to fry and no little wormies to catch them with." I made most of that up -- "Mr. Wiggly," unfortunately, made the cut -- but believe me, the dialogue is just that loonily inflated and riddled with non sequiturs. Even the lead cop's wife played by Arlene Dahl speaks like she has a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the Christian name Rocco. By the time Van Johnson turns in his badge with the line, "I'm sick to death of death and homicide," you'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary devices -- in this case, zeugma -- could ever have been misconstrued as "street." <br /><br />For those who have outgrown The Naked Gun series, this is the funniest cops-n-robbers film going.	-4.674191982524194	-2.489256004513261	-2.455796748552137	-2.364415222039985	-2.0945001998477313	-1.4002539657742166	-1.3430465554188145	-0.5565628455783626	-0.45704221618897634	-0.44214738602740833	-0.32798371073351307	-0.2837769260778325	0.01063614173437391	0.07618192004798123	0.11278740178445618	0.2837038670884911	0.30625326268492536	0.32994323292502037	0.6033293792038363	0.8756773685260593	0.8832919535097554	0.9965464863180534	1.4894386931613237	2.960493715344854	5.416427661228165	
With these people faking so many shots, using old footage, and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors, what's to believe? Old film of countries is nice, but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films. I know, racism is OK in these old films, but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility. Portrayed as fliers, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was an ex-vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties, denying his wife's apparent depression, using her as a cute prop, all this makes these films unbearable. They were by no means the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them. He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer, but that's about it.	-2.9105274308841986	-1.449962785544727	-1.224778965687326	-1.1251675395623182	-1.0727355009423178	-0.8653788768479531	-0.6276826478836068	-0.5395459026123686	-0.5339368887926415	-0.33174333871472295	-0.2239039179654462	-0.1860860132522931	-0.10343287197946123	-0.052453276166260124	-0.03450387316288076	0.008176274830922786	0.02312124284678327	0.10531336523204632	0.18872230981582166	0.2699202363382967	0.6259388211897519	0.8643753160055065	1.195454791060834	1.283431083570671	2.940802933211121	
Cooley High is considered one of my best all time movies. It certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early, mid, and late 1960's. What ever happened to Brenda and Pooter? Some one need's to track those two down. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent wit. They both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted. I think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie. I certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. All of the cast of this movie was great. My opinion is of " Cooley High " is turn back the hands of time, those were the fun years.	-2.9821058441235255	-0.9551138146940403	-0.7587230499851687	-0.5816574578207647	-0.5142045840053888	-0.4805678544944364	-0.27636204371700623	-0.04987114018029248	0.08781046979933	0.11651560442642864	0.12416745928211059	0.19999537726523303	0.2288342927557967	0.23068528993550225	0.24101558839577736	0.24802988084125224	0.33615376155851684	0.41660118796409595	0.51903387032383	0.5878084542356379	0.6109743242328083	0.8087690761176578	1.1243368266655425	2.168887075551701	2.591232208036238	
I walked into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am not going to say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I have been satisfied with every item I purchased there before this one. On display in the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (Might I mention this is the only store I have seen it for sale in.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. I had great expectations for it. I couldn't believe what I seen when I viewed it. It didn't look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie. I mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know. This is no horror movie. You will not jump out of your seat watching this movie. I gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along. I swear I did. It never did get any better. There were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him. I didn't find that entertaining at all. I watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me. I guess that is how bad this economy has got. I have this to say to the cast and crew. Do not show this film as material to get other film jobs. Don't do it. I mean that sincerely. I commend you for trying. For people who have bought this. I say this. Don't sell your copy to someone. They could get very upset. Have a nice day everyone.	-11.255856552332641	-8.805596690269788	-4.628501139043854	-4.512083377629682	-3.6150459847608087	-1.9881392085380398	-1.976455963285546	-1.486150417580597	-0.4345440072307675	-0.250979087278802	-0.22755421548196855	-0.20014106343446234	0.19382299810770595	0.48443927933677866	0.8809722520516546	0.951870115725644	1.1296371404130037	1.4091170225968652	1.6867641039153909	1.9612482600306136	2.1761261217312478	3.985252163907867	4.392334364029523	5.700179076888144	13.872177618587516	
Now either you like Mr Carrey's humour or you don't. Me, Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.<br /><br />If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film. If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie.<br /><br />Carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot. God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey gets into the swing of having all of God's powers by making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston)'s breasts bigger, getting himself promoted, and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands.<br /><br />This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders.<br /><br />On the more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes. His most accomplished 'straight' role, the Man on the Moon, is less well known that his comedy romps - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey).	-4.573176064463381	-2.259726194837533	-1.7997484587055146	-1.7058763978518112	-1.440439448691193	-1.36797447904336	-0.9602621938869729	-0.5954139293429376	-0.5527868658444053	-0.49330813190425715	-0.4390847385539659	-0.17725618071806992	0.0034312311208544444	0.15330356828432673	0.2636272070382616	0.2693086208857361	0.556280270253939	0.5726542505751462	0.7934145456429069	0.798082081630898	0.9279010186790149	0.9393183195320568	0.9952615897881015	2.725153751204875	5.1530077569138975	
I was peeved that the best make-up academy award went to Dick Tracy, a horrible film with horrible make-up. The Nightbreed (based on the better titled "Cabal" novella) look terrific, the acting is excellent and David Chroneburg makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonist.<br /><br />The plot focus's on Aaron Boone, who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery. Is he making it up or are they real and calling to him? His Pyschologist (Chroneburg) convinces him he's a murderer, a slayer of families.<br /><br />Troubled and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian but the monsters don't want him at first. He is also tracked by his girlfriend, Lori who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous.<br /><br />But Decker isn't about to let Boone continue on. He raises the locals on an all out assault on Midian, like a holy war in gods name led by the devil.<br /><br />Barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male, but they are always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns the genre on it's head. The monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but man is hunting them.<br /><br />A 20+ minute longer cut was originally submitted by Barker, but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece. Barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release. Until then, this version will have to do.	-4.714880595779753	-2.8246519162887544	-2.1162057930281746	-1.9191834146095048	-1.720411866281386	-1.5000434675117718	-1.3036513061218447	-0.41000968315812414	-0.35961655432098	-0.1357133215092329	-0.0353027377722958	0.07666150121463178	0.16046167256305674	0.16660392685974573	0.18661191771197702	0.34903632724939504	0.3813286247635974	0.40233373310083537	0.7909642225721683	1.1413079086530322	1.2141799217189195	1.3215926215725933	2.4188106651984596	3.3194830816942535	6.457610413101159	
Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on. All that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family.<br /><br />This one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that I started feeling bad for poor Hank Worden who truly deserved much MUCH better. As much as I didn't like "Barracuda" (that's on the same DVD) I have to admit that this film makes that one look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Eye Candy: one pair of tits (they might belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads for various drive-in food; and Trailers for "Bonnie's Kids" (features nudity), "the Centerfold Girls", "Part-time Wife" (features nudity), "Psychic Killer", & "Eaten Alive".

This movie was really well written and was very entertaining.There was great acting in it too. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (like he always does)If you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list. There is a mixture of comedy, drama, and action. You can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points. I was very impressed by this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What happens is North America could be torn apart and Jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and i know you will too.	-6.143255665362357	-4.0896703851975875	-2.370721678187629	-1.8528696892954706	-1.7903291673040853	-1.235489267520009	-0.22042534706961125	-0.01009661572844996	0.17845615484359564	0.40423888657547846	0.4537289669012066	0.5575570122188787	0.6418696842450355	1.073469565653837	1.2712205576238957	1.4200622854831968	1.4268567672793626	1.4304309818551864	1.7046267519388978	1.9282734185233648	2.015614757062377	2.209927813848684	3.3256630063912196	3.6755791750283806	5.603581078647632	
Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they... somehow... managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended, you'll find that it's not half bad. The plot is engaging and interesting, and the pacing is fast, with this covering many situations, and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken. Where this really stands out is the acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It's also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film, and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent. The cinematography and editing are nice enough, but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff. This movie's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling. While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. It is, at times, a downright great courtroom drama. I recommend this to any fellow fan of such. 7/10	-4.637916581781107	-3.5461233894254973	-1.9635150607726575	-1.5912914086827858	-1.1840427030029472	-0.324933526298354	-0.29975806650071746	-0.22966949341953558	-0.02444283618762018	0.027156050713433234	0.3911347742767299	0.6432359137116991	0.7781606006150679	0.8540262678699737	1.0635838055420963	1.2807625997112078	1.5288615994213448	1.5322114440631518	1.617746323428338	1.773560329832103	2.062754806373738	2.3783321662593884	2.8947903698990873	2.9167772775137544	4.707722670690546	
I first heard about this film about 20 years ago when I was a kid in grade school(!), it just so happened that I was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entry for movies (or cinema, I don't remember), were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was a still for OffOn. It really intrigued me, since it stood out the most on the page (it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it).<br /><br />About 18 or so years later, the public library here where I live had available for checkout the whole 4-DVD set of "Treasures of American Film Archives" released by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I was reading the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs. After all these years, I could finally see the film! After viewing it, it slightly wasn't was I was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that that's a bad thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including hand-tinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes (filmed off of a video monitor), giving it a more distressed, lo-res look.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short/experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me as well...	-1.830677761156841	-1.827698267984931	-1.6924760051528946	-1.4058106734495623	-0.9117081002551031	-0.6150908248859532	-0.5936343017482983	-0.5880629463283342	-0.4890018975689327	-0.3482677846790309	-0.3330477561371768	-0.17080143770881162	0.10853687911711746	0.11579830984533762	0.21894213085792535	0.2953988012716612	0.29707578028820925	0.4048233175834263	0.6805630682219965	0.7113812519175807	0.7308419464042617	1.029404690300003	1.7260794057197941	2.2769912531538195	3.3673160766290327	
"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" appears to take place in a spotless netherworld, an era long gone by, where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket. It opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival, who pressures her into a car race. That's about it for the drag-racing--this B-flick is mostly concerned with rock 'n roll, man! The folks at American International were obviously fond of decent, square teens who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult chaperone. There are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we'd come out for some fresh air"...Dad: "Where did you think you'd find it, down her throat?"), but the ghost is a little late in arriving. Brief at 65 minutes, the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off-screen and a pre-"Scooby Doo"-styled unmasking which makes no sense. However, for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun. ** from ****	-3.2353577280949066	-1.6759689528817647	-1.0284440901074936	-0.8960174945742547	-0.8191688313753829	-0.7537271965380017	-0.6161547501319372	-0.5385944351113595	-0.5016627471378807	-0.15599424802994338	-0.06861379690377745	-0.035741913422205465	-0.030562850232847806	0.02435669407370821	0.31389336297006754	0.4276580371154138	0.4953995419895949	0.5397509592330515	0.5470414021880241	0.5915870066814551	0.5973619219106778	0.7122508662118597	0.8769271972588982	1.367687018792868	2.916509636865621	
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. He's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. Their affair, such as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but goes along with it anyway. Two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: Wood's Jane Fonda hairdo that is never mussed, no matter what, and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick. She sings it for four or five or six minutes, so you know it's classic padding between commercials. It also is one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman doing Wood's singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery. Also, keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses. By comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with close-cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits.	-2.5752241377628238	-2.0995559060940443	-2.0653384692945576	-1.5814090775226886	-1.5274374524531904	-1.5129264788239847	-1.261877321259349	-1.0378750779203747	-1.033411397998661	-0.2980103270398295	-0.15855995378806245	-0.0874925238737132	-0.024399078219285733	0.07607855927745516	0.10186363229168745	0.12155649464224197	0.450757986527659	0.5241362244850359	0.8628373302188791	1.2358913763336328	1.4256978327002963	1.4783104376510934	1.6049747053686179	2.9225327733402677	3.5134601871951676	
The movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers. But when a police officer is killed, one Tatsuhito gets involved... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get bloody quite fast.<br /><br />An earlier work of Miike's, Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his usual in the ol' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts, though it's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces. Rather, it's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction, as Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground, a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from Taiwan and keeps an almost-brothel of young boys (one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning). Tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with said society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm.<br /><br />What's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back into Japan, and alienated for it. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so killed his father and developed a crime wing in Japan. Wang also is a surprisingly Shakespearian character, which is weird enough as it is, much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with Tatsuhito comes to be. And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother. While it would be rude to state that Miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value, it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter, dis-impassioned characters.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB	-4.008306093500382	-2.564084640244009	-2.2070753676713295	-1.631899897370427	-1.59181663592832	-0.9616679380415238	-0.9436731301161072	-0.48561823156866213	-0.2584572412038178	-0.2044208175946113	-0.096735524259324	-0.0772173669120727	0.08983110578015449	0.11169468205008835	0.16163442591747942	0.33946491878484697	0.4052090515541277	0.6105638193595085	0.806242745431123	0.9168787314088969	1.152955073464135	1.2818156915767995	1.31398550482504	2.8085997937257465	5.057045452203517	
this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young, it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies... lovable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain, and a few great songs (and not the typical little mermaid/beauty and the beast type songs, but ones that are atually entertaining)! i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever! i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie, and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations! sorry not the most informative, i'm in kinda a rush... just please, trust me. all who go against this movie are killing their inner child!	-2.5128726061184667	-0.7336799069938723	-0.6668310811663765	-0.6511596180171177	-0.5428917699812421	-0.35865596034782177	-0.3189750634872147	-0.16082712426814486	-0.09179275409069187	-0.047361461789741224	-0.04334512596158697	0.3849119062321613	0.43121687715778056	0.4909446890675867	0.5126363933571049	0.7289716319249601	0.7751181448364024	1.0464126568667194	1.090303008653478	1.1025032236819263	1.1700255731436136	1.5451690342405486	1.576767136080071	1.5840478127776811	2.3276699763957875	
Trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable. It was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young. The performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.<br /><br />Observation. In film it isn't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile. "Small morality" storytelling is quaint (or coy) only in the eye of the beholder--thankfully. Story content--well told--can overcome it's time, subject or place.<br /><br />Ironically, there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era. Inserting "small morality" content--occasionally--might provide a dimension lacking.	-1.9879347912983996	-1.4959111658268607	-1.3859741981838956	-0.9975091482515772	-0.5447579371166454	-0.2536170356301094	-0.18584018444472086	-0.17190942320978303	0.11883290638995445	0.13687664806610614	0.22118571485117233	0.24184179531485195	0.3026854413408646	0.31124881439980456	0.35031232143515095	0.553467837517741	0.5635868731104849	0.5863174414262518	0.7275816954257431	0.7339994626114357	0.7875441318230995	0.9591956598052646	1.6277908013747229	2.1124293363475095	2.6257401439585384	
All i hear about is how poorly the animation is done. It may not be up to par with what everyone expects, but look at it this way. Would you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose. It was great to see her character transformation in this movie, considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get. I hope for a sequel very soon. If we want live action, i think we may be better off with Chastity or Purgatori. I don't think Lady Death would transfer well to film. But be that as it may, It is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are DEAD wrong.

I think cheaters needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i don't care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just spewing out propaganda and the host of Cheaters Joey Greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and unawares no it just will show disgusting he is also the wiretapping and following of people by "cheaters spy's" is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the Soviet union and Nazi Germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the 1950s-1980s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you infowarrior	-0.8401617947287696	-0.7075690290183694	-0.5965433033864495	-0.5564679259285296	-0.5339592748120693	-0.37725925777640723	-0.23355519130228633	-0.13146402645638158	-0.1231303169696034	-0.11200451488576757	-0.07421691592560536	-0.05962807989581482	0.0012335044993243016	0.005853277228908897	0.02477843205265517	0.06318227350012905	0.0683552910957841	0.11558960284572582	0.14395331900115016	0.16260084765876154	0.1778999574069205	0.25476277963379196	0.3333676086080682	0.5886426288223146	0.7681429524921718	
I love cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. But this movie absolutely stank, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? Give me a break.<br /><br />Don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series. It's awful and I don't even have a clue how it got any distribution. Rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everyone else the favor.	-2.699029074310507	-1.6794636095877087	-1.6314641213957235	-1.370995565444572	-0.9576246612005261	-0.9294657730227222	-0.5025260810775828	-0.4072289639527569	-0.33109121879489656	-0.3283982721491465	-0.16044705468922163	-0.15181411333093675	-0.09592746255320296	-0.04367807294438121	-0.021187020198545334	0.027674053019529597	0.21348842861933576	0.26797792061532366	0.33937158534056827	0.5323493115340512	0.8199137246106847	0.9260687386218057	1.3579086111573175	2.0351538485005918	3.015668779251252	
Delightful minor film, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama genres as nimbly as Lt Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) balances his devotion to his girl Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to the force as an ace detective.<br /><br />This hodge-podge may not appeal to all viewers today, but in its day, it had something to offer every member of the movie-going family, and the resolution to the rather tired feeling-versus-duty plot is original and refreshing, and well worth the wait. <br /><br />"The Amazing Mr. Williams" contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history, and its bright comic repartee sparkles. Ludicrously frocked, Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best lines: "I'd walk down Main Street in a Turkish towel before I'd let any woman control my life!" And the effervescent Joan Blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb: "Good grief! You look like my Aunt Nellie!' <br /><br />The crime-solving here is standard fare, although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life. <br /><br />From today's vantage point, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct, all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries. While much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, at times it is both subtle and penetrating, playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film, but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene.	-2.7946667025514205	-1.5866923875256531	-1.3695260096183124	-0.9009740258518408	-0.441206835879381	-0.41017184043762245	-0.21914587073237596	-0.19134157646919772	-0.1432822471296732	-0.12034138714438157	-0.032188046602466866	0.21090328323695354	0.22053750550440798	0.23913832414620667	0.46722714441874713	0.5069265420331521	0.6780489777540787	0.6909289927311195	0.8958635544639361	0.9368736849879344	1.3941752640501512	1.5714706848411486	1.5823425634655666	1.9434750277876403	2.469223200554451	
Number 1 was really great summer popcorn fun. It was the modern Jaws.<br /><br />Number 2 is best summed up by Jeff Goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that).<br /><br />Number 3 is the obituary notice...JP has achieved all it ever will. <br /><br />Once they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping dinos lie.<br /><br />That said. Movie is ok if you don't mind knowing you already have seen it before.<br /><br />	-1.6567962766306692	-1.2649014937467449	-0.8273479538153967	-0.4661427176784619	-0.4538613056773161	-0.34658161622566835	-0.334075696176939	-0.31511204292385997	-0.29821995749512187	-0.21019511119785786	-0.18708728490358506	-0.10293275309184412	-0.05390305621867431	0.07110288370992225	0.17971455345982157	0.2654786192018971	0.3781982520317835	0.39935225973278826	0.5137731438352944	0.5347181793139739	0.5544744841413952	0.743893620523142	1.0025483777057949	1.184609221025446	2.1557313374423273	
I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring African-Americans. It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious "wacky" comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay. It would seem that Redd Foxx's (RF) wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at "the store" back in Phoenix. He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.<br /><br />So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powder-blue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door. Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge. It was just to the point where I wrote "WHY won't he wake up?" when suddenly he does, and me and my friend's jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue-eyed, swirl-hairdoed Garson, Norman's white live-in lover, who just "had the most faaaaaabulous dream" Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A. He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch.<br /><br />Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit. Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls. <br /><br />So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico. While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him. With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation (but sounding more like we're about to hear a very special track by The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay.<br /><br />His first impulse is "I'll kill him. I'll kill him." Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as "maybe we toilet trained him too soon." His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man. Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought. He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! <br /><br />RF then hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazon prostitute (in this amazing fur thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.<br /><br />Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night. He commiserates over the loss of RF's wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because "she was molested at a luau." They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose. Once more, mouths were agape.<br /><br />So it seems that, wouldn't ya just know it, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together! You see, staid, traditional older black men just have to see the crappy, highly-effeminate entertainment of mega-queens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer! It's really JUST that simple! This still does not prevent RF from yelling "Rape!" when Garson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you'd think.<br /><br />There was so much that was just off. WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson 's relationship? They don't seem to have ANY rapport, and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexuality-and sitting right down on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.<br /><br />Other than that, it's kind of just what it seems like: a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another! And because of the whole naiveté of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years. I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays' female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with, and by extension convert, them.<br /><br />------ Hey, check out Cinema de Merde, my website on bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies thrown in).

I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a little bit skeptical. "Steamy"? In a movie from 1968?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong! Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black & white. The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. And the performances from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.<br /><br />I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.<br /><br />I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: Although it won't be all you expect, I don't think you'll be too, too disappointed.	-4.973750333209623	-4.250538261462159	-2.5534583509223725	-2.40786818619924	-2.205348679094928	-1.062082513176241	-0.8597894506435183	-0.32737152081616366	-0.19710716180556984	-0.07037702112175405	0.0787823288635589	0.40052854830129087	0.41399157354988075	0.45191617494730035	0.5174231842603184	0.5804268703573711	0.613273770991885	0.7810893091894103	0.8643301551798771	1.1915544814385117	1.2012595185876447	1.9800408393831488	3.3461500905287394	3.502873430564529	7.255619517823022	
This movie is soo bad that I've wasted way to much time already talking about it. Soo bad...really... ...BAD... and I'm not even that critical... ..I'm almost ashamed to admit to having seen it... Sandra's few minutes show you how far she's really made it... I mean really anything next to this is really Oscar worthy for her... I suppose the only way for her to look at it is there's no way but up after this one...I suppose she had to start somewhere... but really...soo bad... ...awful really... bad is too good a word for this s**t ....but I don't want to get mean now... but really how can u not after wasting 90 minutes... 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back... 90 minutes I could have spent doing something better...like sitting on my butt and staring into space..that would have been time better spent...

Uhhh ... so, did they even have writers for this? Maybe I'm picky, but I like a little dialog with my movies. And, as far as slasher films go, just a sliver of character development will suffice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Prey provides neitherand if you think I'm being hyperbolic, you'll just have to see it for yourself. Scene after scene, we just get actors standing around, looking forlorn and awkward, abandoned by any sense of a script. Outside of calling out each other's names when they get separated in the woods (natch), the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls; scintillating slasher fare, no?) and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesn't even have anything to do with the plot (wait, what IS the plot?) At other times, The Prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we can't exactly hear what they're saying. So we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring! Deliberately! Seriously, I've seen more dialog in a silent film. It's as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga in the heyday of the '80s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said, "Hey, I gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag. Let's somehow pad an entire feature around it." And ... well, they did. <br /><br />To be fair, The Prey probably had some sort of writer on board. I mean, somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies. However, I am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever. There are glaring pauses, boring tableaux, and zero sense of pacing throughout. The filmmakers don't have anything else in the "script" to film, so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced. These critters are all filmed in straightforward, noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography. If it feels like a science film, that's because it is. I'm pretty sure this is all nature show stock footageall that's missing is a stuffy narration from some National Geographic alderman.<br /><br />More exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor: a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute-and-a- half! A minute-and-a-half! That's a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with, let alone insert into the final cut of the film! Way to go, guys! Brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfest.<br /><br />Admittedly, the film picks up quite a bit of steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes, into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip-off of Béla Bartók's "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta" cuts in. Vaudeville great Jackie Coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby, bumbly park ranger (this was his last role, if you can believe it). And there are some nice gory moments, including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation. The make-up used for the killer (Carel Struycken, aka "Lurch" from the Addams Family movies) is also quite effective, and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Plus, if you love wacky, straight-outta-left-field endings, you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up. You'll do a spit take, I promise.<br /><br />Usually, I love films that are on this level of ineptitude, but the first three-quarters of The Prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest. Overall, this is a largely pallid and tedious affair, and, while it ain't all bad, it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists. Why do we do this to ourselves, anyway?	-14.117670898995346	-7.690865057173009	-6.483899697896726	-5.775348465515426	-5.221527383722781	-5.186067500332329	-3.951715263434567	-1.925402377066951	-1.4423388553413719	-0.6934363378926387	-0.5850008619150515	0.012974302661086928	0.25172745392203133	0.26533854835489934	1.0030305411274487	1.1830499217498935	1.1924500507648217	1.978053579971662	2.0101921570988046	2.0366172655983847	2.178599281409489	2.9126587969898403	4.307206017791837	8.139782355489844	15.528391736611505	
This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film. The actors are all perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a different world. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough. It may just change you forever once you have seen it.	-3.228969573230712	-2.0716084983412406	-1.4492737442027561	-1.434406649907491	-0.5700065862601433	-0.3415466412763334	-0.2997569612417935	-0.2374106559742688	-0.15560456871842854	0.1999478080499264	0.29002602914434733	0.3921707266310623	0.5284421435897702	0.7915621466526581	0.8792893199248255	0.9983982823582368	1.0559632916422244	1.1126796593191424	1.5106024014885622	1.5122409999703952	1.6072632271505225	1.7467461436741571	2.2203912835826958	2.318152575689319	3.2461612059802323	
This is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the West Indies and it stars Puddy from the "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here. Oliver Reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all. Warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film. If its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him. Then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff. No real political message like the film "Burn" but just another contrived plot device to move the story along. Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and all the rest of the cast came back! I hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad. The nudity keeps it watchable and Warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable.

It's amazing that from a good, though not wonderful, film made back in the early Nineties, a whole franchise can grow. 'Stargate; SG1' is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'Star Trek' as the kings of sci-fi.<br /><br />Following on from the 1994 feature film 'Stargate', this series sees Stargate command (a military/science organisation) figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore. SG1 is one such team, headed by military veteran Colonel Jack O'Neill, and includes archaeologist Doctor Daniel Jackson, military scientist Captain Samantha Carter and alien Teal'c, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people. Earth quickly makes an enemy of the Goa'uld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.<br /><br />The top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life. Richard Dean Anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic O'Neill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye. Michael Shanks, as Daniel, brings heart and an will of steel to the character, who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed. Amanda Tapping, as Carter, has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong, intelligent military scientist. Christopher Judge is excellent as the aloof Teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety. And Don S Davis is perfect as the esteemed General Hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness.<br /><br />Almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs (often shown through arguments between O'Neill and Jackson). Guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers. SG1 also excels in humour, from O'Neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd! SG1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death. It isn't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show, overall.	-5.781173743924205	-3.6413668479341994	-2.4670355786872373	-2.284534983592067	-2.2409899491616048	-0.39483087967669556	-0.3526339888671677	-0.2033331864287081	0.18243868939816213	0.5952741345503143	0.7498935516844506	0.7738506294538117	0.8310087938618057	0.8936207526909251	0.9236045603422522	1.2376108444897373	1.4777272435364115	1.5741501513967222	1.5844659227467337	2.312277404873253	2.317517840637829	2.3560811260388457	3.673001118378568	3.905766614573958	5.8280153404338355	
Wow, here it finally is; the action "movie" without action. In a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.<br /><br />There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly "Matrix" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.<br /><br />And, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.<br /><br />Believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get. In fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money.	-3.875616758148893	-1.9488785862538247	-1.7806167114898228	-1.7345107686523367	-1.721300142373245	-0.827014303710857	-0.5200336770327774	-0.42035556740422136	-0.41854285462888535	-0.3309054289361356	-0.3094539284960596	-0.26038560061225463	-0.2222667992853115	0.10655211894205444	0.1171247739885069	0.13091669196615469	0.3409356709796236	0.38608902510473136	0.4804294527591405	0.5032168841533261	0.9241019465871132	0.9331574628044426	1.117165008466567	2.115471610079954	4.282552241148964	
Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen. They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame I can't believe it. The performances are very hammy and over acted but I don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded. Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as "controversial" well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.	-3.03181761076004	-1.9465546906320994	-1.850085971336375	-1.6516327120825691	-1.356545830687496	-0.7088002886270361	-0.6682286376658427	-0.5937325349580527	-0.2842715756589203	-0.21334530443317395	-0.21093765689425953	-0.1860995968735032	-0.1157622281269032	-0.0387985604865969	0.02801618154241691	0.06573733714499547	0.10887374777295139	0.16090272023678784	0.24336726521308186	0.3091833938064347	0.8666353851889927	0.9196384689799092	0.9573752098915652	1.8577987381802177	3.227300285749325	
Rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room.<br /><br />Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey.<br /><br />I picked up Jack and Lep 4 because they are well known bad movies I have never seen.<br /><br />I picked this movie out because it matched the "How to find a bad movie" guide on badmovies.org, No real description, no pics of the movie on the back, and I had never heard of it, had to be a winner :)<br /><br />(SPOILERS, but this movie is so awful it doesn't matter :P)<br /><br />This is a TRUE bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are dumb on purpose, this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crew.<br /><br />This "movie" starts out much like Evil Dead, even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress. Unlike Evil Dead it never gains any speed at all. For a "slasher" movie it is pretty bland, in 80 minutes 6 people get killed, but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boring.<br /><br />The director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting, obviously to go along with the whole "Prey" theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring. The gore is horrible. All these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story.<br /><br />The last 5 minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion, yet another way to add length to this. The "climax" is such a total joke, its hard to laugh at it is so bad. The back of the box says "The ending will shock and haunt you." Yes it will, it will shock you that someone could put such a bad "plot twist" on film and "haunt" you because you won't believe you paid to watch this crap.<br /><br />Also the tagline is "Its not human, and it's got an axe!" One person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen.<br /><br />A true 1 out of 10. I LOVE laughing at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities. No bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick :P	-10.723815563815123	-5.745762589066464	-5.513414167938467	-5.3817085453518825	-5.248434345296558	-2.3849649083731004	-1.7532912814521355	-1.742041801600083	-1.2477245285767244	-1.1711217229593285	-1.0553448246613757	-1.0205462614834913	-0.4264305684702009	-0.3458454123260889	-0.1620533229958509	0.06811562650345322	0.6382125896737132	0.6989602555683059	1.8097848674819828	1.8138992995950738	2.4651803395480107	3.2017055778330303	3.225053216435938	6.061243322665581	10.858558932494306	
Radio will have you laughing, crying, feeling. This story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to view. There's enough for both. cuba Gooding Jr.portrays the title character to perfection. His performance is worthy of an academy award nomination.The compassion of the movie is obvious. The movie evokes many emotions.

If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about the $5 DVD bin that sits by the electronics department. Well, that is where I found this movie. However, I was tricked! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even listed her name as a "headliner". I picked it up thinking, "Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie?!?!" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie. Much to my surprise, Ms. Bullock had a small role.....very small role. She plays the girlfriend of the son of the CIA agent. Talk about supporting actress. She may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie. Besides being deceived of this being a Bullock flick, I looked past that and I continued to watch an "action-packed" film. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a gun was taped to the camera. You gotta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is.	-3.562829651241594	-1.946937237839637	-1.59090483220013	-1.2031172608727856	-1.068839634132123	-1.0505586458311766	-0.5270756234404161	-0.48125840472564674	-0.20190074518869355	-0.16932502262366522	-0.1374788394903873	-0.015822637656378844	0.04867649165134147	0.25398233173707824	0.4122375332836288	0.4327814561075097	0.4607944034067126	0.47099087785806903	0.6270623201033678	0.7822053881068437	0.80950530612504	1.3014734157095789	1.622424577508339	2.7682135141616664	3.0810324124396833	
I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie, really. Unhappily, I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it. Especially, when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think that this is one of those movies every movie-lover should have watched at least one time, so that was why I watched it. Don't get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres. Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'Bogey' and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another. I think "To Have and Have Not" is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s.	-5.2924440848517955	-2.0257049189438385	-1.9147976265033482	-1.892080218659685	-1.841626709467579	-1.6335897504707115	-1.2751933185968942	-0.45779054073684644	-0.39725638960681414	-0.3619127478844916	-0.1673910128574753	-0.024304250985966114	0.15938854859905993	0.16226169220300413	0.26367703272080656	0.3567177198613089	0.4318894212638944	0.4962139549378983	0.5895123298323798	0.5931712300128261	0.7004692948142041	0.759614425539254	2.023732910022226	2.7943747915167547	5.8081373195366615	
This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy, and the trilogy kicks of to a great start. The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically, and these themes are actually apparent in all his films, if you look close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders, struggling their way to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The kid brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses. The movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore pretty violent and tough. Miike has done worse, but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard. As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual in this one. The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a great drive and true grittiness. If you've only seen Miikes far-out movies (Ichi the killer, Fudoh etc.) this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side, as seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you'll NEVER forget (see it and figure out which ones for yourself).<br /><br />8/10	-2.665507084514896	-2.4025633184247237	-1.594984183445244	-1.1159403229686744	-0.5803686248035872	-0.2947077925855122	-0.0851969537684446	-0.04802813356452349	0.01134535385179647	0.02614921030051367	0.07155968173456395	0.18283565516210917	0.29296870264333685	0.45858692701874393	0.47190889235860034	0.4763369183786357	0.48877377062158345	0.5350592484724513	0.7784670686503953	0.8674049118640852	1.106122548504801	1.699237205963262	1.8924504196476006	2.372340009018062	3.0472450244778972	
I believe they were telling the truth the whole time..U cant trust anything in the wild... They family went through hell.Those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them. But still having to deal with the rumours. As well as dealing with the lose of their little sister. I cant believe this case went on for so long.seems like the jury couldn't see the truth, even if it bit them on the ass.I feel for this family, and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them, i would.I have no idea what they went through, i cant even imagine it. After watching this movie, i was in tears, and had to check on my little girl in bed...I think everyone should watch this.	-2.095648304936161	-1.4111277789794299	-0.7791426509870272	-0.7668632215638106	-0.4141409560999573	-0.3823992759353641	-0.3741088615075207	-0.2665032258286517	-0.24787357562731244	-0.19871116759066415	-0.15225703728123732	-0.05433021533629695	0.004877531935992704	0.018064249085666506	0.02478518971840702	0.09320381070716063	0.13560617726856136	0.1697544324904039	0.18352394449464082	0.22021300614855155	0.22202024669678297	0.3066374707522154	0.38688809145785275	0.9168988363928312	1.9862530382848134	
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Although I've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate (Hollywood never is) I still enjoyed it as I knew little of the real events anyway.<br /><br />I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor! His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic! It brought me close to tears as he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) rode to their deaths on little big horn.<br /><br />I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child. But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.<br /><br />I'll give this film 10 out of 10!!	-2.5294061710768254	-1.8627799429074554	-1.3956814109966544	-0.8251203944074238	-0.5771965725852378	-0.5340779623563259	-0.3949457299495697	-0.33477845664907174	-0.24889528685335374	-0.22552188578522336	-0.04851743056429743	0.158118882969995	0.21532799467370345	0.21841238393845291	0.28813667557566613	0.4625145579052123	0.8678243007735604	0.9516752999055845	0.9804218931530012	1.197710471011295	1.6286222229397536	1.8289598785696517	2.3614049987005155	2.6232674603439787	2.964334971843205	
I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and was also working at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston, during Allison. First the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a daytime population density similar to Wall Street!! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest Children's Hospital before it doubled in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is bigger than that of Memphis. Yet, the best pics Hollywood could muster are that of some dinky hospital in the middle of nowhere (besides the real pic of the hospital taken decades ago). Also, they combined several real-life characters and portrayed them all in one (super-nurse). I actually know the Medical Technologist(s) working in the blood bank. Two where actually working at the time but the movie shows only one pregnant MT. There was a pregnant MT, and another MT that took the precious patient antibody rolodex (research "alloantibodies" for more info). I will not mention their names (privacy). There was no nurse in the real life lab scene. Hollywood combined these two techs (most likely to save time and money). In the movie, military helicopters (true) had to transfer the our babies (NICU and PICU) to UTMB all the way to Galveston! Why you may ask, when we have the largest children's hospital just down the street? Because Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You read right, they REFUSED!!! Being employed by them, I was ashamed. Needless-to-say, I'm no longer affiliated with that facility. Any other comments would be repetitive to the ones already posted by the people that who actually live here, or lived through the experience.	-8.379770579908094	-3.257790794663811	-3.147517446274302	-3.0921006453151905	-2.608878160643278	-1.900372161428337	-1.5127145882448778	-0.9216998420657136	-0.8753920542268818	-0.7887502811693207	-0.527691230946569	-0.2664479598318607	0.5256568614471304	0.6956994036414468	0.8771477105856876	0.9259024878341514	1.0093322616066187	1.0213066004603248	1.0593101329076098	1.50856317976692	1.6656969517330928	1.8368917229039607	2.8300343024662302	4.063863910205939	8.633223510437087	
We open in a doctors room of some sort. A girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere.<br /><br />The story is about two girls who are taken home, after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before hand. They are greeted on their arrival by their trying-way-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-so-totally-evil Stepmother, who the girls obviously hold resentment for. As time goes on at home, the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. And, to top it all off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' recovery...<br /><br />This film is amazing. It has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming, it almost makes you cry at some points (I know I had a teary moment of two, specifically 'the cupboard scene'). But what I love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits. The soundtrack is faultless, the furnishings in the house, and the use of colour are fantastic. A pure joy for the eyes. This is a definite must-see for all Asian Movie Fanatics. Or ANY sort of movie fan! An easy 10/10.	-3.602758927031142	-2.365144954397681	-2.3399328647733477	-1.4048719646473726	-0.7699831412738908	-0.5660176405392346	-0.4838485249221276	-0.4346128125038721	-0.28248440947265907	-0.033895575366052755	-0.014891556393933206	0.04279036993245014	0.36749890810165575	0.5107009799643992	0.6397988350661015	0.6770342533072518	0.735912019779557	0.8062963433418406	0.8109809270426616	1.0392467383660107	1.3313348254845685	1.9433429873974566	2.825344881861736	3.793233065262903	4.138124833280335	
David Suchet is Agatha Christie's mustached detective Hercule Poirot in "After the Funeral," produced in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak with his own British accent knows what a shock it is, because his accent as Poirot is so perfect and organic to the character. Suchet is the Poirot of Agatha Christie's books, and although I confess a love for Peter Ustinov in the role, his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what Christie wrote.<br /><br />In this episode, Poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. Enroute on the train, the solicitor recounts the events after the death - a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered. When Poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, lots of secrets, another will and murder.<br /><br />The story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful, detailed depiction of the time period. All of the acting is superb, particularly from Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot here is without Hastings, his beautiful office, or Miss Lemon but he's effective nonetheless.<br /><br />I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in "Amadeus." Breathtaking. What an actor - when he's playing Poirot, all I see IS Poirot.	-2.29767753987311	-1.8819756204656393	-1.5821188707064349	-1.5632953345655631	-0.9764264676986739	-0.8170992347563433	-0.772527449668168	-0.4896982343993234	-0.4119786528408218	-0.17844870872508617	0.0039829387246305276	0.14983245882044868	0.2294484882708579	0.36715262560084533	0.5371667164801901	0.6056535528952368	0.6314722144284387	0.7263662879302064	0.9710155044647191	1.0609303218201367	1.0897644105072024	1.1079345573632309	2.2883177311472123	2.730087110264976	4.385411527676281	
This film is absolutely appalling and awful. It's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes Ed Wood's movies look like art. The acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything I have ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism as you would expect from an 80s Italian video nasty. No talent was used to make this film. And the female love interest has a huge bhind- Italian taste maybe. Even for 80s Italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but I guess it came out at a time when there weren't so many films available on video or viewers weren't really discerning. This piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. It's actually and insult to the most stupid audience. I just wonder how on earth an actor like Woody Strode ended up ia a turkey like this?	-6.891665111078993	-3.881185606686852	-3.876019399286495	-3.566232355785146	-3.3820007701054533	-2.3493925496395742	-1.7790752946078032	-1.0870771465698938	-0.8637968795502292	-0.840559767233786	-0.6573816465510571	-0.5296637213661043	-0.1290162047090755	0.4062492865231981	0.4130398716250979	0.46456233160578236	0.5051908360162081	0.8480250288786482	0.8704666144533211	1.0185510117218428	1.0512040607984203	1.6673641436847009	2.6197891702167424	4.506327633830274	7.54044815239104	
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on TV or I've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much of a mess.<br /><br />ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a first time director and it shows. The film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together. More like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together. The movie can be boiled down to this: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credits; cops going to work; crazy guy tells story; cop finds dead body; cop and chief and girlfriend at bar; chase scene; etc. The scenes just don't flow together. They're very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak, borderline amateurish. The scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene at the farm with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the Chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy. I almost stopped the film during those (awful) moments.<br /><br />The film-maker's lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film. The style, like the 1970s, is all over the map. The intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement. Then it tries to be a buddy film (Big John and Zipper) then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; etc. A film doesn't have to have one particular style in order to be successful but I'm afraid the style in ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it.<br /><br />The film is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateurish, the look of it is extremely (and deceptively) professional. The cinematography is stunning. Every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery. Or, because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. The beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves. And thanks to Robert Blake's acting (of a really badly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, even though nothing else makes much sense. What's remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it's been copied and duplicated a million times over. The intro credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was made 13 years later. Scenes of Johnny dressing up, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of American Gigolo. Strangely enough, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very contemporary feel to it, due to the stunning visuals, even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated.<br /><br />So, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on one hand, a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition. Very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall should take full credit. But, on the other hand, EGIB is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters, confusing story, and muddled direction, none of which are worth of remembering.	-9.885232466637646	-6.851687193227072	-6.518953606082888	-5.592035538579429	-4.9117941535355465	-4.027706812279388	-3.2883710986494554	-1.4173428622431	-0.7089273434318262	-0.5409500235361117	0.09897022303685146	0.4015303683949513	0.7419682091498967	0.847107552171249	1.0352521351126696	1.0862121124360051	1.4054709742937062	1.728851741711079	2.005880226828224	2.394731135597466	2.8165365127942406	3.218339087644619	4.586469518393135	8.6617445007407	15.449338750334086	
I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.<br /><br />Jim Larson's comments about it being a "sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths" were dead on. Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.<br /><br />Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.<br /><br />Natasha's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.<br /><br />God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.<br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too.	-1.4026052145410999	-1.221924941027566	-1.147089010295661	-0.9262787379999832	-0.6672294522068087	-0.6178654866471307	-0.5051988563735822	-0.4216587615067533	-0.2898873045583515	-0.1986251238827861	-0.04180420091636494	0.0504509905187317	0.08582770025900409	0.09313974593379898	0.1260812375767815	0.26675986066910573	0.38412816983314946	0.47120530151402507	0.47247806542322085	0.5655786350155921	0.6420835811048431	0.7084610907022817	1.1930786893553107	1.3646838645041743	2.4052232733125853	
The idea behind Dead Silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. There was so much going for this film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.<br /><br />The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were soooo stupid! They ran around flailing their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.<br /><br />I know this is a brief review, but I just don't see the need to invest much into this. It's a dumb movie.

I first saw this movie on IFC. Which is a great network by the way to see underground films. I watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn't hold water. But it really was a worth while watch. The main character is in such rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. His devotion to The Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. <br /><br />The atmosphere of the film is also great. At times, you feel like you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or disliking a loophole in the plot. There are NO loopholes (in my opinion). I have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies being made so poorly in America. I really enjoy the foreign settings because I feel it can take you on a trip, and sometimes understand a different culture. This movie did all those things to me and more. Please watch this movie and if you're new to foreign films, this is a great start.	-4.391670560147026	-2.3381896744591186	-2.1383124087634884	-2.126748512536188	-1.0086226659979516	-0.9757059487803387	-0.6360117133121015	-0.5547757453708395	-0.4492704514752469	-0.3077264859601016	0.05661294838716399	0.10470430153982059	0.1478445605727236	0.4201590790645469	0.5014618729190392	0.6107947884149825	0.7098184295018417	0.7173885943230345	1.0090744423595461	1.2092603240281858	1.2301318870647342	1.8453870008727105	3.4278410678348723	4.249972459710273	5.087146941562461	
The idea is not original... If you have seen such kind of story before, you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes... the script, the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious... If you haven't seen such story before, it is definitely a good experience, you will enjoy the twist at the end...don't forget to watch it again after you know the "truth", you will even more enjoy the plots... Even though I have a right guess at the very beginning, I still couldn't help stick on my seat till the end...<br /><br />Conclusion: A must see!! This one from Korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from Japan...forget Hollywood!<br /><br />Don't miss it!!	-1.0460500539503494	-0.7288219712971472	-0.5895521976088464	-0.5077051625908019	-0.3321846558640689	-0.2662875972783981	-0.22177940490395864	-0.2093533072166266	-0.20110579337361956	-0.14686579977533237	-0.12246261020978766	-0.0635709704260638	-0.009480736750920413	0.030915823684687066	0.09842671250016477	0.14501861077027683	0.20717105810987255	0.23332117421490028	0.25847301455802973	0.2648324823328009	0.3058409274559238	0.33321143691741156	0.4814145351444326	0.8981191716142432	1.3125710646836783	
My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old. I have never forgotten it. I had never before seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor. (She was twenty-two when she made Elephant Walk) Remember, I'm nine, so the feelings aren't sexual, I just couldn't see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her. She has begun to show her age, (She's almost seventy-four) but I still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived.<br /><br />I have seen the movie several times since, and it is a sappy melodrama. What saves it is, of course, Miss Taylor's beauty, magnificent scenery, the very impressive elephant stampede, and a well-made point on human arrogance in the face of nature.<br /><br />All in all, a well-spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.	-2.018188302426367	-1.618618038539993	-1.6032362780426332	-1.4153463225376255	-0.9303109013535791	-0.7237732219756706	-0.5349891724815101	-0.3366074153360022	-0.24813088419876528	-0.05600266091696636	-0.03280633399759593	0.02089993150647447	0.0530146884356072	0.07736187193688077	0.2578628191098037	0.27046498297490495	0.2744324373736702	0.29969272090615273	0.42543240903159674	0.7566393515431211	0.7640981082256887	0.9022601785123557	1.6660823347406617	2.4118384586596404	4.537240166580871	
As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I truly anticipated this film prior to it's release... I was not let down. "Nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. Rich in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror, yet showing us the other side of the coin. Here the "Monsters" are the hideously beautiful beings, while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence. We soon learn that we were wrong all along. By far my favorite performance by the often under-used Craig Sheffer, and the added bonus of David Cronenberg as "Decker" is a cast best seen then believed. The "Monsters" are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of English creature masters, whom many also brought the "Cenobites" to life in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" himself Doug Bradley. "Nightbreed" is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre, and anyone who needs just a little (Something) more out of their horror story. This IS Clive Barker at his finest.	-2.1023941911013315	-1.9832117036310328	-1.7952560127194401	-1.6563749833459596	-1.0216213949552568	-0.5983927158477487	-0.542712731875843	-0.3903590315662171	-0.35845984991313745	-0.051953085082849446	0.025798555305853416	0.07532879825863752	0.15868649504827487	0.2798611344023359	0.3291703197946203	0.4124759869323009	0.5731320490268668	0.8543865180784465	0.8762146850356882	1.0587069406125154	1.1060458070575643	1.4300456269879167	2.9189143399420203	3.1340607137622176	4.560800283748051	
Made it through the first half an hour and deserved a medal for getting that far. Lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time.

I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS 'big box' form and was very excited. I just LOVE finding old slasher films on VHS because the cover artwork is fantastic. Usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those films.<br /><br />To be fair, it started off OK, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods. The heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch. This film is basically a big fat cliché, and when the "campfire stories" section rolls in, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back-story of the killer. I actually thought this was quite an original idea. However, the back-story ends abruptly and shows us some stock-footage of a burning woodland (the lack of budget really starts to show now). After this, we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods. The killer himself isn't shown until the end, which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer. Sort of like Cropsy from The Burning, but better. As for gore, there isn't too much, although there's an OK face squishing moment at the end. <br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists - it really is a big mess.	-5.253923699827709	-2.8470233089470245	-2.7827620628747067	-2.744427966631927	-2.1711349116837315	-2.1496563225576812	-1.5641358269494194	-0.965405445217848	-0.5869037234503759	-0.5119884300158927	-0.41988274144328686	-0.23645084989403914	-0.09052485433264548	0.43289679074521914	0.48218074874771	0.6533885895276897	0.6967009343492979	0.7514406751382217	0.7698274052691486	1.026823892960589	1.0909348476327039	1.0933874364107625	1.7682228857410554	4.036715984064296	7.302896014089374	
I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars.<br /><br />Unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress, in this film it's Carly Pope, behaving like a ditz, don't bother.<br /><br />Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young college student, who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles, that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.<br /><br />There are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking Sara, a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto, a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop, and a woman named Emily Gray, who is back in prison.<br /><br />Sara's father is a lawyer who is handling Emily Gray's case. <br /><br />A few years back, Emily Gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy. Emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again, even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.<br /><br />The only explanation Emily has ever given for her crime is: I never sinned.<br /><br />It's all part of the design.<br /><br />Well, my friend, don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that, because you won't.	-5.425730260116925	-2.6848264088067526	-2.636879306915654	-2.5371524467237903	-2.417197126138552	-0.9124840459023593	-0.8727485492725686	-0.6964116516088266	-0.6058146646591771	-0.49245334207420227	-0.45391563386949957	-0.40244872021590106	-0.28278210012761396	0.021877665573230183	0.15283288817688684	0.3671535323931103	0.44530782092600746	0.47153891424344113	0.6101455569088103	0.8707404832594587	0.9431006664151801	0.943182231540156	1.6154925687915935	2.557117409429891	5.367763535184606	
I had a great time watching Femina Ridens a couple of mornings back, somewhat hungover. For most of the film its pretty much a two hander, showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and stunning Dagmar Lassander. I'd seen her before in a couple of Fulci films dying gruesome deaths, but here she is young hip and beautiful. The film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front, but entertaining throughout owing too its marvellous colourful kitsch feel. The set design, music, lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties Italian style, a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout. Both leads are pretty good, and it bears repeating that Dagmar Lassander is really, really fine. The music, by Stelvo Cipriani is gnarly too, perfectly suited to the images. Director Pierro Schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here, but its not perfect. Though very alluring, there's little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be. I guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but I can't help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze, more threat, that sorta thing, especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen. This is I suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity. Its more of a light, fun pop art affair, lovable but insubstantial, like bubble bath. Recommended mainly for those fond of the 60's, Dagmar Lassander, or sweet set designs.	-3.5214880193448646	-2.7958757368790073	-1.9832132765340753	-1.8446803582434372	-0.9082932649942331	-0.9007614345151455	-0.6163183843626284	-0.5619145357086397	-0.32671967997896434	-0.12763898484796773	0.12461979137358027	0.22699114462395717	0.3433678901295756	0.4008985966031578	0.46240902927377064	0.6702812435807725	0.8264827419529122	0.8796164847018237	1.2154554660356773	1.2450456572865836	2.0759479324262964	3.007883626507839	3.088493185407696	3.109282210059656	3.481457513477295	
John Wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time. His career stretched over forty years, and within that time he starred in films such as "Angel and the Badman", "The Green Berets", "Sands of Iwo Jima", "Rio Bravo", "North to Alaska", and "The Undefeated".<br /><br />The film's listed above are hailed as some of his best, unlike this 1934 effort "Randy Rides Alone", which has been pretty much forgotten about as time's gone on, which is unsurprising, as it's nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just 53 minutes.<br /><br />A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for reasons never really explained, arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed. While looking around, a posse arrives and finds Randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is. He is put in jail accused of the murders. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered, arrives at the jail to see Randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members ( She was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place ). Sally doesn't believe that Randy is a killer, and doesn't recognise him, so while the sheriff is out, she slips him the keys and Randy escapes. While running away from the sheriff and his posse, Randy conveniently stumbles into the gang's hideout in a cave who were responsible for the murders. Randy sets out to clear his name, and also to bring the gang to justice.<br /><br />"Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun film to watch, especially if you're a John Wayne fan. But at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore. The film is also extremely dated, as you would expect; we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super-fast motion, and the dialogue is terrible. The acting isn't great either, and Wayne's character is very wooden and he, along with the rest of the cast, look like wooden puppets who are being conducted by someone ( In this case it's by director Harry Fraser ). Harry Fraser is at the helm, and does a good enough job but the story is paper-thin. One can't help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as Randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone. An explanation on why Randy was there is giving later on, which turns out to be something like he is a P.I who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town. To be honest I didn't really pick it up, most of the time I was hoping for the movie to end.<br /><br />But that being said, I didn't find this film to be completely terrible. I enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times. But it really isn't a great film, and isn't really worth watching or tracking down.<br /><br />Overall, "Randy Rides Alone" is incredibly dated and is a tiresome Western with very few redeeming qualities. Can be fun but overall it isn't a great movie and is certainly one of Wayne's weaker outings.	-10.164133263457938	-5.877664607050886	-5.349431610323326	-5.302990280778226	-5.101461503550732	-3.377438058397813	-2.8548582469249064	-1.5302536790818504	-0.9418774733339125	-0.28103090864116587	-0.14555944023086348	-3.3005536686267836E-4	0.873996045713636	0.8895181347615311	0.9437001103304855	1.0631737677432724	1.1322030861643988	1.4502450958779372	1.4901109863592719	1.646454462685022	1.676818074763453	2.2859991094533436	2.758489216519846	7.448504554492906	13.357607441954602	
I imagine when Hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together, the talk is not of the Master's great films like "North By Northwest" or "Strangers On A Train", but a lesser-known effort like this one from 1931, obscure and seriously flawed, which showcases the great director in fledgling form.<br /><br />Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class London couple scrimping to stay ahead. He begrudges their lot; she accepts it. Change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle, saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury. They make plans for a world cruise. But their problems have only begun.<br /><br />Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill, or Marion Crane. Well, Marion's indisposed at the moment, but you get the idea. Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight, setting one up for a perilous journey at best. This is perhaps Hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme, and not his most successful or memorable. Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case domestic drama rather than suspense, but the two do not cohere, at least not here.<br /><br />The Hills are a dull, flat couple, with no chemistry or personality. When they find themselves at the Folies Bergère, in the form of cross-cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film, they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers. "The curtain's gone up too soon!" gasps Emily. "They aren't dressed."<br /><br />When the Hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise, it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing, even if the people they partner off with are drips, too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont) carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs, which he suggests be filled by Emily. Fred's girl "the Princess" (Betty Amann) has Clara Bow's eyes and Wallace Beery's five o'clock shadow. There's also an obnoxious fellow passenger, a dowdy spinster whom Hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue. Subtlety was still to come.<br /><br />Everything is shot in an abrupt manner, with confusing blocking and strained dialogue. Hitchcock tries for some early comedy with Fred and his umbrella that doesn't come off, and Kendall seems to aim for laughs while Berry plays for tears. When Fred and Emily break off, they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged-together rickshaws, one of many clunky attempts at symbolism.<br /><br />Emily's the only vaguely sympathetic character, in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with Gordon, but mostly because she's among the first of Hitchcock's many magnetic blondes, her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a Botticelli aboard the open deck of a Chinese junk near the film's conclusion.<br /><br />Matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set-piece for the protagonists to come to grips with, and presumably repair their relationship. Only they aren't active participants in the resolution, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing about the ending resonates.<br /><br />At least you get some enjoyable views of London in the early 1930s, and a chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food. "Rich And Strange" is Hitchcock paying his dues, and learning his trade, one for scholars but not casual film goers.	-9.70982267418397	-5.206091921324777	-4.719447029641316	-3.6622904595471675	-3.4062725815707813	-3.387477859938117	-2.1677591970165233	-0.836475268611546	-0.25665489727001667	-0.20929712367032002	-0.17045935082290808	-0.13014600638679433	-0.02003413805421712	0.20506111749219869	0.4341759058613598	1.2699292460147693	1.2991823039010215	1.496959544998512	1.8101711956982998	1.8682634862617973	2.136565022915734	2.248184970737539	2.4225960286541306	5.8659286895260845	11.839914544962705	
Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week, given 99.9% of the screens dedicated to screening it. OK, so I may exaggerate on the percentage, but you get my drift. Besides stuff from Hollywood, Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters, and from some of the trailers shown, I'm hyped to watch them too. Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008, but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas. When I watched Jodha Akbar, it was a full house, but it wasn't for Tashan.<br /><br />After watching it, I knew why. It was entertaining, but it was fundamentally weak. Just like it's literal English title, which means "Style", Tashan is all style, but little substance. Not that it doesn't have the usual star power, but scenes felt forced, and some bordered on a tad ridiculous, even for Bollywood standards I must say. Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2, both of which I enjoyed tremendously. <br /><br />In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan, while you can't fault his direction, you'd probably scratch your head over the plot, which was clunky at best. It tried to force too many things into the story, though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation, but that came a little too late, and only toward the finale, which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a Thai action movie, with Hong Kong's wirework and Hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil. And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink, you have an assortment of vehicles appearing, and the one that took the cake, in a Dhoom 2 homage, was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />At best, Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy, and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters. Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff, a call center executive who gives English tuition, only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material. His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh (Kareena Kapoor), who's not exactly who she seems, the meek and sweet natured hottie. She engages Jimmy's services for her boss, mobster Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor), who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it. And to complete the quartet, Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey, an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyaji's business.<br /><br />So begins a road trip of sorts, with friends who turned enemies, and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on. Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all, because he goes from zero to hero, executing moves that would shame Rambo, in absolutely no time, which is quite out of character. Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men, and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes, and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee. Every character has a backstory created, and I thought Akshay Kumar's Bachchan Pandey was probably the best, the most touching and the most fun of the lot, even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green Incredible Hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches. His wounds also heal automatically, which impressively puts Wolverine to shame. And the best part is his theme song, which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries.<br /><br />But sad to say, that's the only tune that is memorable, something that cheers "Bachchan- Pandey-Bachchan-Pandey". For most Bollywood movies I watch, I will usually be able to, despite the obvious language gaps, emerge from screenings humming a tune or two. I wasn't able to do that after Tashan, because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all. Usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location. That I enjoy, versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain, or atop jagged rocks on the beach front.<br /><br />Tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously, but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharya's story, you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous, and for continuity to be a little more careful as well. Billed as a blockbuster, now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one. Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show, Tashan could have been better on the whole.	-13.56256506854122	-7.6894558910053155	-7.103637343889527	-6.1057158660631785	-4.8395514035157685	-4.416465033123259	-3.727717551009613	-0.9626079696325466	-0.6722870563195278	-0.48060219407408267	-0.32116025494008593	-0.27160115894254516	-0.21669458046727347	0.2814161777318458	1.1276589835991104	1.1461382420036528	1.4887005993790754	1.6546213221268882	2.6869903708822696	2.9248839940772275	2.9463258965915697	2.9958693827115663	3.28819400417603	9.119949445154255	16.6221392094025	
This "film" is one of the most dreadful things I have ever seen.<br /><br />Please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction.<br /><br />Shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as "direction", which this film needed in droves. Not that the writing was all the wonderful, rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary "style" prized by those who don't know how to direct).<br /><br />This film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film-making (which is most of them).<br /><br />Just terrible. It says a lot about Sundance and what it's become that Victor Vargas was showcased there.	-3.9150212300775453	-1.812816053014521	-1.7806969528882908	-1.6763359261167619	-1.4558764295072877	-1.2081670509357094	-0.5679914087953145	-0.4563609020262108	-0.34355580157080245	-0.25770554064943885	-0.22270389395546722	-0.028709001978208998	0.09785293158186661	0.14495131410123238	0.15366719478427285	0.19345890714971434	0.2860934535322536	0.39805809331999376	0.4218246156601667	0.49924488384857874	0.6588056534096088	0.8415305262051747	1.469183434165766	2.0031237988569663	4.158852632434448	
Airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman Philip Stevens (James Stewart) who is flying them & a bunch of VIP's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum, also on board is Stevens daughter Julie (Kathleen Quinlan) & her son. The luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot Chambers (Robert Foxworth) & his two accomplice's Banker (Monte Markham) & Wilson (Michael Pataki) who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas, they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent Chambers almost hits an oil rig in the Ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. With air in short supply, water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor's as they await help with time fast running out...<br /><br />Also known under the slightly different tile Airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller Airport (1970) was directed by Jerry Jameson & while once again like it's predecessors I can't say Airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons. Out of the three Airport films I have seen so far I actually liked this one the best, just. It has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing (didn't he see the oil rig?) & sinking of the 747 (maybe the makers were trying to cross the original Airport with another popular disaster flick of the period The Poseidon Adventure (1972)) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside, either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's, dull dialogue, lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity. While the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there's not as much urgency as I thought there should have been. Even when the Navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there's just something lacking here. George Kennedy as the jinxed airline worker Joe Patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background.<br /><br />The home video & theatrical version of Airport '77 run 108 minutes while the US TV versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence, many more scenes with George Kennedy as Patroni, flashbacks to flesh out character's, longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator. While I would like to see this extra footage I am not sure I could sit through a near three hour cut of Airport '77. As expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices, I will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either. Along with the other two Airport sequels this takes pride of place in the Razzie Award's Hall of Shame although I can think of lots of worse films than this so I reckon that's a little harsh. The action scenes are a little dull unfortunately, the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as I reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly.<br /><br />The production values are alright if nothing spectacular. The acting isn't great, two time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this, one time Oscar winner James Stewart looks old & frail, also one time Oscar winner Lee Grant looks drunk while Sir Christopher Lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too.<br /><br />Airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three Airport films so far & I liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly, the production & bland direction doesn't help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldn't be this boring or lethargic. Followed by The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979).	-10.423696495222654	-6.1992820067263965	-6.079910492834882	-5.650926968323835	-5.29290474831257	-2.4433210952628057	-2.1524695773853613	-2.1503551161140337	-1.2578670963767808	-0.8192966870175143	-0.7454906036606049	0.08264278188107121	0.15025222013047668	0.1603837770205142	0.34782518697095094	0.41249906526424573	0.7334304901308172	1.0491544953694516	1.396174800505068	1.4830729238085472	1.8339870468059298	2.011822131791897	2.833053957242673	6.687162903500083	11.80040880070753	
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. I love shark movies and this one just disappoints. I've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work. I'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.	-3.6022734933888496	-2.900018310135392	-2.8028449015887675	-2.4733015025339857	-2.425217963056539	-1.3365524839483593	-1.232119632817014	-0.5786535899840499	-0.3968100882244497	-0.38488177840846816	-0.3233546853273733	-0.2915056854625207	-0.2567655272187411	-0.18869161325991557	-0.0950430944334843	-0.08797628728705487	0.13154905418326623	0.14841670396259132	0.5869161348259321	0.8580268849545665	1.0525606341844642	1.2184232856444255	2.119140615540642	3.1227802178718	4.3434447235780524	
A fantastic Arabian adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu of Black Narcissus) search for Ahmad's love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There's hardly a down moment here. It's always inventing new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring (there's no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle. I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. This probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together. And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider. 8/10.	-3.5963416101311876	-3.1779841413227548	-3.0576071554903668	-2.5757533779850794	-1.6163535332500596	-1.2839771306309427	-0.7773577522677149	-0.5712729163531483	-0.49982029267705436	-0.183797705562068	-0.16827304752186903	-0.1332915376016793	0.3194616419297687	0.37319870715321685	0.6509804365235317	0.819899032906704	1.1312885211303016	1.2916140880722708	1.4775697587033105	1.5881207062848153	1.7428427332170766	1.7590370797595625	3.943497206356751	4.3974389199697175	4.844290529457388	
On Sunday July 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called "Stargate SG-1" was broadcast on Showtime. A spin-off of and sequel to the 1994 film "Stargate" starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film. For ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG-1. Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neill (two "l"s!), Michael Shanks as Dr. Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter, Christopher Judge as Teal'c and Don S. Davis as Major General George S. Hammond. For ten long years, we watched the team battle against the Goa'uld, the Replicators, the Ori and many other aggressors. At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tok'ra, the rebel Jaffa, the Nox and the Tollan. They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them. And sometimes not even then.<br /><br />As with all long-running series, they were numerous cast changes. Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor. Daniel Jackson's successor as the team's resident archaeologist/geek was Jonas Quinn, an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara, played by Corin Nemec. However, Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time. Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards. Don S. Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go. The show's original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons. His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons. He finally left "SG-1" in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six-year-old daughter. Jack O'Neill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.<br /><br />The ninth season represented a new era for the programme. With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goa'uld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high. Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goa'uld as the series' main adversaries. Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re-invention. Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1. His "Farscape" co-star, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goa'uld host and con artist from another planet. A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season. Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack O'Neill and General Hammond. For the last two years, they starred alongside the "SG-1" faithful (Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge) and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.<br /><br />Alas, all good things must come to an end. During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August 2006. After ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over. On March 13, 2007, what began with "Children of the Gods" ended with "Unending". The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States on June 22, 2007.<br /><br />In the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, "Star Trek", in terms of popularity in certain countries. It became the second-longest running sci-fi series in the world, second only to "Doctor Who" (1963-1989), and the longest-running American produced sci-fi series, having surpassed "The X-Files" only a few months before it ended.<br /><br />"Stargate SG-1" represents the cornerstone of the "Stargate" franchise. In 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spin-off series entitled "Stargate Atlantis", which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008. Although plans for another feature film fell through, two direct-to-DVD films, "Stargate: The Ark of Truth" and "Stargate Continuum", were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future. A third live-action series, "Stargate Universe", is also due to premiere at some point next year. (There was, unfortunately, an animated series, "Stargate Infinity", which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better). Despite the end of "SG-1" and "Atlantis" as continuing series, the future of "Stargate" looks very bright indeed.<br /><br />In conclusion, while "Stargate" has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci-fi television franchises such as "Star Trek" and "Doctor Who", its still relatively new compared to those two sci-fi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.	-16.05187447863122	-7.961926076983949	-6.146688825513017	-5.5174173428565405	-5.439795845272417	-4.040403511960238	-3.2301284186177375	-2.601558233992046	-1.7082694673785142	-1.3880653060708708	-1.015184676103037	0.2305043177196479	0.3604755235428709	1.4542784865876413	1.5480027149729327	1.5900697243289095	1.9524686959049509	2.0328385778829987	2.9839435401163596	3.3495643649664135	3.8024002644518875	4.227918312151668	4.33297105542355	8.319920616442737	19.108738794481113	
If this film had been made in the 50's or 60's, critics and fans alike would have praised it. I myself, enjoyed the film from beginning to end. It's not a timeless piece, and has not aged well over the years, but it is enjoyable to watch, nonetheless. As for Mrs. Ritchie's acting in the film? Not the best on the planet -- but it adds to the film's unique slapstick comedy-aspirations, and showcases Madonna's (often underrated) sense of comedic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-convict who was framed for a crime she didn't commit. Griffin Dunne plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot. (And there *is* one, folks!) Give the film a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is.	-1.9517180952849862	-1.4642327636616979	-1.202531852567514	-1.0855771818541875	-0.9519864166974247	-0.3322892391990312	-0.31700812825047203	-0.24880667761633948	-0.24872598111251376	-0.19696259882025574	-0.13024232320241894	-0.013487147052762008	-0.0028913722588679944	0.05563914216183648	0.06735162496508998	0.23781312750016065	0.35989299782477047	0.38874492372972447	0.4201092205437552	0.538410381407153	0.8538677191652324	1.1387127388264549	1.771589309304648	2.0304369209095547	2.9233143140244415	
Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to view all of his work. He has been known to single-handedly save movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This movie suffers from a low budget and it's production values are disturbing.

Don't worry when looking at the cover of the DVD, Sandra Bullock only appears at most 5 minutes in total in this cult classic. The entertainment value here is very high. <br /><br />To name but a few of the many highlights that should be paid attention to:<br /><br />- The doubled evil voices of the chief bad guys - The special gun cam - The weird masks and outfits of the hit killers - The showy ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground - The abundance of bottom-up shots - The spacey scene in which Bullock falls unconscious on the street - The over-cliché Italian mob guy Moe (LaMotta) - The cheap synthesizer background music - The mesmerizing overdone gun fetishism<br /><br />And last but not least: the super corny fist-fight scenes. Wish there would have been more of those...<br /><br />Extra point for the successful attempt at making me laugh out loud.	-1.216129380453564	-0.9611766637981092	-0.953793153627341	-0.8315016414284058	-0.7939311264332036	-0.7628777998319115	-0.5163613520571367	-0.17104086377491987	-0.11006071993855035	-0.04576941354275045	-0.02659282119616229	0.035020637719828364	0.04359557659536176	0.09455943476882596	0.09508918695267483	0.1222156324218326	0.17350049780032317	0.20165579687844265	0.2535003132010114	0.2761087928643664	0.4683950227316168	0.4851282599100065	0.5361648443417179	1.2783507189681715	2.253384945803013	
(this may be a bit on the spoilerish side) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie, nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed. That of course is the problem with taking, what many believe to be an amazing book, and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie.<br /><br />A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago. It's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults. Plus it's got built in quality sequels. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book. It is a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic", because that was the easiest way of explaining it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W's as added tension, there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses... that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book.<br /><br />I could nitpick for days about little things, but I also think larger things, like the art direction was a off. Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look, with its strangely darkened skies. The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like earth. It has people on it that look like humans. The skies are blue, the grass is green, and there are children playing. But something is a little bit off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth, that is if we forget how to love. It would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm.<br /><br />I unfortunately did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well.<br /><br />Overall an artistic disappointment.<br /><br />	-8.259141320582382	-4.945124275873075	-4.430986858423484	-3.7746226684190427	-2.886637370343318	-2.674419093027117	-2.375702830519841	-1.0881862881557047	-0.6021836831032628	-0.36298674300469025	-0.152819813301866	-0.025432282471963705	0.1473859030357768	0.1947385932753829	0.5747504639230914	0.8418955477555499	0.998260113821834	1.4000386448446	1.4967538625504158	1.6638325442427018	1.7339216928245678	2.21106887749296	3.5415067211710927	5.610270497388705	10.2542779550453	
I know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. The entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. This is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. However, unless you really love this sort of art or are a Canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish. I have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even I had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes. I can respect the work that went into it, but it's just not compelling.	-1.395485688850151	-1.3340374332302651	-1.0405067893442748	-0.8360236547271409	-0.5721377476159696	-0.4494473871281832	-0.38979552257648786	-0.34576856389746163	-0.2687779003485956	-0.26095454152903763	-0.20180324344853107	-0.11456601199251122	-0.09609928028673673	-7.03132191320982E-4	0.08517934974140937	0.15981515332675192	0.17506301216297704	0.20515259086246548	0.4464189127211265	0.46636495284843194	0.7446503007800942	0.8379779823196347	1.3977730567967803	1.721024649250408	2.6148965782156197	
Somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a hapless, fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding U.S. Treasury Agent (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thief/hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead.<br /><br />"Bait" marks the sophomore feature for Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie. What the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are flat-out excellent.<br /><br />Foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning, but throughout the film, I began to catch on. Hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in "Marathon Man". Morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost.	-2.083534466980003	-0.9199435913919801	-0.7562336144571504	-0.6701759391933415	-0.5586915579890508	-0.2986894777954631	-0.009770407556128659	0.025118563141442785	0.08014118820088317	0.08152335633915656	0.1210440560778377	0.13874124076130037	0.2571970989197634	0.25980717827760286	0.48007640044552297	0.4988326464650866	0.5848152694820113	0.6804799707398094	0.7171866966859392	0.7426615524580232	0.7612837323576731	0.7624099719469204	1.3876915869225595	1.4072323258110684	1.6971622780154572	
Even worse then the incredibly boring "the Exorcism of Emily Rose". It started off decently, and right up until the mom said to the dad, "See I knew she was possessed", in an I told you so voice. It was a terrible line, spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie. Every family member has an issue from the past with the priest. The dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife, or actually having an affair with her, culminating with him killing his buddy, then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn't slept with his wife after all. People are dying, others are coming under possession, and by this point most viewers don't even care anymore. Except for their employee Miguel, none of the characters in this movie was actually likable, making it hard to care, about any of them. The acting was terrible and the writing even worse. Glad I saw it for free; although I feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time I lost.	-4.70953826827464	-2.7232071117670977	-2.649206911632079	-2.576013010384801	-2.4720448347928525	-1.2499194413328356	-0.84586886390495	-0.8382486278060116	-0.7320870478061511	-0.6545082209784729	-0.6102747174252242	-0.5718639006762358	-0.08659941738588893	-0.05651902334919455	-0.0034084158320733526	0.22141832899004457	0.2864685520006855	0.4670665047560053	0.8674139383076285	1.0563026007468008	1.1058431392771075	1.2345353004664033	1.3902266709838718	3.1607778009433463	5.1840819173260915	
The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I've yet run across. You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie. Acting  Bad. Editing  Bad. Direction  Bad. Special Effects  Bad and Laughable. Plot  Bad. Lighting  Bad. Cinematography  Bad. Costume Design  Bad and Silly. Everything Else  Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test. This is one for either masochists or Lou Ferrigno completists (if any exist).<br /><br />Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules: <br /><br />1. If you don't have the budget for real special effects, rotoscope a scene from the previous movie. It will look great - trust me.<br /><br />2. When on a quest to recover Zeus' thunderbolts, take time for frequent stops to oil-up you body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions.<br /><br />3. Any sword fight, use of magic, and just about all other day to day activities in ancient Greece created a sound very similar to a game of Pac Man or Asteroids.<br /><br />4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed like extras from Star Wars.<br /><br />5. If you need to pad your crappy movie's runtime, extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music. It also helps if you've got a previous movie to pull scenes from.<br /><br />6. Fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack Hercules one at a time.<br /><br />7. William Berger did anything for money.<br /><br />8. I didn't think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film, Hercules (1983), look like an Academy Award winner.	-9.233844598273526	-5.909652373625605	-3.372312447933681	-3.354366779063573	-2.588690044827744	-2.1250101564723565	-1.8710962154807893	-1.8634492459443412	-1.4747481175254646	-1.443972118014618	-1.3057714291768576	-1.062155434687685	-0.12722131421056582	-0.028914978242096948	-7.42692786812868E-4	0.14273479820974466	0.2593809164348359	1.0072815198159146	1.109780528319708	1.8826652058036308	2.4221410665528476	2.4580279727420167	3.9481527564963796	5.0507390928223534	9.174346035451205	
I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. It's a movie to watch with your family by far.<br /><br />My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disastor, nudity/sexuality and some language.	-2.4841651923195722	-1.743152089482925	-0.9077758791038286	-0.8835482347812413	-0.35515607442084984	-0.3131788007788299	-0.1043188725187268	0.03338921568953133	0.09771767222574476	0.14748471784619108	0.27093080710291945	0.4387360612234117	0.5326354382142553	0.5558041725670032	0.6032341184502956	0.6244889482559439	0.6336807071387404	0.642238938314995	0.7215065673858295	0.8315290762829615	1.102213160859282	1.3429271756908203	1.5393152228248819	1.6204610744105046	2.273142241912227	
Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted Food Critic whose flamboyant, overbearing mother moves in with her. JJ, aghast at this turn of events, then blackmails restaurant owner, Alex, to entertain her mother in exchange for "maybe" reviewing his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother. There are numerous problems with this movie, the characters are universally 2-dimensional. JJ is a self-serving, hateful character, her mother superficial and shallow. JJ's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. The underlying message of an over-50 woman unable to make it on her own, without male assistance is bad, bad, BAD. The acting is uniformly dull, the script uninspired. The films only saving grace is the setting of New York City. I would so NOT recommend this film.	-5.664309685059472	-3.3925232098615217	-3.2092635622990686	-3.1143351544611986	-2.8245172536755114	-0.9321350656094153	-0.8701031293682959	-0.7601043982517135	-0.4964304152566382	-0.3800710177351244	-0.3731144085194156	-0.28226127287688063	-0.2247424678872187	0.04437060754595665	0.2182322451448962	0.32008154922428733	0.38021720265012604	0.41407787974877175	0.7570270407122333	0.8628188412089235	1.0560060829090232	1.2352271246337159	1.4821165600600332	3.4047937067833542	5.789318729229014	
Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. Cash's narration is good too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd love to buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA	-2.106896972221051	-1.9575977424699835	-1.327644821219485	-1.252659279375948	-0.7150778717789829	-0.6714020865165518	-0.4472299418670943	-0.4138548517535662	-0.302391999807212	-0.27319877160411876	-0.19810739361490212	-0.11083174266526458	-0.08322670408540749	-0.0376722694666326	0.09133954661708331	0.15433278823148713	0.23990672209584474	0.599705379935513	0.6373955390886323	0.6674566283166864	0.7805806494894529	0.8612919328474654	1.2138912444460688	1.3002356014862044	2.053191911964899	
Some ugly weirdo who had three families, cheated on and neglected all of them, built ugly useless buildings all over which are now unappreciated and crumbling. His bastard half-Jew son runs around interviewing random Jewish senile people who we care nothing about and shows his dreadful narrating and writing skills while tragic piano music plays. This goes on for almost two boring hours and amounts to nothing.<br /><br />All you shallow hippie people who watch these stupid documentaries, eating salads and yogurt, think all this crap is so important.

Now I'll be the first to admit it when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much I disliked this movie.<br /><br />That about sums it up too. I disliked this movie. To be more specific, I disliked the concept of this movie. The cinematography was good. The mood was nice. And the acting was satisfactory.<br /><br /> However, the story is fatuous, unacurate and misleading. It is also offensive.<br /><br />I am a quarter Cree Indian, and for some reason I feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he's a black guy. And this isn't a racist remark, I swear. The thought of a White, Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a Samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai. For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway? It must be one of those replicas, which insults the Samurai caste even more.<br /><br />Also, Ghost Dog showed no honor. Near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain. Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninjas way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but hates none-the-less.<br /><br />Then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie. You know what a true Samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable? He kills himself, to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.<br /><br />Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to: Bushido.<br /><br />So, we have great cinematography, good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise, (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it) , making it an unsatisfactory overall film, and an insult to everything a honorable bushi(samurai) holds dear.<br /><br /> 2.5/10 Bleah	-9.014391986990569	-5.112969579605726	-3.9877495525095794	-3.1162050830607178	-2.9089660617472934	-2.905886979513472	-2.4022885580947926	-1.7586626783930548	-1.0026918829470328	-0.6541193935289537	-0.32824951714724426	-0.31434893297804894	-8.235874647026104E-4	0.08972192939071934	0.6165461129676091	1.3893840056863629	1.4007003526644433	1.5162483162594087	1.5998766103714144	1.7323482396098657	1.8837534395275153	1.8964552114380462	2.4080932514725215	5.465036838576198	10.17625579518174	
I must say, every time I see this movie, I am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of Hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. It is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, or pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. Since family is the #1 priority in the Asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first Chinese movie that I actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching. What stands out the most is that Hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some B-movie actor trying to imitate the real person. It shows the genuineness of the movie.	-1.437644218327032	-1.2115001464089714	-0.9615284304018403	-0.7694204936238696	-0.45850709362705727	-0.41449866748395187	-0.2172870696850545	-0.1599032676879084	-0.14805404767588531	-0.03165844608899946	0.022861971347476945	0.1104529276428953	0.23703547079199142	0.2373919612028105	0.249690653333372	0.36048317015405945	0.42303619731385517	0.4372736323270247	0.4417924509161443	0.6052384164320844	0.9382499479506788	1.1226200098876762	1.339188092036738	1.6794744639125911	1.7933585791823443	
Found this film in a DVD discount rack for $10. It wasn't worth it. Some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student. Sandra's performance was somewhat credible, but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged.<br /><br />One thing that I will give them, however. Unlike most action films, people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition.	-2.696834885968989	-1.3432726569182134	-1.150249488423518	-0.7908561715801747	-0.7298279026695651	-0.5352845514155434	-0.5160328481080241	-0.409659561556908	-0.37555722556804844	-0.3248784461053103	-0.2828264350685513	-0.2102404043284869	-0.14912710624611247	-0.01710032618712034	0.06561477025644552	0.06853941993458004	0.18264904180944874	0.321040174405456	0.4354875770428707	0.44807305346352133	0.5418515523788872	0.642093672574047	0.7625291348665918	1.3044219694994024	2.6254180617764797	
Most people miss Hollywood's point of concept. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, within the confines of the law then I, approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savage.<br /><br />In all times of conflict or war, the public and government look for heroes to decorate. The motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All others that follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character, not the 'Man of Bronze'.	-1.7926697188564302	-0.9792450351946338	-0.8352941450708918	-0.7655818828212831	-0.5905965589231533	-0.4478996749044324	-0.2909309783458846	-0.19451095951753525	-0.14740547439115942	-0.12241092376625085	-0.11836226793062098	-0.07671681542855524	-0.03408176228866903	0.08135409340970161	0.24724951707835624	0.30616668461070085	0.3852968453864136	0.39021015098436773	0.49466829899316234	0.5658224628245614	0.5759643976512879	0.6190608680223586	0.9718842240198999	1.0588162708360092	2.7064915439701402	
This typical Mamet film delivers a quiet, evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man (Joe Mantegna) good. Explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences. The cast includes a number of the players found is several of Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy), and they do their usual good job. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film, and have often wondered why she didn't become a more noted player than she has become. Perhaps I'm not looking in the right places!<br /><br />The movie proceeds at a slow pace, with flat dialog, yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending. You'd expect a real let down at the ending, but I found it uplifting and satisfying. I love this movie!	-2.545144120073145	-2.076821485892193	-1.5691981952972978	-1.564380754269	-1.3121277799908484	-0.5772264316468306	-0.53257481240288	-0.02402700049136587	-0.016882987805820704	0.022860774391340558	0.09642206938121192	0.21668586835837067	0.2238119593376508	0.5644590201846598	0.6212633176344938	0.6522269442231468	0.6705965073299622	0.7099759272561786	0.8306246009980474	0.8338335684124087	0.8906725071240016	0.9711718398732625	2.4264199165013833	2.664083975430398	2.978236548128444	
I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday the 13th. There were a number of cheesy elements, yet at the same time there were many cool ones. The story line was good--predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies, but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile. There are some memorable scenes worth watching. A few issues I had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters. For instance in the opening scene the scarecrows (which were humans on stakes, whose blood was drained to grow the crops), looked very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks. There were more than several gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it sounded like how real people talk, unlike Hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it. The culmination of the last scene, when the main character says "I'm not a Baker, I'm a Connell!" and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying, as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point.	-2.7671199058064566	-1.568031743275206	-1.561289747195603	-1.23216769846309	-0.8455022669571449	-0.7422836307566959	-0.5704709736386084	-0.4885398750838169	-0.22370694375197386	-0.08426473266901771	-0.03975026923538805	-0.0326859953049881	0.2418018276237537	0.26008833838178247	0.2677640578227709	0.2730660693121394	0.32746627464280637	0.45463587306621356	0.5457339152642612	0.7968044831906763	0.8366827396298028	1.052870703889215	2.427704105893746	2.4777868931887537	3.5053430449043868	
Without wishing to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /><br />The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams "seriously, you could do better yourself". Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?<br /><br />I bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.	-3.4507080706918636	-1.8549598150771198	-1.8478501316106641	-1.7242148045870993	-1.3697695557461658	-0.7066262997951428	-0.5389818012610952	-0.4481860943975817	-0.3855972656497412	-0.3440676793174604	-0.13044087608249783	-0.055905233160618975	-0.028095302651577066	-0.008288534753909171	0.033365874546381305	0.07880370712046675	0.14778901977287603	0.2837143924923847	0.32076468231354505	0.41166152272857964	0.48108088783671754	0.4878612896134288	1.4245565491346492	1.8620935768010094	3.585913677929105	
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I can't tell if any of them have been successful. It's hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today, especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site. This is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today. Lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway. Now we want to share it with our children ... but we can't? If that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information?	-1.9618543067229846	-1.2723993207196953	-0.7094065609143564	-0.6107059941468242	-0.39643834250154025	-0.2714974514349481	-0.11651052690983021	0.02902050496616116	0.040963987159506124	0.079611021290113	0.10426722148242495	0.17755721537027205	0.27528263032335387	0.31426547685440054	0.381446391786448	0.3828903516645702	0.43951102941594355	0.46989127605496916	0.47266362298181896	0.476524006756721	0.5638129514213803	1.1211258111292763	1.246746709373561	1.8137792764827596	2.1120564842588	
WESTERN UNION tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west. Siblings Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for the Creightons. Indians and some bad white guys get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and vibrant color photography. Scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways, and both he and engineer Young vie for the attention of the perky Gilmore. Lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward.	-1.0121699772513255	-0.9279416948060351	-0.7866211158826548	-0.7668486649920552	-0.36321126266708365	-0.3476648343778095	-0.3269916150937975	-0.26941836953558085	-0.09896130120926648	0.16771313882072192	0.17219533739077408	0.19696604042412674	0.24703211482294538	0.26578027602265464	0.3160860002531152	0.3735064804625242	0.40624652803685785	0.40941206823409715	0.48541680868187553	0.5012615577844036	0.6954768785403486	0.7438830420872978	1.1762048396534337	1.3068844748543451	2.1263392401457204	
No Holds Barred is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously. It sucks hardcore as a serious movie. Look at it more in the way that you should Plan 9 From Outer Space. They are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones that aren't supposed to be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan as only he can play them) grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first meeting with Brell (Kurt Fuller) hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see. It might be the funniest scene ever, I swear.<br /><br />Anyway, how someone thought this movie would make money I'll never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission. I hope they at least got fired. This movie earns a 1 out of 5 on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts.	-1.888839223897409	-1.8338112730574563	-1.5804715025181657	-1.3596250515248656	-1.2650194664559875	-0.6964861628241119	-0.5323369272877424	-0.42364025656073	-0.40136677648840624	-0.3990599098737505	-0.2649122619655212	-0.2340160161506099	0.017138826541119312	0.1336650496601707	0.14044676755466146	0.1699116274590201	0.31102810915716056	0.3898046720924244	0.6795715548259669	0.720031305343706	0.9088412261252004	1.0498222948522073	1.6940892367245732	1.7053806103746654	3.0596534074259636	
...for this movie defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be compared.<br /><br />First off, the beginning did have elements of style....and if handled well, could have become a cult classic, a-la pulp fiction or a Desi desperado...but the plot (was there one?) begins to meander and at one point completely loses it.<br /><br />Throw in a deranged don with an obsession for English, a call center smart Alec, a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a Saree with the same aplomb, a levitating, gravity defying hit-man and a cop with a hundred (or was it a thousand) black cat commandos on their trail....good ingredients in competent hands. But this is where I would like to ask the director: Sir, what were you smoking?<br /><br />Im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers. <br /><br />Possibly the only redeeming feature in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music...watch the videos...hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed. Vishal- Shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes. <br /><br />How I wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy....<br /><br />As I sign off, I want to really, badly know how does Akshay's bullet wound vanish in a microsecond...what were you editors doing?

I doubt if the real story of the development of Western Union would ever have gained a real audience. Instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west, it was the story of board rooms, dominated by one of the most interesting (and disliked) of the great "Robber Barons": Jay Gould. Gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant - and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival Vanderbilt's. But this, while interesting, is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves. At least, that is how audiences would see it. Jay Gould died in 1892. Had he lived into the modern era, and invested in Hollywood, he probably would have agreed to that assessment too.<br /><br />The film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by Indians, spurred on by one Jack Slade (Barton MacLane). Slade, a desperado, is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories. He is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Creighton's associate Richard Blake (Robert Young), and a quasi-lawman Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), who is Slade's brother. Blake, an Easterner with little understanding of the West, is romancing Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings. But he does become a close friend of Shaw, especially in trying to confront Slade.<br /><br />Slade was a real Western criminal, by the way, and the subject of a section of Mark Twain's ROUGHING IT. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he did not have any involvement in stirring up Indians against railroads or telegraph companies. However, MacLane makes him a memorably evil, and totally vicious type. His killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind - and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance. But Lang is responsible for that, as well as other touches. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it. He spits tobacco juice several times while talking to Young, who gets a little splattered. Then there is an Indian attack which we watch from the ground level. At the conclusion, Young suddenly gets splattered again, but it's not brown but red that covers him. He looks up at the pole's top, and there is Wills with an Indian arrow through him.<br /><br />It is an exciting film to watch, and well worth catching.	-8.446766769587123	-4.136728536835177	-3.2451253552643715	-2.588580313606627	-2.4416943081089584	-2.1514830998889543	-2.0070544299391417	-0.9696335365408608	-0.6889996892638837	-0.46455869098111396	-0.2529090251634011	0.36497126572582383	0.5720996421177914	0.640404868888905	0.7017175631021824	0.8766341461028089	1.0568873729211476	1.1135033443760405	1.2249518561873232	1.672066015513867	1.8425247650714895	2.107505083773724	3.1796138303572636	4.369023425486561	10.320233409966896	
THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) **1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir: Patrick Stettner) <br /><br />Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a stand-out low-key performance.<br /><br />What is it about celebrities and fans? What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /><br />In the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, Williams stars as a talk-radio personality named Gabriel No one, who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No one's editor Ashe (Morton) who gives it to No one to read for himself. <br /><br />No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna (Collette giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS. Naturally No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into Donna and Pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate.<br /><br />Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film's novice director Stettner) and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. It helps that Williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.<br /><br />However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.	-4.673959734397414	-2.502899092835902	-2.254348980481748	-2.0651405350940903	-2.0103216724077995	-0.8784501373283268	-0.7228175995555108	-0.6156389784004673	-0.5999562228886075	-0.45393914896527715	-0.25600270681982773	-0.25126139514702894	0.0023202433523206237	0.09469821222088784	0.15887268347968364	0.2207753216520357	0.48921947203530236	0.6988434868577348	0.7143176677924579	0.7513348289419348	1.0275615020496562	1.0696598963211985	1.3221188684449976	2.6649854183234605	4.919913809189775	
I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I didn't rate it as a "great film", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I've seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.	-4.436025872231714	-3.987283991650262	-3.189637514692784	-3.165865201878713	-2.655602376546989	-1.7481659053457752	-1.4162734680547302	-0.9458425025850196	-0.5692008467905044	-0.3634353484045248	-0.1024180181573071	0.13413504880115612	0.24957547973296065	0.26896376898346325	0.5301958703826409	0.536696995327887	0.6739392077914785	0.7228401801194397	0.9814207051500906	1.3104111709200275	1.5676751630202594	1.6734932469761423	3.140821149183481	4.675212162031788	8.019941830675222	
Cuba Gooding Jr. is back on top! Jesus, he did a great job in this film! I LOVED this movie. Its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and volunteer at a mission or something. Anyway, I would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat! Well worth the price of admission. And as for Cuba Gooding Jr., just give him his next Oscar right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-2.6632407490490286	-2.4703701484408955	-0.909737198147196	-0.7241102317228398	-0.5584291918475498	-0.2503210986480357	-0.12405130720099937	-0.07237217127456715	-0.06364442761256486	-0.057252323012392796	0.1927075358337394	0.21107331002717233	0.3608495320194744	0.3767193309055127	0.5569845022195927	0.5709623251958795	0.5711499180792547	0.6066674663777222	0.8266462323338241	0.8960454881103971	0.9385730036348622	0.9942550125690448	1.285356928344511	1.4930007828483978	2.793307936139419	
Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10	-2.3501966249804744	-1.4216822633238118	-0.9927749046827461	-0.8811838338413691	-0.6444120410104499	-0.0783210855321404	-0.005667098674639645	0.0598893609711924	0.12369314399318942	0.25725070646407344	0.3341179872260941	0.37672796177426454	0.40711688948492114	0.4495266980601919	0.4639360810472062	0.4650093028066729	0.5063016982974189	0.534200002159024	0.5924133018817451	0.705916508086775	0.77418935552631	1.084909772113575	2.0943163448821958	2.7454114285855398	3.1659859784870616	
I watched this on an 8 hour flight and (presumably because of the pressure and the altitude) I actually found it mildly entertaining (emphasis on the "mild").<br /><br />The actual idea behind the film was brilliant: a woman dies, her fiancé falls in love with someone else, she decided to make sure they don't get together, but eventually she lets them do it. Sadly the actual film wasn't as good. OK, there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. I think the whole gay-but-not-gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better. The talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest: it wasn't really very funny.<br /><br />In summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me, but it was a close call.	-2.0352834259158983	-1.2481027881368842	-1.1576874343181638	-0.9513717049095394	-0.8277097211691301	-0.6578247687810834	-0.38019670316687876	-0.3492454751471227	-0.08758126570930326	-0.06859130394657662	-0.04401476966712592	0.03906517024936966	0.06476350799939994	0.11136065370151299	0.12905080435987182	0.20230648435307408	0.25908195522956506	0.31478682432110494	0.361500229845947	0.48465999921068753	0.7002290421735611	0.8864531554156607	1.0504273488107878	1.7008184339820984	3.144154233410508	
Three flash-backs introduce the main characters (Abu, Jaffar, and the Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are the songs, each linked to those same characters. Three times does Ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'Time', in his declaration of love to the Princess, answering her three questions at their first of three meetings. So strong is the impression he causes, that the Princess will resist the three attempts by Jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys: deceit, hypnosis, and memory erasing. Yet, Jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical-horse, the Genie, and the The Genie and the magic carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at their first of three encounters; three times does the Genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges, and three are his considerations about human frailty, before he departs. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant-spider, and giant-octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save Ahmad and the Princess, and the bow-and-arrow to execute Jaffar. There's magic in the number three, and there is magic in this movie.	-4.748420074488231	-2.5109515030915257	-2.1966042881098438	-1.8483190814267259	-1.7927991789263027	-0.9677836965752816	-0.3817099433085069	-0.37987627649251243	-0.3288425892273503	-0.24063948524191944	-0.17000577161376373	-0.051925337399496396	-0.01451675564695229	0.1095251295685308	0.3159273455945482	0.4331972537207548	0.6767782563213987	0.7238716109122747	0.7648180687378763	0.8616029569241841	0.9093044330808127	1.0137442894192172	1.185901637865454	3.0653244390504333	5.182680289015976	
I am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. Being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, I bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I'd spent money buying it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is THE HORROR!!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, VERY hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film. The songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head. The dialogue was so lame I felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth. The villain was laughable and I felt myself wanting Derek and Odette to die in the end... and I was absolutely in love with them from the first film.<br /><br />I am going to try repress the memory of this movie, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. There is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. The difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and I began yearning for the first one and wishing I'd never set eyes on the third.<br /><br />Do yourself and favor and don't waste your time.	-6.417157044215188	-3.294946578878879	-3.2917604819295665	-3.2578531514182814	-2.663070834189606	-2.1696445333279377	-1.6849720515510527	-0.8197383997482959	-0.5805066880193364	-0.5345120214194764	-0.2844845293369551	-0.15296631592245152	-0.1526423670525879	0.09284071856352832	0.16223213438840342	0.4375400215641627	0.6405834070912461	0.8146190933073773	0.8528796731585678	1.160957884193078	1.4525389718356245	1.808709466293029	1.8481195476049446	4.076012726328379	7.650205235915504	
NVA combines eastalgia-humor, military comedy and teen movie. Although it is somehow typically German-movie-like sentimental, I think it's a great and very funny movie. You will not only laugh in NVA but also get a bit of an insight in the Eastern Germany armed forces of the late 1980ies and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democratic Republic.<br /><br />You will enjoy NVA if you liked Sonnenallee (another movie directed by Leander Haußmann), but not necessarily if you enjoyed Good Bye Lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny.<br /><br />The acting is acceptable. But watch for former boy band singer Kim Frank who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked saucer-eyed!	-1.0156240979119633	-0.9783107407880062	-0.9731061566296474	-0.925158397803272	-0.8243866389671388	-0.5926724254065469	-0.3008503471736229	-0.21090574970627707	-0.12021223154262793	-0.09593846163970234	-0.06615136113691364	-0.04470738264943909	-0.04161806469704307	-0.012242731619251719	0.10340752066360086	0.13754544427831175	0.25861846698976454	0.29026868330478584	0.35763980597907064	0.48909360957753345	0.6760566628689406	0.6827000223548872	1.2440527348766912	1.2973837358631592	1.9445331645062143	
This wonderful film is a love story, and shows that not all relationships are destined to last. Even so they can be great & worth the pain & suffering of breakup.<br /><br />Director Pieter Verhoeff gives us an insight of the period around 1900, the way society (mis)treats women, and how a very strong woman (Nynke) deals with. With great costumes, landscapes, lovely music and good actors and acting this photoplay draws you in for the length of the movie.<br /><br />At first the ending is a bit sudden, a page describing the rest of her life scrolls. On reflection this is a great (the best) way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life.<br /><br /> This was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles scrolled by (The first being Schindler's List). Apparently the movie had this effect on everybody.	-2.303864564363892	-2.1516635633995334	-1.7973805538077756	-1.2621664223796647	-0.5978172069861515	-0.2867192455475199	-0.14252370822803365	0.06567918585786398	0.12796040090008692	0.1945844519551158	0.48201494048546994	0.5499715756876322	0.5755397072538992	0.5820553877481165	0.8052744567104455	0.8065029685765566	0.861891077039118	0.9227054154034944	0.9251953566683364	0.9684621820027113	1.0466957889743622	1.1849602589498824	2.3042451985755212	3.088508766995358	3.252869354387326	
Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler (A real acting stretch...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network (Because wrestling sells!) however when Rip declines, the network gets a circuit fighting championship called (and i'm totally serious) "Battle of the tough guys" who's champion Zeus (Played by Tiny Lister Jr) maybe the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital. No Holds Barred is pretty much what I expected from Vince McMahon production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre (Hogan) it is basically lots of unintentional humor, tons of awkward sequences, a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words it's not unlike wrestling itself, so I give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they're getting. The movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this. I myself found this to be ultimately hilarious. They're are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself. (Such as the way Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limo, how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way Hogan recites from his cuecard. (I.E:"I'm not going to be around when this check clears!") No Holds Barred is a lot of fun, true, though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. Fans of camp should really enjoy this clever clinker.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)	-3.8073713396831055	-2.321951052189233	-1.984142182853857	-1.4169845673933765	-1.4047498785223083	-1.019741064109858	-0.7783188635614504	-0.46378488223635017	-0.3452562563776025	-0.27333698712619564	-0.17114181021359137	-0.12226455240688808	-0.059828145672189414	-0.02538594791454135	0.1624030564361008	0.21213176586328888	0.3302911932386492	0.585252211095569	0.9250077704844956	1.0649433952875902	1.328336108719804	1.4084839130306472	1.9083707058511206	2.9996945725483473	5.689811785752004	
I originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre. I was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed.<br /><br />Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life and movies. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations. It is interesting (somewhat) but was this really needed? I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just terrible. Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out. I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there. Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker? I do like the fact that they didn't try to make Wood out to be some sort of saint. More than a few of those interviewed (especially Lugosi Jr.) pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear. Also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. Still it's of interest if you're a Wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampira (who tears Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (a long time girlfriend).	-6.293031554207761	-3.0195140353289585	-2.4300079321489547	-2.2064143661676443	-2.134578753254672	-2.102581634839495	-1.8334083741251004	-0.9345014588976793	-0.6443665726717754	-0.5881592768334019	-0.4595285962913397	0.07245118988452684	0.11126261484572596	0.1469028782636131	0.2602516359340446	0.33864405549738674	0.37575267954233965	0.6813946483568173	0.7823704572812988	1.1404680228269861	1.162965148112649	1.6808337515360359	1.7843078619719195	3.397656986721334	7.181624149867744	
I love documentaries. The Andy Goldsworthy doc was great.I looked forward to this one - but was very disappointed. I knew of Kahn and was intrigued by the idea of his lonely death in a Penn Station men's room. There must be a story here, I mistakenly believed.The only story here is of sadly deluded women who had affairs with an ugly little famous married man. In the absence of anything like an explanation for this guy's horrible behavior, we're given endlessly repeated clips of Kahn walking around and painfully long - supposedly contemplative - shots of his soulless buildings.Actually, some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think about the guy himself. The overwrought soundtrack references an emotional tug that is entirely absent from the film. Kahn's apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyr his mistresses. This film seems to want to give Kahn the great artiste's free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures - I don't buy it.	-2.8063510258788216	-1.6494633441945152	-1.6469518359796205	-1.4971307025158036	-1.3423842996146003	-1.0283134760921255	-0.8935234584561589	-0.6193957129297939	-0.5386779454502036	-0.16661146825339856	-0.16047250655806194	-3.328671061141736E-4	0.0018069731887803975	0.038800292032619026	0.03935038922588385	0.07711152508303784	0.30282866405153885	0.35264959483536723	0.4152562700421363	0.4730506228696433	0.6135453399281451	0.7613508817413709	0.8527190861588092	1.794302285097475	3.4738509833303044	
The writer/director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film. I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey, because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun. <br /><br />The story was awful, the characters were very one dimensional. For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans, that someone is kidding their self (it was probably the writer/director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. To go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker. Keep your day job. And if it's playing poker, then you must be hurt'n.	-4.62611335530403	-1.8127989797710249	-1.6593334495098904	-1.6320940418473067	-1.488053552789467	-1.3522247596868886	-1.252221583248111	-0.49174411788804373	-0.2382616083893313	-0.10251192827162955	-0.08827846591134372	0.1637232387504377	0.17919322465725596	0.2051237038650946	0.24363967438253353	0.24555419443086787	0.49703699426808917	0.6149132685871561	0.6298846448159262	0.6551939293382253	0.67651701972009	0.7701044514336828	2.070854128623217	2.353234269372737	5.1790889244908165	
Did anyone else feel as betrayed as I did? The first hour or so was pretty solid but the last. Oh my god. It seemed like it was predictable and cheesy. Not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been. Most reviews have read have been glowing but I really can't understand why. I had seriously predicted that general ending WAY earlier on but then retracted it because I thought "No, they would never do that, that's FAR too lame." I can hardly stand it. I feel so unsatisfied. I think i'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season I own. Someone please. Change my mind. I want to love this. SO bad. Someone tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. Terrible ending.	-5.29325548988345	-3.3822990943482685	-2.869630153652042	-2.684278643292639	-1.908052725622383	-1.6602561691806288	-1.3101202525456066	-0.46844506858897755	-0.36973632983715016	-0.32502728096891864	-0.2799173190721216	-0.2449285648230672	-0.11976891288445425	-0.11663395671208178	0.021083561890005542	0.10809022455529896	0.17603926398870756	0.61769051502314	1.034960567216768	1.109894266727611	1.4705194721422303	1.753135705676327	2.032503084153328	3.875991470623486	6.548990200860944	
I initially bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, little did I know that Aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with SRK and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance. It's a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie. It's actually a dream sequence that occurs while SRK's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day, dressed scantily and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (loosely translated as "Love's a bitch!") and it is just plain smoking hot! Don't miss it.	-2.4818347136622947	-2.0487672355216797	-1.6277484500065924	-1.3269108436724741	-0.7548920497022686	-0.6260834565665181	-0.5782465694596557	-0.5455253960467705	-0.20575495956917225	-0.18747565057794002	-0.17830394392715698	0.007361411037809448	0.03243329004365897	0.04557020181317578	0.07760250688925835	0.10262516002445246	0.1978871026564372	0.4226763310864015	0.4521943005102225	0.6319648282104434	0.7298820079716742	0.7542021214572692	1.8286714552665375	2.0291986890622944	3.583246866199228	
I disagree with Anyone who done't like this movie. <br /><br />I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do. It's sweet, funny and warms your heart. And It proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /><br />And even though it didn't have much of a story, it was still excellent I give it a 10 and two thumbs up. <br /><br />Oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish's and dreams can come true. (Tear, tear)<br /><br />I love this movie, personally if anyone says it sucked than I will say "Shame on you." Because it was a delightful little movie and I'm glad that at least SOME people liked it.	-3.284309808399063	-1.6689177805257855	-1.204153068495169	-1.0460842927248089	-0.9241566514212599	-0.3351831672966774	-0.2994430534384465	-0.18820130836326338	0.015029836359338345	0.3021178347817679	0.3846636797858528	0.48751790700067793	0.5168626000196445	0.519595226901574	0.7125290363281949	0.7421746482855806	0.7508104533504386	0.8199842457712645	0.8652991779846341	1.0363333945777753	1.3645333224947482	1.5013018303178662	1.614883169028628	1.6896695167919966	3.2549528260796396	
2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous.<br /><br />I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Henry Thomas - how could it miss. I was wrong.<br /><br />I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble. I'd long suspected Sam S. of being kind of nuts, this film, based on his play, confirms it.<br /><br />This is the kind of artsy b.s. that actors LOVE to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote. However, for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash, there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie.<br /><br />You haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch. Pa is crazy, Ma is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, oh yeah, crazy. They also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter.<br /><br />In addition to the above, as if that weren't enough, the plot--and it's so thin you could read thorough it--has a hole in it the size of Alaska.<br /><br />Ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm. As it turns out so is Pa. Now I don't claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, and therefore, his plot does not work.<br /><br />Not that anything else was really working anyway.<br /><br />The only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to.	-8.84461275374837	-4.242966989808605	-4.189951212062282	-3.7939978242487413	-3.734407260192393	-2.013058573734064	-1.4960988349802928	-1.0295714759850243	-1.0226862597195792	-0.9795717809643494	-0.850414866609408	-0.1584537143300659	-0.08797682940898437	-0.07416492112759515	-0.030078879782831927	0.1386311063789552	0.6941773138600404	1.2652247087038841	1.4196576364574762	1.6069135847340112	1.8164373772418188	1.8803434822336709	2.3495223808359564	4.309894319369045	8.858633775323364	
As a poker enthusiast I was looking forward to seeing this movie - Especially as it had Scotty Nyugen in it.<br /><br />Basically, Scotty Nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it.<br /><br />The characters are unlikeable and annoying, the soundtrack is awful and the plot, well, there isn't one.<br /><br />I honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was THAT bored. Its actually ashame that Nyugen was in this movie as otherwise I wouldn't have wasted $16 buying it off Ebay.<br /><br />Take it from me - AVOID like 7 2 offsuit!!!

Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. This is simply a "run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.<br /><br />There's nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. Here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they're actually a lot worse. You don't care about these characters, AT ALL. The plot is nonexistent, the music poor (apart from one Simon Boswell song), it's not scary in the least; it's just not that good.<br /><br />Easily the worst film Dario Argento has been involved with and Lamberto Bava's also (Bava has a cameo in this film, not a very funny one).<br /><br />Maybe 3 is too high a rating, but at least I could watch it all and didn't think of stopping midway. My advice; Stick to the original.	-5.849426375256622	-2.795370277713313	-2.7770929686568047	-2.7616532943165293	-2.628421912611502	-1.7023033282958755	-1.172179819666165	-0.7415424885467321	-0.6333843130518433	-0.46365393899353624	-0.4036881293939279	-0.36537879339967394	-0.13717152464261695	0.16686481613862503	0.307145887283955	0.35335951320588854	0.47480997210321824	0.4863656708454967	0.639491701674822	0.8405456210693978	1.2154543621672866	1.262162175150487	2.0479321400241566	3.619483393734435	6.7338508956444345	
For those of you still in the dark, I will not spoil this Christie, as it is definitely one of her finest works, and I stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time! If any of the adaptations are to be watched before (or in lieu of) reading the book, I would suggest "After the Funeral" for the following reasons.<br /><br />I wanted to praise the performance by Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer-companion Cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film. Her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman is actually moving, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person who travels alone in "the journey of life." And when the murderer is being revealed in typical Poirot denouement fashion, Dolan's reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest: you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to Miss Gilchrist... something uncommon in Christie lore.<br /><br />Although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation, as per usual (the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film), the unbelievably lavish recreation of post-war England, thoroughly high calibre of acting and directing, and preservation (if not heightening) of Christie's mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies insignificant.<br /><br />Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre, and the producers who gave it the green light!

Let me say from the outset I'm not a particular fan of this kind of film, but Nightbreed holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective.<br /><br />Back in the old days, the folks who inhabit Midian would have been called Zombies, the undead. And according to what Clive Barker has given us certain members of human kind, in this Craig Sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world.<br /><br />Psychiatrist David Cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the Nightbreed. He tricks the police into killing Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to a graveyard named Midian cemetery where the Nightbreed congregate and live underground. <br /><br />Sheffer has also left a girl friend, Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for him even after he's been killed and is now one of the undead. She tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind. <br /><br />Clive Barker's creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans. But it's plain to see that if humans left them alone, the Nightbreed in turn not bother with them.<br /><br />Your sympathies are definitely with the Nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like Cronenberg and redneck police chief Charles Haid in action.<br /><br />Clive Barker's been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the Nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people. I can see where that would come in, especially since there are a whole lot of people who don't even think of gays as anything human because they're taught that way.<br /><br />Granted Nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence, but it also does make you think and I do like the way Clive Barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes Craig Sheffer a kind of messiah for the Nightbreed creatures.	-5.223981962148823	-2.598814101180658	-2.048136621735631	-1.8702304556344795	-1.6670744955495784	-1.4380452989530534	-0.808222263238293	-0.7790305336079385	-0.6710877021317195	-0.5549509862530279	-0.4524632532720648	-0.14323081668258372	-0.1317290688282748	0.1292907702937282	0.4828003337117575	0.6076442844222454	0.611857403713204	0.8514099142987734	0.9795666364938657	1.0084795761123608	1.0384179725717995	1.0764495738646518	1.2166930437699173	2.9262537062497693	5.735118964671938	
We also found this movie on the discount rack and made the mistake of purchasing it because Sandra Bullock was featured on the cover. The cinematography was terrible and the back of the DVD box told more about the plot than the movie itself.

I started watching the show from the first season, and at the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it. Original movie was kind of childish, and I was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the BSG new season.<br /><br />But after few episodes I became a fan. I've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is Jack O'Neill, the not-only-smart Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, women and kids favorite, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson.<br /><br />Of course, stories sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend, even risking your life for him. It's about "we don't leave anybody behind". Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will, and all good qualities that makes a human - Human.<br /><br />And now it's breaking a record, going 10th season, and still doing good.	-1.8393572237559312	-1.4400295242012726	-1.2977650828831704	-1.0333278735754856	-0.8372368525688705	-0.8337497422064194	-0.7717979906721798	-0.5593252456382087	-0.523309167614504	-0.249039386808938	-0.21016401151893316	-0.08848429598624724	-0.006144864610534595	0.10369233805747809	0.1445658372568268	0.1714617986957602	0.20226129344823787	0.4466476026729612	0.7713911834802224	1.1414864439717451	1.1907998297378497	1.2380638862621356	1.3052129973470685	2.2468619809984847	3.146029659545372	
After a good start, it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than thou propaganda i've ever seen. This movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the "holy bible".<br /><br />To resume the...OK let's call it a plot... Basically alien don't abduct people (that we already know..). No, in fact its demonic forces abducting people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft, or read porno magazine (as one protagonist does).<br /><br />It's complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must blindly follow Christ to be saved.<br /><br />a quote sums it all , imagine a subtle piano music in the background : "You can't let others, even those you love, stop you from following the Lord.."<br /><br />and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age...still work to do.

Masters of Horror: The Screwfly Solution starts as America is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population, when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of God. Scientist Alan (Jasn Priestley) is brought in by the Government & knows more than most & senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife Anne (Kerry Norton) to take their teenage daughter Amy (Brenna O'Brien) & try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them...<br /><br />This Canadian American co-production was episode 7 from season 2 of the Masters of Horrror TV series, directed by Joe Dante I thought The Screwfly Solution was pretty bad. I personally think the script by Sam Hamm sucks, it takes itself far too seriously & I don't really understand why it's part of the Masters of Horror series, the horror that the filmmakers are going for in The Screwfly Solution is in the actual story itself & themes & ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it's gets the chance during it's short 60 odd minute running time which I felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up. I wasn't happy with the inconsistencies with the story either, if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman's neck on the plane? Was he sexually aroused, I think not. Why does every bloke then think he's killing in the name of God? I just can't see every single bloke on Earth suddenly knowing the Bible & starting to believe in God, I just found the notion ridiculous & the show also states clearly that there's nothing religious about what's going on so what's the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see? Then there's the fact people get turned on by different things, what about gays for instance? Will they kill guys instead of women? I know there's a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it's conveniently brushed to one side & then there's the thing which annoyed me the most. The fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho & killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened, it just felt so stupid, the plotting is rubbish & to round things off there's a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of The X-Files (1993 - 2002) with a bright neon alien.<br /><br />Director Dante on this showing definitely doesn't qualify as a Master of Horror as far a I'm concerned, the story is badly paced, it's just so stupid considering it's played deadly straight & instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it's deadly virus on the loose situation & the subsequent mother & daughter on the run because of it, there's very little here in the way of what I would call effective horror & even less gore. There's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle, a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle & another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about.<br /><br />Technically like the other episodes it's really good & it doesn't have the look of a cheap TV series, the special effects are great as usual & it's well made. The acting is alright but no-one really stood out.<br /><br />The Screwfly Solution is easily the worst Masters of Horror episode I've seen but bear in mind I haven't seen all of them... yet. As a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me & as a show made by a so-called Master of Horror it disappoints me even more.	-9.281611768565478	-4.986524034970748	-4.525489222523957	-4.502627152545351	-4.374113383169346	-2.7690845870436784	-1.6445474810229876	-1.0601351331130864	-0.8263239135652439	-0.6780227128267797	-0.6594386358804013	-0.4364658698940093	-0.2130770879828333	0.07987546483876257	0.29694327719486024	0.4008050571788958	0.4262404250195712	1.0096401011485692	1.044076398982725	1.2686221773160833	1.5312983447191522	1.7410736954851962	3.8126304766187222	5.3541469205606775	10.338153938330349	
Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950's teens in turmoil movie. It is not a horror or science fiction movie. Plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their "hot rod" club because they cannot meet the rent. Once kicked out, they decide to try an old Haunted House. The only saving grace for the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the She Creature suit) turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by Blaisdell.	-2.734220683744611	-0.9420531732968935	-0.792698125903714	-0.7457601923001892	-0.6337706504127341	-0.4824975796414651	-0.4801471288710646	-0.45586031557486795	-0.2872612943133082	-0.1985211586742105	-0.13322781823237842	-0.0840092757214499	0.03829458568978135	0.0958658521967474	0.10290706223786118	0.1725029778066411	0.1863331754140441	0.28565679877844835	0.2879192735956884	0.3246211263339654	0.33262303474526994	0.5499214105506924	0.9302849763193286	1.5058147885766802	2.71032983885683	
Warning: This review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very dull movie. Where the heck are the Graboids??? <br /><br />Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes I'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a "character study". Unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Drago's character who is given too few lines, too little to do and in the end too little screen time. What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch. However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /><br />On the plus side when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long. Pretty good for straight to video. But after watching it I'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any. Was there a rush to get this movie made? I think not, more time could have and should have been spent on the script.<br /><br />I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with....Tremors!!! What luck I thought, pay for #4 get #1 for free. Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can't imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4. For fans of the series it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists.<br /><br />Tremors 4: The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10.	-8.425524677115275	-4.398087762251384	-3.972071477179524	-3.6782078818288673	-3.2579294212727583	-1.9825883000837907	-1.890639533632913	-1.8832387828025963	-1.0731019832531163	-0.530235930253413	-0.5102453984184251	-0.37863769902796673	-0.3072766308025462	0.43555891477488357	0.4718555559512189	0.6165395484797027	0.9249727907387963	1.2589825061172393	1.2634435890301792	1.6349360891423301	1.7111313277556754	1.9377205704549951	2.06731367733824	4.663756215362158	9.305488386025715	
The story-line of "The Thief of Bagdad" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffar's deeds and hate him. He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief. The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra. There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by. Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. Then he is captured. When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog. Jaffar then asks for the Princess's hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra. The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog. The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. He does awaken her. She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmad's sight and turn Abu back into a thief. The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. For freeing him, he gets three wishes. His first is for sausages. In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad. The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the All-Seeing eye. Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue. Abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees Ahmad in a canyon. He has the genie take him to Ahmad. Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. She smells a flower and forgets everything at once. Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad. Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the 'eye'. Abu finds himself in the "Land of Legend", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess. The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda. The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography. The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating. The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes. The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar. Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan. As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also. Its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. This is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.	-8.023156280792096	-7.926187287012522	-5.9981827904624	-5.840457331470097	-3.828638123275666	-2.6490100817733047	-1.2699663069021738	-1.0704327745250997	-1.0324795505200823	-0.8732717141929207	-0.42212147305317627	-0.27765093292953924	-0.010686160355411894	0.1196961340325784	0.41207591314279224	1.348864903452109	2.1129607369058734	2.1269353780971523	3.1742649458829924	3.2495815944469557	4.145618972081807	4.876673439501886	8.368365373990088	8.561844981978945	14.926535215107574	
I'm not great at writing reviews, so I'll just spout my opinions...<br /><br />I loved this series at first. The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis... I loved them all. Davis, it seemed, was the fifth-most important person in the cast. Not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I don't know whether it's because Hammond was more important that I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****.<br /><br />The first seven seasons, though, were awesome. The movie Stargate seemed mediocre the first time I saw it, but it turned out to be, even if this wasn't the original intention, a brilliant setup to the series. I recommend that you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around, believe me), and then watch the rest of the TV series.<br /><br />The last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven, but that doesn't mean they aren't good. It just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons.<br /><br />After you have finished this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.<br /><br />EDIT on 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It is a great loss.	-3.395358309770392	-2.3726608040871344	-2.0709640599167125	-2.0295778769916155	-1.9286293543811877	-1.6138270532745473	-1.3239808007782512	-0.8305014847302651	-0.35618704372759225	-0.2798316339228906	-0.16287815639051556	0.07699704918020997	0.2878589322296437	0.34584661191218424	0.42462117027316365	0.47505628180291903	0.9623467001808813	0.9754323277830759	1.2065517254408615	1.3936225110394096	1.4148231394666555	2.034057935918046	3.3988545097635887	4.16785936248805	5.993849538608865

It's got Christopher Lee, it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen, it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises, it's got volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax the entire planet blows up. How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly, mind-numbingly DULL? The answer, my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots, most of them involving long tracks, pans, or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting in cars and driving... I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering "Say something, please somebody, just say something... DO something... anything!..."<br /><br />The dialogue, when it does come, is terrible.<br /><br />"Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours." was a typically meaningless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage, justified in this speech from Lee as the head alien:<br /><br />"The planet Earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe. All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!" <br /><br />This is is Neanderthal SF script writing. This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds. It is, and I collect such things, the most god-awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired. It beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters.<br /><br />Lee, who always struck me as a smart, useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits, delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek. I don't blame him.	-6.159903084022211	-4.085540866724138	-3.0275445069437223	-2.1898718084881064	-1.8155332140108094	-1.7522275959669449	-0.8125286635758997	-0.6542203976707452	-0.5985990192921224	-0.49130257615363554	-0.36594145550533963	-0.3362028957392195	-0.22639964080400912	-0.2249089366634109	-0.22082735378706242	0.1058812198061266	0.1834274436648336	0.7026742052875212	0.9702808662161436	1.123120377822489	1.8712122089469156	1.944999327140569	1.9662922767533992	3.4548964157937436	6.210233951376869	
The prior comments are way to generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as "beyond belief!" "no words can express how I feel about this" "This movie will move you" As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie. On the other hand, one (former) friend says I owe him 90 minutes of his life back. I particularly enjoyed the "gun's eye view" of parts of the movie. Truly awesome in it's absurdity.	-2.5383667480002883	-1.497168553942206	-1.4703202318599864	-0.9304907636268052	-0.8673115506535132	-0.7442606615267343	-0.6152386694751746	-0.45439401214627373	-0.1593404814608949	-0.10973696326486738	-0.06974140385712331	-0.004887992420185006	0.10459690799363301	0.21381952645769947	0.2347322641559243	0.4213404450284415	0.4406659110577836	0.46480000251466175	0.613755801498308	0.661124445910892	0.7195360590934617	1.1948209197653392	2.210509162567211	2.446075797615526	3.24194910448638	
How many more of those fake "slice of life" movies need to be made? Hopefully not too many.<br /><br />Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood. Nothing wrong with that in general. What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly "edgy" Hollywood independent production.<br /><br />It's supposed to be "real" so left shake the camera "documentary style", except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose...<br /><br />It's "edgy" so let's not waste any time lighting the film.<br /><br />It's "hip", so let's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface...<br /><br />And so on, and so forth. All that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the "rarefied" indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film.	-5.0087821909367936	-2.2053096398878256	-1.8760560913984126	-1.8282716120843996	-1.7339975023154592	-1.2874176684431433	-0.766812488436531	-0.6083362883669187	-0.46713285804964605	-0.3228206498896078	-0.30447371744744534	-0.04317479045040619	0.015753669171700194	0.07996283586412846	0.14564644559363824	0.20501036849020687	0.2087060431820955	0.3133398579923828	0.3894431424005931	0.5596867377966532	0.6077366438145959	0.7305905611020573	2.060254951026355	2.6707641235333583	4.943187138949488	
I'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am I bothered by the cynical, self-righteous stance the makers of this crap take.<br /><br />What I AM bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if ALL of the episodes were staged. Hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than Oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot.<br /><br />The premise would have turned out great - if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer. If only this idea were free of all the legal complications/trappings that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people, and what is eventually aired. Hence the only way to create this """reality show""" was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise (and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time!). Shouldn't this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school? Most reviews I read here don't even mention that any of this is fake, let alone that all of it might be. Wishful thinking or just boundless naivety? <br /><br />The actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottom-of-the-barrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables, waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show (or this crap), which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks. I even recognized one actress (in the role of "cheater") that I saw years earlier in "The Jerry Springer Show". And I only saw 6-7 episodes of "Cheaters". How many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in Springer and "Cheaters" that I don't even know about?<br /><br />However, to compare "Cheaters" with Springer isn't fair to the latter. The Springer show is not all fake; a bulk of the episodes are unstaged - hence often highly entertaining. There is no value to be found in "Cheaters", unless you're a struggling actor and want to get tips on how NOT to act in front of the camera.<br /><br />The producers use various (very cheap, transparent) tricks to create the illusion of realness, to give their footage that elusive documentary feel. But it's all in vein. In the end, the more intelligent train-wreck-seeking viewer is left with absolutely squat. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.	-10.99743575628581	-5.049262173406495	-4.457560398572699	-3.906072489214077	-3.7699740543748623	-3.00131738825158	-2.9590105679715517	-1.0717115037663993	-0.8870179643026006	-0.7365276144339445	-0.5537735220322311	-0.14340444670700497	0.12817869340020763	0.6832768676493589	0.8767197754111603	0.8904140802143619	1.001264998694284	1.061102696829787	1.2532228827322383	1.2583093777836687	1.284880637607615	1.704944289016555	3.393097326128672	6.002050687997014	11.665457923730782	
I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal. His character is like all of us. Wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliver.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.<br /><br />I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry's basically self-centered TV anchorman wanna-be but that's the way it was written.<br /><br />I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened.<br /><br />I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep. This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.<br /><br />A funny film.	-1.5667690762845607	-1.5618470982057566	-1.3645063042530814	-1.25978220879874	-0.8977933544652776	-0.8935694001351759	-0.5568941253252266	-0.21762041369127125	-0.11293409835796175	-0.05915745724137824	0.06832917542146882	0.08837202756147688	0.11868845199462923	0.14713624131042924	0.1743748067212099	0.2145575806486058	0.290112618531973	0.3850802093304188	0.5586859258955796	0.9644427101331081	1.2498626571366787	1.463644627016639	1.7544001361548758	2.1630705217556616	2.738840444574356	
I've read the positive comments on this movie. I assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why I watched this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed even once during the duration of this film. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was off. If you liked it, maybe you should lay off the buds because you need to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left. This movie had a poor script, bad acting, poor directing, weak plot... nothing of virtue and was not entertaining. If you haven't seen this movie, don't.	-3.4953332567198094	-2.2691711932504575	-2.0429574827746846	-1.7300308199692438	-1.6086021934936494	-1.595280589279383	-1.1734862737590634	-0.76368873295635	-0.20906869988978477	-0.14854227635948247	-0.14206917923712448	-0.08592790088332318	-0.05034909187564733	0.08098965198339576	0.15093767171756645	0.36606311662733865	0.4770601568075922	0.5831514728300629	0.6273388987087987	0.6777578038298507	0.7301130789815569	0.7784933384369841	0.9198061117162217	2.7835834479665555	4.413593204986285	
This series is set a year after the mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate. It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goa'uld (Ra's race) come from? How many are there? <br /><br />The first episode has a retired Jack O'Neill (spelled with 2 Ls) recalled to active duty by General George Hammond due to an attack by the shut down Stargate from Apophis, a powerful Goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the Stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now. We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial. Then Daniel's wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /><br />It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams, in which Jack's team will be SG-1 which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a Goa'uld homeworld to rescue Daniel's wife and another one captured at Abydos named Ska'ra. They get captured, and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Teal'c, First Prime of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is made part of SG-1. <br /><br />That was only the beginning of the adventure. In the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of Goa'uld called the Tok'ra, in which Samantha's Dad becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little race in which we see Thor most often (he's Jack's buddy),and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.<br /><br />The show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons. In season nine, a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients. Season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. <br /><br />Very well-produced, interesting characters, fantastic Special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all. A different way of travelling the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, this is one show you don't want to miss. Unlock the gate and step through. You won't regret it!	-7.355002060603174	-3.678697564175308	-2.806552816315363	-2.520477280471332	-2.175078040300414	-2.008129669447531	-1.8250115974545351	-1.0016406981896715	-0.7955428836005508	-0.6279512209791673	-0.40419111271512975	-0.07601469959351395	0.25876217434621457	0.6155466191722972	0.6408243624188251	0.7787276837652753	0.8035110618800677	1.0416868823553418	1.1950255268032228	1.3154783014160782	1.329127932484481	1.607814067238325	2.427325049667105	3.6744598027657887	8.82669827296983	
This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon. Sure, its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still, this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not, and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive. Its not The Fisher King, but its not crap, either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead (I love Mel as a Director and Writer, not so much as a lead).	-2.181696931457236	-1.792305566092184	-1.2543726485238842	-1.036350348090537	-0.9168748475644126	-0.7008451016839333	-0.6338476582978044	-0.16379117872486115	-0.12764749008412896	-0.09157129331682366	-0.07791920477674863	0.04579500880662306	0.05031980080902704	0.10055297309979508	0.1072048395137863	0.15571756422180374	0.31415145643715703	0.4569113762018262	0.5339006271104318	0.5846389424515492	0.5949169216683647	0.6858792458810667	1.2755747585234436	1.9024050565612527	3.4264790791077306	
What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to "fine-tune" the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.<br /><br />The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never gets): If it works, don't screw with it!<br /><br />azjazz	-4.929705899133747	-1.8414338518211293	-1.5652971924895143	-1.3709469866006792	-1.2823844383424974	-1.2712000729999926	-1.1997117122999317	-0.762102318059894	-0.42222711708179655	-0.13679488506313434	-0.11409685225237932	-0.09624756822003286	-0.06953832516046154	0.22631222039319743	0.24473020558696226	0.26478599738853403	0.2753996565385715	0.311454337624713	0.33282875320795724	0.4833544194923323	0.5101993465973941	0.6854488397273238	1.899371381466499	2.2344690208663733	5.027671961043067	
I must say I'm an avid horror movie fan, and currently I can't get enough of foreign horror. Since US horror really depends too much on gore.<br /><br />This movie is fantastic. This movie reminded me a lot of M. Night's SIXTH SENSE. The way the film was directed was great. The director took his time to set everything up. It took about a good 40 mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie. I thought the movie was just a drama. This movie just builds up and the pay off isn't too much.<br /><br />I've never done this before, but this is the main reason I liked the movie.... I actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me... which is kinda pathetic.... but for a film to do that, it's great.	-1.930741552540596	-1.3646651025533685	-0.9365994352518601	-0.8564167730404748	-0.756380191732698	-0.2475049242031988	-0.22602734012693582	-0.20953701568927724	-0.12189708178767686	-0.10951128740480753	-0.05056960708147315	0.002206318245208859	0.012378761972985666	0.06228552231030525	0.12711592601837562	0.24345671507941027	0.3050876160209822	0.3236337749188183	0.5215624554046582	0.5658932048187824	0.689164397815927	1.1691602208246925	1.1743725261291647	1.5115097627325518	1.9165910210477424	
I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I don't think so.<br /><br />What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.<br /><br />Where to start? Okay..<br /><br />1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.<br /><br />2) No ricochet. Metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet.<br /><br />3) Magic bullets? In one scene a bad-guy is standing right in front of a good-guy when another good-guy pops out behind the bad-guy and pumps him full of metal. You see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist, but the good-guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) After having just splattered a human being all over the wall, the two good-guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft-guns.<br /><br />5) Sound? At one point the good-guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm?). The lady screams out "Alarm in sector blah blah" and the bad-guy boss says "Okay.. this.. is.. not.. a.. drill.. blah blah" in a very, very amateur kinda way. Ooh, we're getting ambushed by terrorists, this isn't a drill, but I'm gonna sound like I don't give crap.<br /><br />6) Focus!! First you see the bad-guys load up on weapons. For some reason the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Deja vu or loop of scenes? You literally see every single bad-guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way. The weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad-guy extra no. XX locks and loads. When they started opening fire you HAD to see the barrel flashes. Boooring!! 7) Actors or dummies? One of the presumed good-guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad-guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smoke-blind or something so they don't see it coming. They cough and moan as if it was Anthrax in the grenade. Then a semi-boss bad-guy arrives and he doesn't even cough when he enters the smoke, he just pushes the other bad-guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn't Anthrax anyway.<br /><br />8) B flick? I think yeah! A guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a Uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently. I'd like to see a guy fire a Uzi with one hand and I'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards. Extra bloody gore mess in a B flick kinda way. Small *pops* and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead. Though the first bullet hit his heart the good-guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy.<br /><br />9) One of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip! How stupid can you be!? Always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes, the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building. Cut to the action if you're going for a B flick movie, please.<br /><br />My two cents on this movie.	-22.776952592436768	-9.110686773334875	-8.28381362026414	-5.9029630840796425	-4.217831570850353	-4.176818714031443	-4.130113055859948	-3.86079605799389	-3.4114028856887133	-2.6462520880218503	-2.2784383524240335	-2.2759667788544045	-2.1610864053498138	-0.5904551534237015	-0.586766950295998	-0.35967475714087904	0.687867053480656	1.1658960760639596	2.0942898697703467	2.3569541670220375	2.4008602498549356	3.355883782281095	7.03345980723379	8.943120051743588	18.914550912226666	
STRANGER THAN FICTION angered me so much, I signed up on IMDb just to write this review. STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and thought-provoking movie until the very end. Once you suspend multiple lapses of logic (why didn't Will Ferrell hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book? "The phone rang. The phone rang again." How could she not know it's him calling? etc.), the movie challenges one's thoughts about mortality, fate, and sacrifice.<br /><br />The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain former English majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, even though Will Ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul. Her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith.<br /><br />Ah, but the ending. Until the very end, I would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie. The movie as a metaphor for life's journey, as a tribute to the notion of 'writing true,' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy, but not both, is outstanding. The entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's fate. And no matter how endearing a character he may have become, we know full well why we will accept the ending. The last act occurs, the screen goes white, the credits roll. A profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film. An end that would have been debated for weeks.<br /><br />NO!!!!!!!!!! No credits rolled. Say it isn't so. Say Hollywood didn't tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie. Dustin Hoffman got it right when he said, "It's no longer a masterpiece; it's OK." An apt review of the movie. Except to me, it wasn't even OK. I was so offended about the betrayal of 'writing true,' about the decision to pander the film that I actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie. I don't often cry. I could care less about most movies, but I am still angry about this one.<br /><br />My questions for Zack Helm, the writer, are this: did the original movie end when the screen went white? And were you forced by the vapid movie powers-that-be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie? Or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself? I've read you're brilliant. I hope your original script ended the movie the first time.<br /><br />I know Zack Helm will never see this review, and I've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself. But, please, movie-goers, am I the only one who feels this way about STRANGER THAN FICTION? One good thing came from me seeing this movie: I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now.	-7.1476032745705735	-5.487025332080979	-5.408070978317999	-3.255483432340441	-2.0810169948115056	-1.3588468266442892	-1.1809502584837037	-0.9386528439524171	-0.40397896291483976	0.073372633050942	0.39324475241891765	0.6455941693067612	0.7336071175125595	0.8300417010224254	0.9166915519432768	1.029621706167453	1.170792978311921	1.3103221616958798	1.5879739802188113	1.7469309682312186	2.1899752868151325	3.472968810380364	5.978989514875083	6.23927467945408	11.95148819328658	
The film is excellent. One of the most noteworthy things about it is that Flynn's performance is superb. This is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by Bette Davis et al.<br /><br />I remember the scene where Flynn gets Arthur Kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The cold, calculating look on Flynn's face as he does so is extraordinary - much better than the much vaunted Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done.<br /><br />The other thing to note is the excellent performance by George P. Huntley Jr as Lt "Queen's Own" Butler. It is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor.	-2.3927352332765675	-1.753703563134972	-1.140113542815401	-1.032415131476411	-1.0319822157637757	-0.3432069760187831	-0.26570565992307943	-0.13023463510002609	-0.09004295446951953	0.17845597715993947	0.2506749545282019	0.3169166057977789	0.34365767261803515	0.45564581987246067	0.4956833940197398	0.5816291001393743	0.6468330760087764	0.6852207989352661	1.046302854315369	1.1406074466150877	1.196537985293025	1.746235253206349	1.8954942816999458	2.50168031397583	2.5605338858272413	
I'm not really sure what to make of this movie, especially after seeing a great film like La Notte. Unfortunately I saw this in German during an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum, so I didn't get to hear Malkovich's great voice. He is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in Italy. However, as good an actor as he is, Malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here: a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby. Then the two of them go home, have sex, and he leaves. It seems as if Antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films (like The Passenger) when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity.<br /><br />However nonsensical the storyline is, the film features two things that make it watchable: eye and ear candy. The actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is marvelous - scenes in old Italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city (reminiscent of La Notte).<br /><br />The ear candy, however, is what really makes the film worth watching. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence," both of which set the mood perfectly in the film. The songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."	-1.8355419212194444	-1.8032429436320807	-1.6097895121649417	-1.3107312811894392	-1.00297192845144	-0.7566854179137726	-0.46790700803693724	-0.29490006477070024	-0.26589049577125023	-0.20814408149047356	-0.15826232322391942	0.11144296639186593	0.1196670119434457	0.1502205440422651	0.1788422916710357	0.3101775324220624	0.4568074607869931	0.6051979339214656	0.6061815354280148	0.8964471787262651	0.9474297491193601	1.3350053022630548	2.0504196517930136	2.1663325473396164	3.6603019959760412	
What can I say after I say the one line summary. Sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it can't save it. Way too much pre occupation with guns. How can the Hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns?? It's just worse than expected.	-2.142499438139791	-1.291452982961175	-1.0000562492693181	-0.9863832485192446	-0.9248322427422906	-0.8543257380302443	-0.6906510559532664	-0.4818921977211678	-0.19469960650374812	-0.16790169490808482	-0.16166107098467095	-0.13229363281030793	-0.09213567030995984	-0.04981592135007261	0.03008961695890504	0.04125040092252505	0.05694077697145052	0.11052223923304208	0.14081398190083458	0.33170761965983764	0.3574871369611355	0.4825087336934575	0.953998455714861	1.0519579319858343	2.120343983322991	
I hate football!! I hate football fans! I hate cars! but this film was the funniest thing I have seen in quite some time. <br /><br />I was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend, and all I have to say is I laughed till I cried, and when is it going to be available in the UK and Denmark. Girls, this is one football film you will need to see, its hilarious!<br /><br />The fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing, the guys may not be well known actors, but this is good down to earth real humour, with real people, and I for one applaud them for taking this to the screen.<br /><br />WELL DONE!	-4.090323194197213	-2.011671892565373	-1.305201464086962	-1.304260457741718	-1.086802020786297	-0.5612866942344521	-0.3006018220360933	-0.18623077553199832	-0.11153426453039281	0.05002799880146894	0.8641646169019864	0.9042464182187606	0.9392614317977379	0.9619256564118726	0.96244662876284	0.9943229917878876	1.0063716073973141	1.3965956213919735	1.458689950227189	1.5366871730413023	2.065715497001976	2.157580137504805	2.2134769967014813	2.412955391429022	3.879625105865841	
I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of crap. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever.<br /><br />The American cop has a German accent! The "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign "Police Station" hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about TEN FEET.<br /><br />This cop pulls women over, cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag. The cop partner thinks maybe something is not right, that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women, but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because - he's a moron! The dialog is totally stupid, the acting is awful, and the characters act in the stupidest manner I have ever seen on screen. It is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, and yet, the partner, who is there all along, doesn't know what is happening! <br /><br />The director of this film is a total hack. I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. It has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever started to watch and I won't waste anymore time on it writing this review. <br /><br />Absolutely WORTHLESS.	-9.135630625959585	-4.3373500326787235	-4.287762815365251	-4.181800506555669	-4.181083334860182	-2.443486343561251	-1.1506029949961654	-1.1201954888491277	-1.099103733391054	-1.0586692141227705	-0.889062999206925	-0.5193856006549434	-0.24794308331831588	0.055822878009582466	0.1789084052269238	0.2813493237688462	0.6601198831906381	0.8099908299086694	1.3703316834105845	1.7142946339642757	1.7146836498293399	1.9236256251409034	3.4338928668697974	4.929971829173216	9.579216163020167

Let's cut a long story short. I loved every minute of it. A lavish fantasy in true Arabian-Nights style. There's an evil magician, a pretty princess, a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic. Only quibble: the special effects are pretty dated (loved Sabu with the djinn's foot, though!)	-1.610476996873629	-1.377237193619711	-1.1108410112196658	-0.3886541945845406	-0.38072713072055114	-0.1645560439477881	-0.018674578767633745	-0.0061842545400217774	0.06592361174976127	0.06729888229982958	0.0810142689785161	0.09542153788099869	0.09748535012986198	0.28416469490859975	0.32112785152116924	0.37211325897840886	0.378313917210443	0.44393549895084333	0.4480998378392779	0.591587078918606	0.6123430944415907	0.8469558614718007	1.1669931337286652	1.3431380621062288	1.7553863319713288	
"House Of Games" is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head. "House Of Games" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. Of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate. So it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on, even though we think that we do. But that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities.<br /><br />It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it. The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort "Marnie", considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Master's more thought-provoking works. One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouse's character being the same as Tippi Hedrin's...ten year later perhaps. Both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouse's repressed, up-tight character says, "What's life without adventure?" Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!	-3.709327764525	-2.255364357878053	-2.238743823122919	-1.5861620142034005	-1.2444700250860015	-1.1199097438668815	-0.9675376338760272	-0.49761186168056254	-0.4055048345214562	-0.20452310923124778	-0.13093306193035828	-0.04273266621590141	-0.03494139739299683	0.21814839210963113	0.2575935324120638	0.46065291261452335	0.48217068447229505	0.564497283612291	0.7026721021800426	0.7630431499499625	0.8354781992840093	0.8978092459482371	1.1894076118304	2.5635522118130494	4.672843427019793

I saw this film at a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.<br /><br />Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror film.<br /><br />If the audience wasn't scared, it seems the filmmakers were. They delayed release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as I can tell, they hadn't. It was the same lousy movie, just a year older.<br /><br />It almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good," but it's slow-paced and boring.	-4.23313488235305	-1.8164877576802936	-1.7730895780209672	-1.7549180404169615	-1.6543586454272288	-1.1596944286896935	-0.7298563098998753	-0.36673636590701003	-0.3401396941604737	-0.3191341128307888	-0.24265673356496878	-0.016705272847566014	-0.004662535399936253	0.047172960264990654	0.10991508449645197	0.32417804317349264	0.37996352994187904	0.3938798068710264	0.39944635764020836	0.4274755350021482	0.5119381774497996	0.6686735260697989	1.5976097115016135	2.218828255162756	4.482353824824104	
Sorry everyone,,, I know this is supposed to be an "art" film,, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch. Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a sound track was brutal. The loooonnnnng shots were too long. How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. I really had a hard time just getting through this film. The performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, uninspired, stuff can you take? The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman. And i'm no fan f his either. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is,, well, lying.	-5.61416861298025	-2.1961873010573822	-1.8924777776088624	-1.7996274837305442	-1.7286115821103654	-1.5044693473890678	-1.4934537154428849	-1.469836480619315	-0.5612668912829588	-0.35149249761008594	-0.10052538271324915	0.027753258365675187	0.1740195457230184	0.28470165000945274	0.33508871701878107	0.34862746960934476	0.5037379164076021	0.5516490262564032	0.5983966088092728	0.7625647570733282	0.8454773486909128	0.8586837531336647	2.3652709361925135	2.405875232399804	6.2511727160290365	
You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly, the jokes are either cliché or boring. If they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us "laugh", they are throwing various props around the room. I really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.	-4.808132756756087	-1.9688453567989932	-1.804084299740489	-1.7283384115525973	-1.665940571059331	-1.4676695825272041	-1.4297083219462476	-1.0034953913926032	-0.33916494825338545	-0.2677217068771922	-0.07404197835203272	0.055070429548559896	0.0738666734570263	0.20045219184126611	0.216475982827281	0.22970824464420622	0.2593622435574044	0.4383340197067838	0.45531020071040784	0.4702061679420334	0.5307412003011698	0.666200535051383	2.016736064065991	2.362858360386743	5.090526180629044	
I just saw "A Tale of Two Sisters" last night and really enjoyed it. I've been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from South Korea. There aren't many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film, but the director does maintain the off-kilter and foreboding mood very well, especially in the awkward character interactions with each other. Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone's "there's something under the bed" fears from when they were a child, but in this case, it's the closet and the sink. I also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make-up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you.<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE TWISTS OF THE MOVIE REVEALED) I was following the story pretty well, but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part. However, I think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together. The film is very much like "The Machinist" in the way two of the character's joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions.<br /><br />Here's my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of Su-Mi or the actual ghost of Su-Yeon that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother that we see is, in my opinion a delusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she first appears in the film when she's wearing the gray pantsuit. I believe it's the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn't appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house. The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?) That explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother's brother looks at her like she's crazy and doesn't remember anything that she recounts. I think it was Su-Mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make-up in the mirror, which is revealed later to actually be Su-Mi wiping her make-up in the mirror.<br /><br />I think the ghosts in the house aren't entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon or the mother or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed the Su-Yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Also, it's the hairpin that Su-Yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink.<br /><br />The real stepmother, in the end, gets punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death, while Su-Mi unintentionally played a supporting role.<br /><br />I wonder if the "mother" that Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, is a ghost already. Perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet. That's left ambiguous.<br /><br />Other things that are suggested, but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother, at some point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too. It's not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself. It's also suggested that the mother had mental issues too, requiring a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi, you're beginning to take after your mother. I don't think she meant just physically.<br /><br />Also, if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually Su-Mi, then there's the suggestion of incest too, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi freaks out and shouts, "Don't touch me" each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes? Is that the "filthy things that you've done" that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting in it's capacity for different interpretations. A few of the scenes, however, were kind of derivative, such as the woman in the black crawling around scene, which reminded me of the herky-jerky movements of Kayako in the Ju-On/The Grudge films. Also, the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of The Ring. Furthermore, just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others".<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (that's already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can't be good too. One remake that I'm really excited about is "Dark Water" coming out this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my to-see list.	-12.946758931555287	-7.362243377531101	-6.1518187537201685	-5.621049156921484	-4.222385728779845	-3.9088472749190735	-3.5679296718486952	-2.0151991591453973	-1.0615837976131115	-0.9621175142546545	-0.454264027074893	-0.24747433282320525	0.1486751574812415	0.9139958525937871	1.2386660536900256	1.2610574680620057	2.1041800981159295	2.2934042375067016	2.4424960703797938	2.6374068707586362	2.699467042304545	4.297476657087912	5.0671175300545395	8.986294030155785	18.246550274029822	
I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are quite as bad as When Women Had Tails. It's a stinker of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like high art. And there's just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together. It seems to drag on and on and on.<br /><br />Well, you may be asking yourself, "If it's as bad as you say, why haven't you rated it lower than a 3/10?" Good question! And I've got two answers. First, the movie is not without its curiosity value. I do find a bit of interest in an Italian spoof of movies like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. I'll give When Women Had Tails a point for its historic "value". The other two points are for the mere presence of Senta Berger. I know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating, but what are you going to do? It's the best I can come up with.	-6.583227521067988	-5.569198833702995	-3.6788425294217504	-3.1760714878262504	-2.7899490399403373	-2.6490858013504077	-1.8127905938749682	-0.6582780048374548	-0.5983422293694134	-0.36144239565397995	-0.22957131937743208	0.19417061671035873	0.26354815333139037	0.309377427745848	0.36905173343075737	0.48718755247707535	0.5265363512467645	0.6642729059978308	1.0117173101876398	1.227406487525875	1.8283295903156913	2.326862743521898	2.5280039425268477	4.061932445353385	8.537879364410921	
I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence.<br /><br />And so it was for "Christmas in Connecticut" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas. It does, however, have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. To begin, the plot concerns a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess, married with a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single, lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking. Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwyck's restaurateur friend (S.Z.Sakall) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut at a farm belonging to Stanwyck's boorish boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all. Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married. Regardless, they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind.<br /><br />At this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd, not funny ha,ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did. The good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after.<br /><br />I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness it was set at Christmas or like 95 percent of Stanwyck's movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew.	-6.63344490396279	-4.1752709154575784	-4.096406738741459	-3.4382489548310913	-3.388347480714819	-1.6412203260276206	-1.3166465170897932	-0.5892309121008574	-0.5528620404207685	-0.4852296950522703	-0.2936836481906272	-0.13562837881985684	-0.10309152869884206	9.861850903538083E-4	0.036259895234056164	0.6189829380515021	0.63223199509853	0.7057225091343572	0.9538171607869161	1.186380269651425	1.4616048824703942	1.5694771462132475	1.8604751398954633	4.7309260736539285	8.668773578446528	
The only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself. I usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie I don't know much about. It's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain tile, because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast, you don't get an idea of what to expect. I read the review before watching this title and I don't know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even when the material was not the greatest. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable. It isn't one of the great all-time classics, but a pleasant and funny diversion-much more than you can hope for in most newer movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.	-2.133354244772849	-1.6896662517601126	-1.3678953323169438	-1.2856631223200294	-0.6488928575574633	-0.6401354097413805	-0.5528590939473184	-0.518142987030141	-0.48012630265775647	0.08681320439980575	0.12758265478303968	0.1875859280382195	0.19883808136616513	0.2635839787150272	0.2775802780755673	0.2916320005708468	0.32961247335183724	0.3336394001788823	0.44433995266495807	0.6510430145734585	0.6609038104281838	0.8036447335365378	2.0837084377027106	2.198821103523366	3.683161712700037	
This film set the standard for African-American film excellence when it was made. I heard on various stories on the film through time, that there was a push for an Academy Award nomination when it was released. This film plays on various emotions, and you definitely feel for all of the characters. Sure, some of the acting is a little wooden, but fortunately, those parts aren't pivotal. The music is sensational, and if you don't think the ending is a tear-jerker, you have no heart in your chest. If you watch "Cooley High", you will see that many, many films have copied various elements from it in order to strengthen their own films. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".	-1.4524442272568914	-1.1538228861979776	-0.9471750451918881	-0.9418679906776029	-0.4965773312423474	-0.384880104338819	-0.2999023428315503	-0.29449206762636887	-0.2000734461783173	-0.11810936306752906	-0.06925865996106648	-0.04917068128905702	-0.03616625618527502	0.00122319046049061	0.012568750198620901	0.061847083249419635	0.19424432042953194	0.2182852629727103	0.2865114729776402	0.4056611877523402	0.7648630341724758	1.153068751767675	1.1737497485879003	1.523646580266202	2.1851785245832653	
Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I've ever bore witness too. It's bad enough I wasted $3 to watch this crummy pile of crap, but it's the hour and a half time I lost that I could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. Getting drunk couldn't even help this video.<br /><br />To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe I actually lost a few IQ points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind-numbing "work"! Perhaps I should have followed my own advice this time. Never expect a decent film if it's written, directed and produced by the same person, and never EVER expect anything of value from Jeff Fahey.	-4.030260031987398	-2.351754458016049	-2.2653144331420165	-2.085602526819191	-1.7210974130956667	-0.7841042532255124	-0.72110785548498	-0.5962826858498247	-0.5089973982637067	-0.45717030399202974	-0.34285701969696347	-0.2846428865899172	-0.20602537900273193	-0.17690640978554623	0.15580039398924259	0.158165731667155	0.16466015548392077	0.25456625632166924	0.27110084160014136	0.36727603243877927	0.6140721372712027	0.6813263622238578	1.5193889778466614	2.0418219115454885	3.9627936726799846	
"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many '50s movies about hot-rodding teens encountering the supernatural. In this case, the teens can't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted. With nowhere else to go, they decide on an apparently haunted house. As you may have guessed, once they arrive, some weird things start happening. And there's a twist at the end.<br /><br />There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's nice entertainment nonetheless. My favorite character was the foul-mouthed parrot. Well, let me rephrase that: he didn't talk like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird. The movie's pure hokum, but harmless.	-2.926862397939369	-1.7125364058399715	-1.3976169416398065	-1.3870641014969107	-0.87376335041711	-0.7545132819510592	-0.7170348200965639	-0.4944876727087948	-0.48288901544325286	-0.4730980503994365	-0.12391427638339278	-0.011197033061199409	0.06734005727372093	0.2054512277134108	0.27729232564820183	0.2779976200005153	0.41736766549288107	0.42414114701832817	0.43746515873967934	0.5055087236829237	0.5379927516303251	0.9382602445485806	1.180441814286032	1.2764450480863732	3.341096663092819	
Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series wasn't that good. I think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and Daisy Duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted. The Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken Boss Hog was too cretinous to be evil and Rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment. It's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.<br /><br />Back to the movie. If you watch this film in it's own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the TV series, then it's not bad at all. The real star is of course the General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. is all about. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious Dumb-And-Dumber sort of way the TV series never achieved. The lovely Jessica Simpson is a natch as Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes a believably nasty Rosco P. Coltrane, the way he always should have been.<br /><br />If you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect. Otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind.	-2.5001829205422927	-2.2881712520531075	-1.9383199491930816	-1.8180258596302177	-1.7782674663284044	-1.5177323669289242	-1.013087599829643	-0.6237382650399429	-0.4563775710627655	-0.2945981590734012	0.015270202883315279	0.045481916639181705	0.12007754948461824	0.14715103850081301	0.17598101863552196	0.247558323707553	0.5428674494015204	0.6913607327748293	0.9783557899403189	1.1489485721354762	1.5103200916806503	1.6739302837683723	2.8084737492754472	2.9921162062199533	4.53322967730834	
This this coming of age dramedy set in Chicago in the early 60's, we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives. The two central characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both of these boys have promising futures. Preach is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball. When they're not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends, or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls, they're skipping school, riding the trains through Chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends.<br /><br />Things go wrong when Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car. The police pursue them and they are arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But the two hoods are not, and vow to get revenge on Preach and Cochise, thinking they blamed the whole thing on them.<br /><br />This movie is very episodic, but it still works because thats what life is, a series of episodes. Some funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic, and the situations are all believable and relatable. Like Preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl, or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight, or dealing with a bratty younger sibling. But even when a situation isn't personally relatable, like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie, the sequence is still hilarious.<br /><br />'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' which aired on ABC from 1976-1979. Even though the show is most famous for the character Rerun, he is not in this film, nor is there any character remotely like him. The humor of that show was very broad, but still funny. The humor of 'Cooley High' is truer to life, and thus more entertaining.<br /><br />Additionally, the soundtrack is wonderful. Classic songs from that period by Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas, and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant tone of the film.	-3.8049286117584264	-3.186752131856855	-3.0077025508522937	-2.7201813345782346	-2.241329499631366	-1.5911045449650105	-0.8312587079320937	-0.6699328162733859	-0.3670672824924248	-0.2729796860413794	-0.055392244694439596	-0.03295648006066412	-0.01880521286714204	0.13030587357649043	0.7330474720575099	0.9927046498304174	1.1826116379027196	1.208991300055347	1.5269811743444257	2.010517472431285	2.203146948849693	2.6491666824827185	4.416494885101558	4.843557852373532	7.200482798476389

A by-the-numbers exorcism exercise with a disappointing non-allegiance and usage of the term 'blackwater.' The cinematography appears right out of basic cable MOW land which removes any semblance of swampy, murky atmosphere from the proceedings. In addition, there's not nearly enough gore, sex or attractive young things to satiate the majority of the film's targeted viewers. That being said, the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy olive-skinned presence. What else needs to be said about this non-winner? Don't rent unless you've got a thing for middle-aged adults bemoaning their past and rants with clichéd priests, shrinks, hispanic stablemen all regretting their past actions.	-2.6478794777007253	-1.2000851945193036	-1.1850196683785668	-1.1816197987493666	-1.1149217440920987	-0.9537528464633876	-0.903786138979775	-0.2788426321767769	-0.24194688116654528	-0.2415787265422666	-0.14591940554051913	-0.021507873318330404	0.13642695741980024	0.14300785095104837	0.16765467075480556	0.20209234365485534	0.29442491855730357	0.3580480632935804	0.35950449888843444	0.45459707112106773	0.5106627003694956	0.7139905181242243	1.235765486616577	1.5092260354288891	3.130514554632324	
Here's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man.<br /><br />Certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.<br /><br />Take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. Upon discovery of the said corpse, the villains response? (bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all)  They resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!)<br /><br />However, I suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent Woody Strode (even if his screen time is very limited)<br /><br />Not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for Italian B-Movie enthusiasts.	-3.3756863651017124	-1.191065008520161	-1.1259826158322463	-1.1011776669540465	-1.061951709510773	-0.8822584729204406	-0.7856047136778859	-0.4784639334696183	-0.38298574112536077	-0.19992880968583268	-0.01314724780107486	0.0373738220921772	0.06469703425955299	0.14974812472467647	0.18773184718419644	0.21708937153961783	0.22268860407734578	0.2442775652279745	0.26662641769028483	0.36482285746302767	0.3939923967329443	0.6578197509677167	1.27554126530658	1.763507707322322	3.5787955587834333	
Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan's dream come true. At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life. A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored. It seems like a winning situation. And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this "esoteric dream" is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence. While it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project. And it is only a very few times.<br /><br />You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics. But then we start seeing new footage (alternates from Superman - The Movie for the trial) and that first bit of hesitation fades away. Hey, this is pretty neat! Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project, and it doesn't convince at all. And from this point on, it never ever lets up. It's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects, but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was "You'll Believe A Man Can Fly" it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here. The best effects in this are from the original productions.<br /><br />Another issue with this re-cut. A lot of it just doesn't make sense. The only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense. Lester's Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly. Part of this could be because Donner didn't get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible. What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.<br /><br />After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester. The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II. That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner. But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is re-edited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing. While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.<br /><br />So is there anything good in this release? Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that's neat to see. In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman - The Movie. But that only highlights the problems of this release. Any of the major scenes (really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando) would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section. Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances (many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used) sloppy edits and bad decisions.<br /><br />Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet. Why are we looking at Jackie Cooper's back as he calls for Lois and Clark? At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on? I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois. The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.<br /><br />Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts. It's just random action. Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates. They should have used more of Lester's footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.<br /><br />The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well. As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation "XK 10" while we all know it's the "XK 101"! A blind man in STM knows that! The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production. For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.<br /><br />The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states. As it is, we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a "Play All" option. It's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else. I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lester's version. It's by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief. He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new re-cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.	-16.936303476333745	-8.752899755840819	-8.548418589117945	-7.84031291147447	-5.948957307886007	-5.214076497294743	-5.097666245671139	-1.82145494537552	-1.043416517649176	-0.4293573590801732	-0.1824527989796309	-0.08677276349831292	1.0319345937582884	1.3380667582123702	1.528822683589942	1.7100029372567416	2.205395886660144	2.3220029142577574	3.4329087818143513	3.7559055796377123	4.041989255019536	4.234988811027002	6.385691015922712	10.949502444999363	23.016621981089482	
I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film. I managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead (which, by the way, is great fun).<br /><br />The story has massive holes in it. The plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at (looking daft and singing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet. Freeman and Timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sorts or something, which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that; though Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up.<br /><br />It would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion.<br /><br />Don't watch this film, it is a pure waste of time.	-5.181620924316609	-3.245431512584241	-3.1875326118292393	-2.743443916700989	-2.534628307797581	-1.0374393309507206	-0.8963026083989121	-0.8041338096408261	-0.7984003188887845	-0.43112477917957004	-0.23391873858174397	-0.15734040597438909	-0.15322863083071617	-0.10940169849198962	0.026165022673505792	0.15155373499656127	0.26564739954724614	0.393293818182291	0.43135818599131953	0.6323271710699631	0.989293271553224	1.0240017190933062	1.528884224686655	3.137061629516378	5.447404786411342	
This movie is based on a play, and is the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago. They have all met for a reunion. Terry Kinney plays James, a Junior High principal, and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role. Vincent D'Onofrio, as Phil, plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of "money" cockiness. Tony Shalhoub is George, the current Mayor of the town, and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown. Gary Sinise plays Tom, a writer, turned alcoholic, and in my opinion, is excellent in the role. While they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship, conflicts, jealousy, and fighting abound. As the men come to terms with what was, and is now, they are forced to look at their lives in a non-pleasant way. It's unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been, and I found it interesting watching them relate to each other. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's certainly good enough for a viewing.	-2.4267794087678527	-1.7825913255056494	-1.5482733452267898	-1.2855343340030576	-0.7114986675506108	-0.6324505422766848	-0.3478480826362928	-0.23057048031092753	-0.12755550698347262	-0.02682024217286407	0.07688280087301225	0.18255711624188165	0.2739402125224929	0.3266144766302834	0.3380014919900813	0.3557817848548984	0.4513167914227659	0.6861368649455533	0.690480060968055	0.7154019728966319	1.1982857523078352	1.4847788487097553	1.9632281945543602	2.6986174350199215	2.747304723524971	
i should love this movie . the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap .the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy . Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family . i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it.again the acting was very very good and worth watching . i really don't like the story line . just a personal preference .thank you	-1.902710611812093	-1.8024795846543626	-1.1400311017132816	-0.83702867490668	-0.6433984461808858	-0.41422080312030907	-0.12093972082222972	-0.0733799476167875	0.03722925441594084	0.04713182268314636	0.16826942438534573	0.20611925554129623	0.24707961349524887	0.27793615993719234	0.3277323728856901	0.34590743478965724	0.41388946442195673	0.50528319306005	0.5114477537694151	0.6358987569651946	0.8363227428673552	1.196764764523516	1.4181574301247837	1.6130514852474163	2.108581757673006	
While I can't say whether or not Larry Hama ever saw any of the old cartoons, I would think that writing said cartoons, file cards, and some of the comics would count for something.<br /><br />For fans of the old cartoon, this is pretty much a continuation of the same, except with a few new characters - and a more insane Cobra Commander.<br /><br />We still have all the old favorites too, but on a personal note, one thing that always irritated me was this "Duke in charge" stuff, when there are tons of other *officers* around instead.<br /><br />The battle sequences are similar to the old series as well; the main trick here seems to be the CGI. It's overall pretty good, if not a little over-the-top.	-2.5233819138854057	-1.2742704901897164	-1.166124673207077	-1.1399021888025735	-0.9651240901402041	-0.5883778510840326	-0.4891962796344641	-0.35103804412255357	-0.32970289797091773	-0.2888021530542535	-0.23359109991023064	-0.03161424219842082	-0.0046842997913099736	0.02049768627130069	0.06643193068975298	0.1649323848718175	0.2538715345073234	0.3547512701928018	0.4248756399942799	0.4382299366338054	0.4821008063258161	0.5221338655369797	0.601685719398518	1.4291235735464412	2.531600221516227	
Spoilers<br /><br />Wow, END OF THE WORLD is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience.<br /><br />Here is the full story: a scientist is getting messages from space (a la INDEPENDENCE DAY). The messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in China. He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages (and who's also sending out messages in space). He and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent. They visit it. Everything looks normal, including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent. So he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet. Once the alien get the special element, the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform. Lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens. Lee walks in the transporter and he's gone. The couple, looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world, decide to follow the aliens. Because earth is doomed, the couple doesn't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear. The last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding. The end.<br /><br />That's it. <br /><br />I've never seen such a dull movie in my life. It's the most underwhelming movie I've ever experienced. The scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen. They don't care about anything. They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide "what the heck, who needs earth anyway?" They don't even try to stop them or do something to make things better. This kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent. The actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces, so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work. I wasn't expecting much with this movie because it IS a Charles Band production, but I didn't expect it to be this bad.<br /><br />Christopher Lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, I'm sorry Chris but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly entertaining. END OF THE WORLD is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worst: it's beyond dull and inert, with NO entertainment value whatsoever.	-12.655961127537957	-6.025768390925403	-4.907153943707044	-4.73925214316708	-4.432570958986833	-4.238207958326189	-3.9283572123768673	-1.834075036995483	-1.4646250217764205	-1.081846701204193	-0.5116765624404103	0.06259821321598003	0.42274798210730485	0.6372297740118283	0.9838977547523009	1.1137520959513172	1.2414828773125635	1.5276901287946993	1.5384041894494147	1.7683960577972853	2.1236696424977604	2.2665444838168955	4.563816739254818	6.536847752642256	13.836217058218772	
Well it's been a long year and I'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) placed second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it didn't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since MMFF is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies.<br /><br />It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play out in the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film. Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio. She did a great job portraying Bikay, the younger sister of Duroy. I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres. I think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her.<br /><br />Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well. The scenery was made breathtaking even though I feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different.<br /><br />In terms of the story I feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film. I certainly won't be raving about the story of this film.	-4.184323831859005	-3.452705528926187	-2.234709820826775	-1.7009690304337373	-1.6252611938220782	-0.5591878179191	-0.506167349544889	-0.19439424869324384	0.10582456025210099	0.42872090410821406	0.4990597451890566	0.7647938179601611	0.817708042314982	0.8681588118663793	0.8901388561727489	1.0421085471486	1.075029055027756	1.080954833619462	1.1719979140905614	1.2133993346054819	1.6336563253802214	2.1840006622060972	3.3085164241100005	3.4188200264543234	4.782203596498754	
..IT'S THIS ONE! Very cool premise, right off the bat.<br /><br />Has an excellent first scene, gotta give credit where credit's due.<br /><br />Has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me: Whenever the ghosts appeared, which I really liked by the way; how it was done, how it looked...the only thing was the ghost's relationship. Because of the way things went down in the first scene you'd think their dynamic would be different.<br /><br />Things slowed down a little too much in the middle I felt, and the crab/spider scene was just not good. BUT then the ending is actually very good! Sure, 'The Grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai's and that's what I liked about this movie comparatively.<br /><br />Please, someone one with a tempered style remake this movie.<br /><br />Fans of 'Silent Rage' would absolutely love this movie.	-2.7997418282507684	-1.603427054302971	-1.5657245716066384	-1.4567368498315303	-1.094186997540713	-0.9877442821825351	-0.6694269282309953	-0.3548851624380402	-0.2746295307124789	0.06883696431362983	0.17705541575085662	0.5496401526495308	0.5680343653063314	0.6234218205546769	0.6245700660457648	0.6495479606072418	0.8289078419152852	0.9541882536573334	1.0437836612743563	1.1067927965264357	1.2027028939487217	1.3486179038393773	1.9517512760324762	2.0084682933568487	2.411913398771101	
This movie was an excellent acted, excellent directed and overall had an excellent story. Ive had real life experiance with a boy like 'Radio'. At the football program in my town, weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice, travel, and have fun with the football team. This movie is really true and i can identify with it 100%. A boy like 'Radio' just needs to feel like they belong to something; they need to feel like their life is worth living. Thats how 'Radio' feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school. This is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen. My dad and I loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man!	-4.101931281616194	-1.8246666772135929	-1.4594658656874717	-1.2110800944262552	-1.0949325013594227	-0.6067895690121602	-0.2773707978243694	-0.11967329001923323	-0.041999792878060105	0.22389216245574967	0.4434052724533317	0.7886750490977599	0.8218045192231153	1.0334354298601907	1.165463780281887	1.625236921737896	1.6255360634155847	1.6717853550051593	1.7131787829972887	1.7306284880629241	1.7498740623967115	1.8717017137085166	2.4165382472145644	2.7557057532255014	3.8229086263146455	
Normally, I have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to get it off my chest.<br /><br />You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet... well, this movie was just terrible. It is nigh on impossible to "suspend disbelief"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it but Justin Timberlake just wouldn't let me. <br /><br />Timberlake should stick to music, what a dreadful performance - NO presence as an actor,NO character. Can't blame everything on Justin: The movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing; its definitely an "F".<br /><br />After seeing this, I have to wonder what really motivates actors. I mean, surely Morgan actually read the script before taking the part. Did he not see how poor it was? What then could motivate him to take the part? Money? Of course, acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work. <br /><br />LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets a lot more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the audience goes: "What the hell is going on here?

It's a very good movie, not only for the fans of Lady Death comics, but also for those who like animated movies/series of adventure and fantasy.<br /><br />The film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn't done, but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer himself.<br /><br />Then she seeks revenge...and the rest you better see it from the movie.<br /><br />I liked the movie a lot, the characters are like the original comics, form Chaos. I never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics, only the last ones, after the passages in the movie, so I cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics, but...one way or another it's the story of Lady Death!	-1.3979137833126891	-0.9416234373294173	-0.8431102842890934	-0.5114503545428596	-0.4149807336385828	-0.277471291561413	-0.2751816998080601	-0.21056034817036923	-0.11444896422586967	0.03974531869386899	0.046561029801221454	0.04819601868437799	0.056429754249494035	0.1891886778931705	0.3017190745561265	0.3564860096235475	0.40157145078980283	0.4068151316087082	0.5949168261905106	0.6309021865432349	0.7433279486845953	0.7758015821480249	1.2675357227794768	1.3116542229374775	1.3514589167255564	
The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you, but then, as it diverges more and more from the book, taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches, it becomes boring. Still, from comments I've heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it, and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (I love to Laugh). Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny.	-1.4878859878637136	-0.8824489928327193	-0.8330902921090563	-0.6729104393005502	-0.5136732287357907	-0.4972409526097247	-0.41239804842692634	-0.05906797305948548	-0.05364033158731446	-0.045749082651531034	-0.03358443870182454	-0.02740471051147387	-0.02111975110766299	0.012053655425448354	0.04251164281045278	0.1533815970870401	0.19468833980673034	0.24392413683245895	0.24597435164149276	0.2824193128471435	0.3300481739748661	0.3762384195238958	0.4518776208065385	1.0433594100101968	1.8806124751189612	
Aunt Cora had always been tactless, and her well-bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He WAS murdered, wasn't he?". They remembered it the next day, when Cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet...<br /><br />For some reason, the POIROT movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book. I was disappointed about the changes made in CARDS ON THE TABLE-- my favourite Poirot book. AFTER THE FUNERAL is my 2nd favourite Poirot book, and I was scared the story would be destroyed. It wasn't! The movie was nearly page-for-page faithful throughout, right down to the killer's motive! All the actors were wonderful, but my favourite has got to be Monica Dolan, who gives a great performance as Miss Gilchrist, the companion to the late Aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot movie ever!	-2.854779298472168	-1.8657143050435048	-1.6116592755038348	-1.2458011185568967	-0.9351472519656014	-0.9281201917116041	-0.8787405956203195	-0.4034367099787556	-0.2952114605924845	-0.216148434306952	-0.10313052162733571	-0.040120459604227054	-0.012934406303696605	0.06735801627474419	0.07885122024449201	0.15206801328262515	0.2206775621001565	0.4277931859644779	0.47858511360539535	0.47976721390312005	0.6627384782884066	0.8806032488084246	1.0613376894419142	2.5136476918011255	3.69001012769787	
Without a doubt this is one of the worst films I've ever wasted money on! The plot is, erm sorry, did I say there was a plot? The scariest moment was when..., nope can't think of one! The best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was..., nope can't think of one for that either. You knew who the killer was right from the start. There was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her top off. This film should only be watched to get an idea of how NOT to make a horror movie!!!	-3.1278196944180086	-1.9926211393758484	-1.4875719519034916	-1.3546975741227798	-1.2766636497831352	-1.1073440517038133	-0.9741665945243886	-0.433643120084053	-0.19949440803447907	-0.09538632464112888	-0.059464978290739975	-0.04249290947107466	-0.01655177139093704	-4.235927687741142E-4	0.18649368476739456	0.2835232984295142	0.29256068410348546	0.40268626326112067	0.4152976971805037	0.416371390599179	0.7888532760852395	0.8364180755445196	1.6729752158762725	1.735843543428419	3.649415490435947	
Is this a bad movie?<br /><br />Of course, what were you expecting from a movie called "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"?<br /><br />It is a "BABES in BIKINI" movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise. Given, this is not "A ROOM WITH A VIEW" or "SCHINDLER'S LIST." If you wanted a film like "A Room With a View" then you would not be looking at Beach Babes from Beyond. But if you are looking for a good Babes in Bikini movie with almost no plot, this is the one for you. This flick delivers on what it promises and then some. It is pure 100% adolescent fun.<br /><br />There were lots of BABES in and out of bikinis. The movie was quite funny and great to watch. These were some of the most beautiful women I have ever seen on home video.<br /><br />Every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this. This is actually one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. So unashamedly, I say again...If you are going to watch only one "Babes in Bikini" movie, this is it.	-3.854007066506857	-2.565628898712596	-2.5449133865066798	-2.1644236558306447	-1.319400481271702	-1.1898749289865438	-1.025030254100208	-0.9208312291469252	-0.7571808616838278	-0.6347763679248345	0.05298393253148257	0.20324354632315972	0.28597497249830217	0.39471877380091236	0.44581125844316805	0.8122683524983549	0.8353692247704266	0.9724209309360362	1.2374599629112355	1.245896984606254	1.412906775036229	1.856254111892772	3.474896528892188	4.290174307713131	6.092699955090474	
Any film school student could made a film 1,000 times better than piece of garbage. As someone who had read the book, I expected even a straight re-telling of the book would make this a fair film. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond Woodward's narrative and make a great film.<br /><br />Well the director did go beyond Woodward's narrative. He added a hip Hispanic angel named Velasquez that was not in the book. He had Bob Woodward interview the dead Belushi in an exchange in the morgue. The film had all the insight of someone stoned on PCP staring at his navel.<br /><br />If this is a spoiler to you, you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made.	-2.900400366600286	-1.9895327717369133	-1.4909844904781884	-1.4670535825394084	-1.0809648104703595	-0.8455382115764136	-0.7948769557905535	-0.17630329179093757	-0.17236145287517865	-0.12005553751834193	-0.10814808972084067	0.02911527790586252	0.03995339153130766	0.1696713450618248	0.2958480364222355	0.32182859175893747	0.36858043097090293	0.5280964050462692	0.635034069118529	0.6541229571717616	0.7973675460179486	0.8645206081603798	1.3765753703812598	2.1219628678790228	4.006849681092131	
A beautiful postcard of New York. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear. It never did. My teenagers liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something. This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done. The ending came with a twist which we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.	-3.109829525721295	-2.7277138178060145	-1.471273013772279	-0.7567285511610535	-0.5771808272381727	-0.3716175149253327	-0.3328373499769384	0.07028868464939915	0.07855176043200204	0.1155684317391478	0.17126505592816854	0.22160802820980877	0.25881223054801034	0.4162516379660733	0.49199140894437965	0.547068676178492	0.6888965378204917	0.8828505502673322	0.9990271473521253	1.2371751064820273	1.421789242887754	1.6203114671235883	1.6300662174988978	2.407240352943491	3.283195964360632	
Filmed in Arizona by a mostly-foreign crew, "Nightkill" is one of the clumsiest crime dramas I have ever seen. Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) trails recently-widowed Jaclyn Smith around, hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husband's death. Jaclyn's wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and her dog is named "Cowboy"...seems as if somebody sure bought into the American myth that all westerners talk and dress like descendants of John Wayne! Screenplay by Joan Andre and John Case may have worked better if approached as parody; this mystery thriller just plays tame, with director Ted Post asleep at the controls. Don't be drawn in by the video box art of Jaclyn screaming while taking a shower. She does indeed take a shower in this film, but it is not revealing (nor does it further the murky plot one iota).

A very funny movie. It was good to see Jim Carrey back in top form. It was definitely worth the price of admission. Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film. I think they may have played the dog a bit too much however, still a good film to see.	-3.6671843986593804	-2.3905545175279315	-1.5107968454906398	-0.7893574844576025	-0.3897857956541044	-0.3666789937097577	-0.06398783610877194	-0.05268051331065303	0.16636457540676047	0.2864423648780797	0.299758335356484	0.44252740369676025	0.44935247218065844	0.604369581494668	0.7404221012688493	0.8095566317712641	0.814983874909244	0.9045511273473388	1.0053998918059952	1.1932781162504928	1.2100051053092429	1.524884059524717	1.673038872154764	2.9809280601366988	3.3396576347026827	
This is a VERY entertaining movie. A few of the reviews that I have read on this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort at serious drama. IT WAS NOT MADE THAT WAY....It is an extremely enjoyable film, performed in a tongue in cheek manner. All of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us. The fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous. The so-called "Green Death", utilized on a couple of occasions, is not, as I read in one review, "gruesome". A couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas near the end of the film. Hey, lighten up... Again, I remind one and all that this is a fun film. Each phase of this "fight" was captioned, which added to the fun aspect. The actors were not trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is NOT one of those martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the "bad guy" (Seas) is dealt with. I promise you that if you don't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner.	-4.919799514526757	-4.173541193501192	-2.4514383997098306	-1.9581650846778857	-1.5831544807630267	-0.42558122804268916	0.12570128208336306	0.1802719960435297	0.23889874710397102	0.5768194074697588	0.604785216558525	1.0749264088516681	1.1472444909655444	1.1824600261423437	1.2994123591175564	1.3355904984885718	1.3389390032215713	1.4486968615282079	1.9714528328953038	1.9839112579547966	2.0121300719444863	2.88615484937677	3.42357311263284	3.5486045721021497	5.993369481981912	
Remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. The boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. The boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. A corker of a concluding scene! A Message From Charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. A nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.	-1.975970514790664	-1.766132334238697	-1.4833419921812094	-1.3587793332726092	-0.6569025408210282	-0.40394776109202424	-0.3324753916782759	-0.3164878873860297	-0.2957658607798265	-0.13625308226131408	-0.040365665081994295	0.01684474036147033	0.07016900306441282	0.15318765211511154	0.15941750392562565	0.19836345833199512	0.2158115348565755	0.3361065482968948	0.35069313636305033	0.6717683891401202	0.8590774193922047	1.4102379386850732	1.5437238052050821	2.1561648816166334	3.4139731841973995	
I rented this movie from the library (it's hard to find for good reason) purely out of curiosity. I'm a huge Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is horrible, not because it strays from the original novel text, but because it strays without focus or intent. The scenes are ill-constructed and don't lead the viewer anywhere. What's with the hokey voice over of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely unbelievable as Esther Greenwood (or any 20 year old for that matter) partly due to casting (she was 32 during filming, the age Plath was when she DIED) and partly due to the fact that she can't act. Hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. The direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what's there, which isn't much. The only reason I'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn't an option. Sorry Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting.	-7.176819488818682	-3.280478394805913	-3.2787214892700374	-3.142587521113857	-3.0411567678821707	-1.7110662844111488	-0.892382590562969	-0.7609043189769649	-0.6862053679594164	-0.40051305884332516	-0.37366669100470834	-0.20342188520012178	-0.18329384338676807	-0.10275673270109076	0.21405648912762423	0.312739471696427	0.5174332816964027	0.5476485334134675	0.6212878480458184	0.9065184350471525	0.9645341382826577	1.415421823403108	2.8519972425054227	3.715821067773126	7.552361550519757	
I'm a big fan of films where people get conned, and House of Games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned' genre. In short, it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing what's happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen. The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it's still difficult to guess where it's going, and every twist comes off as a surprise. As mentioned, I'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler. She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.<br /><br />House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city. The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece. Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role. She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act. The way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. At times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film. Another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks, say. All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.	-4.233168217934037	-2.4083204327279977	-2.3299848575463185	-2.0748932647943126	-1.214313709937568	-0.6655803084292321	-0.4376078731017106	-0.052255038454464275	0.016711713024488123	0.2176888987079382	0.348009806244307	0.3549516761092586	0.4787469967392912	0.5045274376755342	0.9608432876808941	1.052414231892429	1.3625677391909297	1.461059392602256	1.740228916064202	1.792843168508789	1.803919136016356	2.155900761726506	3.6451967053814207	4.181191667333229	4.25939413212772	
"Happenstance" is the most New York-feeling Parisian film I've seen since "When the Cat's Away (Chacun cherche son chat). "<br /><br />A film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention Audrey Tatou is getting for "Amelie," its French title is more apt: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon (The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings)" as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives.<br /><br />Tatou's gamine-ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures, and because she's part of a large, multi-ethnic ensemble, so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters, especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me, and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that I wasn't sure if they were doing that or not. <br /><br />But I loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafés.<br /><br />The subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once.<br /><br />(originally written 12/8/2001)	-1.9156650915724323	-1.2553679548387655	-1.1165483068342488	-0.9337439420393572	-0.7637328954315706	-0.5896445244346475	-0.24841748198269853	-0.1934317187790322	-0.1708942658737275	-0.1650925861538063	-0.10041372868105353	-0.08154681623333729	-0.07332246361283909	-0.06681457545618646	-0.018147428708360593	0.04603637170054421	0.11106701580623138	0.36630169821901154	0.3948547734009375	0.45117124678904574	0.5985543533798613	0.6353002401824811	0.6489000244813786	1.1704355159052675	2.1547253304975293	
A Three Stooges short, this one featuring Shemp. Of all those involving Shemp I've seen, this is my favorite performance by him in a Stooges short. The basic plot is that Shemp must get married by 6 o'clock that very evening if he's to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will. So Shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected, that is until they learn of his inheritance money. Best bits here involve Shemp shaving, Shemp and Moe in a telephone booth and Larry on piano as accompaniment to Shemp's voice-training session. Also the sequence where Shemp is mistaken as Cousin Basil and its outcome proves hilarious.	-1.5183781420598632	-1.050841672230053	-0.8136396174939949	-0.7224557112768064	-0.6326019387814856	-0.5699735085497991	-0.4510911597886448	-0.4378379415675153	-0.3799935008623643	-0.2664838892448509	-0.17141613181589319	-0.1311599010026867	0.06770167815085269	0.07037734683472628	0.14657041243846258	0.15169918391638537	0.19639893827730978	0.324971713349299	0.34167596652938337	0.3908454643052873	0.6823002617867894	0.7070488930076054	0.9740519469271909	1.1211700233207205	2.60149016525536	
Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel Gélin) on a bus.The next day this man is murdered, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; an assassination will take place in London.The crooks kidnap the couple's son Hank (Christopher Olsen) making sure Ben won't reveal their plan to anybody.Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) is a very intense thriller.The acting is superb as it always is in Hitchcok's films.James Stewart is marvelous.Doris Day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well.The song Que Sera, Sera has an important part in the movie.This movie is a movie of many classic scenes.In the final scenes at the Albert Hall, done without dialogue, you can barely blink your eyes.This movie is fifty years old now.Time hasn't decreased its power in any way.	-0.6892274197396545	-0.4392715026082102	-0.38183414422620326	-0.3737754354257946	-0.3287144464172037	-0.192408413501218	-0.10186418896029624	-0.0848640098237807	-0.07733610709972769	-0.06247263923401751	-0.05492293823927516	-0.05296038362509914	-0.020067210079410557	-0.01861195227230503	-0.013699790919767498	0.06724269070469975	0.12275941458500401	0.1346499016877203	0.16769565008084142	0.17387033066886012	0.1766627163935483	0.19059028427375338	0.1977452090693453	0.3740071012687332	0.5750496709950403	
This is probably my favorite movie of all time. It is perfection in its storytelling. It will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through. You feel for Doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.	-1.478052751162108	-1.4129675397148604	-0.6891602247978759	-0.6623662323979628	-0.5628477135768599	-0.4620931162943622	-0.15525419162818527	-0.12020215160961767	-0.1145226946414794	0.0562169173534552	0.06096902007061057	0.1083144855505857	0.14095065177005672	0.20828717908211833	0.25332503630786374	0.3041414332966803	0.30808175376415425	0.5265274602312834	0.5588008429276244	0.6481295832263912	0.696533312867134	0.8017491898436758	1.245034936418178	1.4080364700238193	1.690429082551097	
A documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the "kagutaba."<br /><br />From the looks of it, the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months, even one that's going to be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! However, unlike movies like CLOVERFIELD, REC, and BLAIR WITCH, where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the shakiness, this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style. It has TV excerpts and interviews and the scares are very subtle, well, excluding the last 20 minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendously.<br /><br />And it works. The film is very engrossing and it makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: It makes you think. You have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when, in course of the film, these things start to intertwine one another. The film is also very slow moving, which, in this case, is a good thing. We, as the audience, get to absorb the details shown on screen, however subtle or blatant they are.<br /><br />Above all, it's a frightening little film. I'm a person who is scared of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who slashes away teenage victims so yes, the film gave me some nightmares. There are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch, including one closer in the end where it makes you go "What am I looking at?!" Well, it's better left unanswered. There are around ten reoccurring characters in here, all of which gave authentic performances in their roles.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered. The question "That's it?" went though my mind. It left a bad taste in my mouth. However, the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening. Don't see this alone in the dark because you'll regret that choice. Also, I can see in a couple of years that Hollywood would remake this film. That will be interesting.	-5.307895903815147	-4.6598948920974	-4.000317855358831	-3.165689669998466	-1.6613004913004785	-1.63158976505192	-1.3507123738757083	-0.42874806563730106	-0.37250136317288823	-0.2685628568569972	-0.21466064513030406	-0.167327928632013	0.09916264714038396	0.29474515994078565	0.30512695945192975	0.4513796080514012	0.6045124185604391	0.7244001874159421	0.7361617854217454	1.432640652643412	1.6245777636570125	2.7875903547593395	3.7032385789309985	4.41186197531397	8.51065948753574	
I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I, along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience, were vastly disappointed. The movie wasn't even so bad it was good; it was as lifeless as a snake-bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame. It reminded me of one of those cheesy SciFi movies, except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy. It all seemed worn, flat, and overtly formulaic. I'm shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it's a piece of s*it and plays along with it, but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense. It's the worst kind of lame movie: it's joyless.	-4.88516775150714	-3.109450199047253	-3.0644642735379715	-2.9362770522558983	-2.421013098029624	-1.453403979344161	-1.2379123261733924	-1.1354435406798118	-1.0360339269143382	-0.5444125570001824	-0.5301840522315907	-0.47158302521686324	-0.45470411334368316	-0.43206868856832387	-0.36955581677863336	-0.06341158241541063	0.23714462931033764	0.8867539639180382	0.944397809647345	1.0539227708931265	1.3926597168808048	1.6152210201773194	1.6531869354595488	3.4738028518230695	5.4266829524997	
I'm not a movie snob. I've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and I've hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with critics here--"Galaxina" is just substandard. Clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. "Galaxina" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard.<br /><br />"Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called "The Blue Star". After a long voyage (and some very unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at its destination, a sort of wild west alien world. There's a painfully unfunny cantina scene (clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous "Star Wars" scene), a chase involving space bikers, and a final getaway.<br /><br />The cast tries, but can't breathe life into this turkey. Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have done better work in other movies. James David Hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceship's crew. The late Dorothy Stratten stars as the robot of title, and while she looks great, her role doesn't give her much of a chance to act.<br /><br />You might catch this film to see Dorothy Stratten. However, if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to skip this one.	-6.023339908642749	-3.1749484663777983	-3.1697493928924727	-2.874104429607903	-2.679806753526724	-1.071165424665407	-0.9574983865300358	-0.8795182677123803	-0.7772721779333246	-0.7442620609804755	-0.5528833210314082	-0.5138370212993347	-0.19373073296920132	-0.010349966899218757	0.5450477353005219	0.5827742664653469	0.6661000307494244	0.8590032036576052	1.117770848257448	1.1565839638305002	1.1667250726671587	1.295283623605368	1.6079098819998174	3.5776365302705275	6.592364622348513

My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film, realized it was a Christian movie, and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that "Christian" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.<br /><br />To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. The cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. The film begins with an interesting premise - UFO abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie's two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the Rapture. At least the Frank Peretti-inspired "The Visitation" (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movie's premise. "Unidentified" ends nowhere even close to where it started, which is a huge letdown.<br /><br />As for the acting? The supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (Rebecca St. James plays a bit part and is passable.) For their part, a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. Sadly, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. The "protagonists" are anything but; you know it's bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the film to be the most annoying.<br /><br />A final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie, which will be of more interest to Christian than non-Christian readers. In a word, it is embarrassing. Other Christian films like Carmen's "The Champion" and Peretti's "The Hangman's Curse" have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. This film, by contrast, is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-Christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.<br /><br />I do believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and I applaud efforts to create good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a screening of a good Christian film, consider "Mercy Streets," the aforementioned "The Champion," or (if you're Pentecostal) Robert Duvall's provocative "The Apostle." <br /><br />As for "Unidentified?" Rent it if you must, but screen it before you show it to a non-Christian or a larger audience.	-8.702963730568296	-5.530386280070219	-4.161947355361904	-3.606750336712145	-3.5448928116884555	-2.6521977203043545	-1.9930198347221757	-0.8794560701819287	-0.7778491463650673	-0.7229863874144833	-0.5834235471982844	-0.5810878247115276	-0.4078324274860924	0.13887706151623952	0.17992384200708378	0.5324835267551002	1.1855045524718941	1.2401695090243667	1.3438146239846096	1.4370626128305715	2.17402464033126	2.3683656473337718	3.131202168308242	5.793050389010879	10.434330858185843	
In the European TV industry, movies like this one are called "stickers". TV stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let's say, Titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.<br /><br />14 Hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. Unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.<br /><br />Newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting. The actors are not believable in their roles: their lines, when spoken, sound way too memorized, as if this was a read-out camera test.	-3.8316098759258366	-2.1243777059694797	-1.9820166836069129	-1.8131230454987355	-1.6853904312632328	-0.9808623377375112	-0.8172119810569447	-0.7075848370233173	-0.6139223375580283	-0.5020350450956161	-0.44311856297147867	-0.3144480702695457	-0.14188417707827264	0.0181499441282649	0.04646411508855164	0.1238363636276727	0.5098989481684444	0.598835556424646	0.6150518736125115	0.6456948033059451	0.7052813013252959	0.9055448519636271	1.6121485992631965	2.037249054533234	3.816343354225958	
The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye punctured with a needle, and so forth.<br /><br />In the most nauseating scene, the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns. The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen, believing the series to contain actual murder, attempted to ban its distribution in the United States. An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers -- sick re-creations using nasty, but obvious special effects. Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comic-book artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms. But, gorehounds probably won't find anything special.	-4.435201646979597	-1.8368633275708806	-1.8193445993821733	-1.7911170940748102	-1.6139101353675307	-1.1759420278164248	-1.0942963328012008	-0.3590590843896858	-0.25338868464039926	-0.18214801004410996	-0.14970027117993337	-0.07818463020841748	-0.07553896381856948	0.1676237907474942	0.25940303952387933	0.271549496579646	0.30842359478494513	0.690646038378854	0.6935537687620943	0.7447876264921691	0.7476953216400124	0.8030185895223583	1.4929266632226694	2.3296595359783585	4.533147607517526	
The problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as "camp" (i.e., the 60's Batman show) for TV and movie. Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), a cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet (a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights), and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar statute. And when they're not doing booming Sousa march scores, the tinkly little "funny" music undercuts much of the drama.<br /><br />Even as such, this movie is...okay. It's fun, and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. Except for Monk, as has been mentioned before: he's hugely muscled, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf.<br /><br />The Green Death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something I'd recommend for children. But they are very close to the feel of the pulps. When the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right - I'll give them that.<br /><br />But if the producers had done Doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, Reeves' first two Superman movies, think what we might have had then. I think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic. There's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage, but they're also trying to give in to the "heroes must be camp" attitude that Batman created. One gets the impression there was a sober, pulp-style first draft and then someone came in and said, "Hey, let's make it funny - it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!"<br /><br />But Doc lives on, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch ain't doing a homage to Doc Savage in that movie, the man is truly demented. So when the series actually gets on TV (allegedly mid-season in '99-00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90's, will live once more.	-6.435061087974038	-3.7950163797156886	-3.235325341380558	-2.476034539580586	-2.131128895506105	-1.9075245203431728	-1.5702529180660671	-0.6233137563397682	-0.6152212934260327	-0.28902976599176905	-0.092385519140695	0.13738975602454168	0.1914730842450721	0.2745656215975697	0.29411031782869546	0.45097224809013353	0.9250837228035119	1.0567898889322966	1.1363697942355264	1.2449443278245327	1.6200764487401875	1.9351235871864438	2.2438114091413968	4.058266292976998	7.728771825863228	
This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie REALLY sucks! It is disguised as a "thinker's film" in the likes of Memento and other jewels like that, but at the end, and even after a few minutes, you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p. Probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is  I don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural, or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one, btw) with stupid "riddles", the kind you learn on elementary school recess, you suddenly come to the "one truth" about everything, then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! What? How, what, why, WHY? Is just like saying that to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients, and add water forgot about cooking it? I guess these guys forgot to, not explain, but present the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do that when you present a story which normal, everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people. Acting was horrible, with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera, and the guy from Highlanders, the series, acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah, they're all real though s-o-b's). The "menacing" atmosphere, with the "oh-so-clever" riddles (enter the 60's series of Batman and Robin, with guest appearance of The Riddle) and the crazies who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that smirk on their faces just horrible, HORRIBLE.<br /><br />I'm usually very partial about low budget movies, and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve, in lieu of their constrictions, you know, but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it.	-5.364395983839795	-2.9874397280221268	-2.8618792270601667	-2.6617394926424316	-2.643365563813885	-0.8455234030460987	-0.7315439113308397	-0.6310182456776718	-0.5612298011752763	-0.48190767314622146	-0.46430283431379205	-0.43176414013117664	-0.28854024357513475	-0.253587107285683	-0.19030158220777332	-0.17775307499690773	-0.022315341207925832	0.017693591391949093	0.5567702469577394	0.8028285808658842	1.2492907094997403	1.456182058864616	1.6198906455258602	3.131150978495417	5.604994162412475

Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made. The whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl, and all the attempts made to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills' careers managed to survive this is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about it was THERE WAS NO FOOTBALL IN IT AT ALL! Avoid this one if possible.	-1.9156518244142415	-1.0376307095284443	-0.8642513017668461	-0.8479627882937971	-0.7076095848086863	-0.47635668696969496	-0.2684488402683241	-0.21300442143658682	-0.1858362115753976	-0.15805175622812465	-0.15720727470280985	-0.12783170633611798	-0.0950093085281851	-0.0843697120244237	-0.036141670523159294	-0.006009543528226656	0.09761852070833457	0.11888801661500946	0.22732120549278964	0.2340725202202349	0.33740137075709214	0.4072819170099506	0.4742206119914041	0.828078350198457	1.7359464739676496	
If there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing. The premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about. However, there is not much tension, and Williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy.<br /><br />Collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production felt rushed and holes are apparent. It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better.<br /><br />One thing is certain: Taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.	-1.541531198885361	-1.3377868894896263	-1.1294099462641842	-1.0500876405024537	-0.6272512572059712	-0.38729068452718873	-0.3859631208859033	-0.2833139610306329	-0.2607084869224642	-0.1301105792749871	-0.06636565584317008	-0.021340162363594622	-0.01440536652254143	-1.824784981461075E-4	0.1260420948461395	0.2174958812754606	0.21782180437158094	0.34931440447441786	0.44188567429296	0.6901848294271513	0.8927570836941747	1.252133372167907	1.5203326403879227	1.5678787116626027	2.3986249326468507	
I really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas L'Engle brought out in her novel. We had read the novel in our English class and i absolutely loved it, i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason i gave it such a poor rating. Don't see this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle's texts because you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as was my case) then it is an alright movie!	-2.487236095154402	-1.2420411995102683	-1.2034866769147778	-1.1109648211499317	-1.1053579408704133	-1.0997521949038114	-0.8472026372924124	-0.18974876768893162	-0.18227153494262327	-0.07277575100622899	-0.050741081498964724	0.001322944226900935	0.0028129553045374844	0.023427547868331677	0.09286287967913462	0.12407868119587682	0.19843046916614127	0.44119092945148214	0.4711061691876791	0.5856497173616185	0.5869724559260011	0.6526757480153236	0.6542136370503422	1.662754020283434	3.27670253580703	
"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG-1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.<br /><br />Having seen this series sporadically for it's first few seasons when it first came out, I didn't know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premise.<br /><br />This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time restriction of film. The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.<br /><br />"Stargate SG-1" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: <br /><br />- The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goaul'd threat. <br /><br />- From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth. After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of Goaul'd/replicator/ori conflicts<br /><br />- The 8th season is probably the most mixed one. It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. <br /><br />- The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O'Neil. They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and human/Jaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.<br /><br />Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.<br /><br />Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.<br /><br />In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to find that it ends. The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG-1.	-3.7722470437654585	-3.348354463134383	-2.6180484695952755	-1.7097005012596371	-1.508581862327265	-1.3742871783883106	-1.102509089150685	-1.0595178095961924	-1.0519769496979938	-0.22890857426117714	0.06384562420271814	0.2809849662792561	0.3631191924059915	0.47255937477663984	0.7466227354560873	0.7698614545919895	1.079950799687575	1.122011195367303	1.6790406539606866	1.9019038814764413	3.472525417971934	3.541978101951286	4.010127755187775	4.66513063368007	7.111807578704731	
FLIGHT OF FURY takes the mantle of being the very WORST Steven Seagal flick I've ever seen...Up to now.<br /><br />It's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest, Seagal isn't really trying in this - he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more.<br /><br />The Co-stars fare no better, being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters.<br /><br />The Direction by Keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he's also responsible for another couple of Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) The screenplay Co-written by Seagal himself is laughably inept.<br /><br />According to IMDb $12M was spent on this boring load of old tosh - If these figures are correct I sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent.<br /><br />FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for shot remake of the Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which has to be better than this tripe.<br /><br />This has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever,Give it a MISS! 1/2 * out of *****	-4.020628046900913	-2.8091309389657404	-2.7625044573250728	-2.616973047729476	-2.5485897875800663	-1.37364535058663	-0.7698069994588884	-0.7336243455997472	-0.7096627690514715	-0.6013434100472459	-0.5504152424016038	-0.4868239571051448	-0.21388201607741625	-0.09866447329286698	0.38251792875581153	0.42647397805094683	0.4592699856689879	0.7870896882309755	0.799010927153414	0.9514165145202167	1.0592403030910422	1.0667697404356862	1.8920347767497852	2.7860608259776214	4.205197904160942	
Without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. On top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from "evidence" to "violence," I had the entire plot figured out. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste any money. I would truly be angry if I had paid to see it in a theatre.<br /><br />Anyone that labels this thing a thriller really needs to get out more. An awful, awful film in every way that matters.	-6.758901605955666	-4.078513036611658	-3.944942172875184	-3.7270778554598625	-3.097486874214651	-1.8498989736343272	-1.6547862325534632	-1.219090336993639	-0.8002004366798932	-0.5249669871186907	-0.29561084635396495	-0.27749537906499266	-0.16250789297268137	-0.1396476569801146	-0.08250328271720218	-0.04992883609652837	-0.020174407133959626	0.52437001177371	0.7847594910916237	0.8389861238199708	0.9186726114807608	1.1793613633469782	2.9422511976550396	4.032079272922446	6.824734135801643	
I'm basing this on my observations of one episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I don't think I'll be watching again. The acting was totally wooden, the plot completely predictable, the ending totally unrealistic -- I mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was!! I fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor, but they can surely find better writers. Maybe they are outsourcing the writing to India or China!! I'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season!	-3.251431953395851	-1.7364350509234516	-1.6866356516641134	-1.6220783541470642	-1.4647390269723368	-0.8386582820261248	-0.7755449961807108	-0.6846475242509934	-0.4186417400427114	-0.3587875136913297	-0.3068665863644992	-0.3026922836196736	-0.15540966522767508	0.0751126366661726	0.20680759664847842	0.35502373856263836	0.3699508694372025	0.3743693854246553	0.41381469046862907	0.4874952957198964	0.7117621124165279	0.838616673859297	1.120986902499661	2.2290249722735958	3.7420760365348387	
And that's how the greatest comedy of TV started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season. Because that's where "Friends" is based: on quotes. Extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts: Let's say a big thanks to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the "perfect guy" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... ENJOY FRIENDS!	-1.3359188365129648	-1.2940267597472135	-1.0809850851189853	-0.9995374364414298	-0.5946840409054899	-0.44413204748829654	-0.33676075949474	-0.2819770257505408	-0.22073175117007163	-0.199354301025687	-0.1615940445363016	-0.1435216074580242	-0.02381661107244995	0.009563379180938608	0.03465021892870324	0.2478258938308869	0.26103078121938544	0.2618134937864739	0.6763218855028543	0.7495555201547663	0.7627551991077277	0.9009496342123048	1.454209994685323	1.5119262388692372	1.6463187446582916	
If Fassbinder has made a worse film, I sure don't want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this, to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like "The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant". This film bogs down with so much arty, quasi-symbolic images it looks like a parody of an "art-film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elvira's prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance. But what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just Elvira and her ex-wife and/or her daughter. These are the only moments that display any real human emotion, and prove that at the core of this horrible film, there was an excellent film struggling to free itself. What a waste.	-4.463148398550855	-2.279776796716057	-2.094140348454873	-1.9020668566234462	-1.780047639710274	-1.5932172570856644	-1.2660511188876833	-0.6744608661614275	-0.3989451047326002	-0.3620097364639669	-0.3347360290343726	-0.09264689830276168	-0.007627900478031899	0.10227461144993741	0.10721152097893918	0.19526151055894636	0.27830886264296506	0.5064707692036761	0.5197958112332292	0.5610148984362474	0.6417506714659365	0.8074031693878413	1.3544448137151892	2.5381171701640106	4.625625382309956	
This movie narrate the story of John Belushi,based of his biography `Wired' , wrote by Bob Woodward.All of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of John Belushi we see one angel accompany Belushi during few points of his life.Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of Belushi ,and his play stay only a pale animation.The director,on more,not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused. But the worse is that they have featured Bob Woodward that spoke with Belushi before he died. For this negative points the movie is only a would-be attempt to narrate the controversial story of John Belushi. My rate is 4.	-2.2686895557358717	-1.5236869240329871	-1.5097570921963104	-1.1626874970806433	-1.0876426387025209	-0.9769404871200085	-0.5656200938500892	-0.5385826503574892	-0.3955919479446962	-0.3001840378465831	-0.26446582489746845	-0.20605481327572114	-0.1657561379618402	-0.009615375287848033	0.039286193422201174	0.17613719766166014	0.17813018537664088	0.18055495702876406	0.2210425991027042	0.25183074589097737	0.3874213218391867	0.42919866359312675	0.9250020269216614	1.3258976575980175	2.276670612614164	
I wait for each new episode, each re-run with anticipation! The new look of sci-fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end. To combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. Season #9 should be a thrill in itself. I wish that Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season, as I love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake. Also, you need a bigger role for the Asgard - they are just too cool.	-2.7966949762847264	-1.963086436994868	-1.4331965121444272	-1.227023209513642	-0.9400973465643284	-0.45323279571066405	-0.11107797648481885	-0.10095341237523459	-0.055495748746402174	0.2363610890647606	0.26238514975573396	0.3312011932466068	0.3319578561723687	0.36350044258480463	0.3926718609558538	0.4155824055635452	0.5465080881317366	0.7809692452051294	0.8450474779688497	0.9054479222844611	1.0451969327307356	1.1237172966949327	2.254688036878245	2.2778368884274385	2.7343191934577953	
I think that it's great how Chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation. Film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed, they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now. MONSTERS is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining. It takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it's own horror series. This particular series was not as horrifying as the Friday The 13th, The Series, nor as adult oriented as the Freddy's Nightmares..it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time. I am happy the Chiller Channel shows it in their line-up, I am just about caught up on the episodes I missed when I was growing up.	-1.7722832296771165	-1.3581672897631991	-0.9625369799028471	-0.7064202302756261	-0.6121950300659659	-0.604111534152985	-0.213223921713194	-0.19466705653500305	-0.11616026985466354	-0.07714992178609203	-0.07657173863304237	0.07702435664295665	0.10285278978569987	0.11895688323601628	0.27649399738314356	0.31377588031513326	0.4872112732754416	0.49025283991398894	0.5187199130314303	0.6578204524811954	1.0975778515942893	1.2018104713783353	1.3073879523078862	1.388875588022593	1.6460995131541396	
Plenty has been written about Mamet's "The House of Games"; most of it good. I decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after 17 years and was surprised at how much I enjoyed viewing it again. The film's success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us, the audience, and the mark simultaneously. Then he explains the art of conning only to do it again, etc. all the while building the story. "The House of Games", now a freebie on cable, is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for Mamet fans.

Adapting his own novel "Cabal" for the screen, author / screenwriter / director Clive Barker fashioned this marvelous story of outré horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer. The cops gun him down in front of Midian, on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society. When they lay claim to Boone and make him one of their own, this causes repercussions for everybody, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (the very cute Anne Bobby) and dubious psychiatrist (a most enjoyable David Cronenberg).<br /><br />"Nightbreed" displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that I don't see in movies all that often. For one thing, Ralph McQuarrie, an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three "Star Wars" entries, helps Barker to create excellent visuals for "Nightbreed", starting right away with the opening credit sequence. The visual and makeup effects are elaborate, and production design and cinematography quite impressive. Barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters. It's colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in. And of course there's the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions.<br /><br />Great supporting performances add to the fun. Cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a fine love-to-hate-him type of antagonist, a rather nasty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary Lylesberg, and is solid as a rock. Hugh Ross is great fun as Narcisse, as is Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as an added bonus, she bares her breasts in one sequence). Simon Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two "Hellraiser" pictures, turns up here as well. There's even a cool cameo by 50's and 60's sci-fi star John Agar.<br /><br />Danny Elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores, and Barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown.<br /><br />"Nightbreed" is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn't seen it. I give it a hearty recommendation.<br /><br />9/10	-8.338804718874336	-5.033589101771439	-2.724977662426606	-2.6173777161558287	-2.0847534547086655	-1.1024292083972416	-0.4532065980734785	0.6594893186776827	0.8804090047682402	0.8863982805338769	1.3952653118853036	1.4566222688184716	1.5691379581911435	1.719722537099319	1.8217672883638312	1.9338417979799476	2.0386247936517825	2.423595216546288	2.700733198686369	2.8009497381992063	3.2818929326183515	4.281829664812067	4.326031769931428	4.760636005828696	8.330689592265207	
OK, I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18, I must admit: I really hated it.<br /><br />We watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who whimpered at the very words "Watership Down"- their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it. To be honest, I wish I hadn't bothered. I gave it the benefit of the doubt; generally I don't like to stop watching a film half way through. This was an exception. It was really, really, excruciatingly, sickeningly dull. This film was possibly the slowest thing I've ever watched (imagine a doped-up snail in space), and really didn't "do it" for me. The art was alright; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee, yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area. Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across. For me, I kind of wished that they would get gassed, not because I'm a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, dull and generally quite rude (oh I'm so terribly English). I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax.<br /><br />If I were to praise it in any way, I'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well-meaning. Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy, but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature. The musical score was not bad, too.<br /><br />So, to conclude, this film is pretty poor. I couldn't watch it the whole way through, or I'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom. Granted, it isn't "Torque" bad, but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes, so I've given it a 2/10.<br /><br />Hope this helps.	-8.75079590305199	-4.391752050482157	-4.367835333737859	-4.120122984967765	-4.0225659009933965	-2.2256509032371494	-1.5326669654127716	-1.0165047840276444	-0.7620312678427247	-0.6663592742946591	-0.6232134083103984	-0.4632388978622813	-0.3102464361288935	-0.22741776245627246	0.216280748810919	0.3042138869702857	0.3428917278337527	0.5266551487963231	1.1282417850372044	1.6073040365801197	2.243765357122105	2.309102504503553	2.3143242259558705	5.007941302330133	9.76566482803905	
When I saw this on TV I was nervous...whats if they messed it up? Millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man, in my case my Dad, would be let down. I watched it with my Mum and we both ended up crying, it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury. The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints, my Mums told me she hasn't been able to stop thinking about it. I hope this program made many people aware of what it's like living with brain damage and what it's like for the families. More programs like this should be made, I was surprised at how good it was and it's really shook me up emotionally.	-1.2581625466433795	-0.8700548948555887	-0.7245369445200984	-0.6806707872597502	-0.522739488205703	-0.4344537864476255	-0.34796230523739435	-0.1633400197555255	-0.1463553834226788	-0.10557262490461936	-0.0990437753994984	-0.08445196610781265	-0.01750542412334676	0.012779229400710843	0.09633748646191756	0.16014222059602543	0.21804860428818956	0.2806140368716786	0.2910966414024436	0.34132140634396024	0.3600661476435073	0.4799098949279721	0.7020232091182068	0.881396232316664	1.729513572116839	
"Western Union" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost as it has now appeared on Region 2 in England. This - being a blessing in some ways - is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a Region 1 release. It beggars belief! It simply doesn't make sense!<br /><br />Produced by Fox in 1941 "Western Union" was directed by Fritz Lang. This was only the second occasion the great German director undertook to direct a western! He had done an excellent job the year before with Fox's "The Return Of Frank James" and would have only one more western outing in 1952 with the splendid "Rancho Notorious". Lang was no Ford or Hawks but with "Western Union" he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well. Beautifully photographed in early three strip Technicolor by Edward Cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore who really has little to do in the picture. An actress who never made anything of her career. Her presence here is merely cosmetic.<br /><br />It is curious that Robert Young has top billing over Scott! It is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains. Young doesn't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western. He just looks plain silly going up against Barton McLane in a gunfight! An actor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947)- Young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was TV's "Marcus Welby MD" in the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91.<br /><br />"Western Union" recounts the connection by telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from marauding Sioux and to also take on McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends. Robert Young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with Scott for the affections of Miss Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by - and irritatingly so some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctor.<br /><br />Altogether though a spanking good western, albeit on Region 2, but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics. UGH!<br /><br />Footnote: Interestingly the associate producer on "Western Union" was Harry Joe Brown who later with Randolph Scott would create a partnership that would produce some of Scott's finest westerns in the fifties.	-6.26996068822104	-6.2233278339625775	-4.397857407722144	-3.9445539064717567	-1.8862111113071234	-1.8694885269163937	-1.8410036058601673	-0.7732921827649822	0.13878392040543455	0.2582117534918234	0.670578038124352	0.7483961795103985	0.767710673824061	1.072553313029766	1.1150883536620657	1.12910542995977	1.1359293617805237	1.2971553663435078	1.506896325210731	1.6992628006800508	1.8446900950590381	2.3177804850037678	4.642371278316142	6.199289092430834	11.895543770920884	
the movie sucked, it wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting. they tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but failed. and thinking it's cool to like this movie, next to the hype, are the only reasons that this movie is a success...<br /><br />the fact that at this moment 50% voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me, either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes, and should be dealt with. anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising. It's success can only be described as a marketing marvel.	-1.788434830487272	-1.078776940345021	-1.0591661775388936	-0.8343330869321883	-0.8289574365087764	-0.7168261637081442	-0.5277602767972993	-0.3960128541566283	-0.2205534145037435	-0.07188407540677252	-0.04636668204702113	0.07269604178363911	0.09088026645761171	0.1071013021228571	0.116897900591858	0.198457109379734	0.24194115301042507	0.2443714881731083	0.3599063778321063	0.412794233125209	0.5624060441677514	0.612816915336095	0.7986001423040343	1.6760118111438556	2.6220571645932393	
An American woman, her European husband and children return to her mother's home in "Watch on the Rhine," a 1943 film based on the play by Lillian Hellman, and starring Paul Lukas (whom I believe is repeating his stage role here), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. An anti-Fascist, a worker in the underground movement, many times injured, and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law. But he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests (Coulouris) is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out.<br /><br />Great performances abound in this film, written very much to put forth Lillian Hellman's liberal point of view. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released, as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe American homes. The movie's big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca." Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt. The monologue he has about the need to kill is gut-wrenching, just to mention one scene.<br /><br />Though this isn't what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie, she gives a masterful performance here as Kurt's loyal and loving wife, Sara. Her acting tugs at the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender.<br /><br />The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions. Lillian Hellman is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes," she has written some truly sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story given A casting and production values by Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.	-3.684179113619877	-2.5509048248938346	-1.9281100658086288	-1.8373208933206227	-1.0816398478106382	-0.4697826297148154	-0.41912411565713703	0.09351145490080703	0.16202622616006174	0.18886918333778743	0.33299716192102696	0.4541920404585618	0.7270463479583793	0.8177520417134101	0.8412478609067016	0.9991329110604168	1.0771580246657724	1.3364983856766322	1.362530652777885	1.553039702128486	1.5532654604782956	1.640331646169408	2.238344500168907	3.7787982534742883	4.337348244181984	
'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in 1988. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American remake also called 'The Vanishing') but there are times it comes close.<br /><br />Especially the opening moments are terrific. We see a man, later we learn his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. Later we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this.<br /><br />From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. We see how Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), befriends a guy named Axel (as a kid played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him.<br /><br />The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.<br /><br />Minor spoilers herein.<br /><br />The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the end. It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.	-4.522982414567793	-3.8827507774896466	-3.365597440400252	-3.2010982957691794	-1.5836906098684294	-1.3300034900767173	-1.1081194694573897	-0.48551342827683946	-0.34101401768846173	-0.1987260443432853	-0.12527291807942972	0.051168974648699656	0.06958752682085353	0.10863281162829075	0.1425374708812132	1.0984726114079084	1.1959135832700671	1.458120656075351	1.8216294914284674	2.0154809482477782	2.0725448378359954	2.567728829641455	4.952497907273044	5.567450093839264	7.303479285990121	
I saw this movie over 5 years ago and the subject still infuriates me, as it should. Her anger and initiative were inspiring. Not that I would takeover an army and kill people, but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind. This is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter.	-0.9531209850710314	-0.8042708252385502	-0.649312247316471	-0.5984554456001232	-0.3408167298207749	-0.3320643499895326	-0.2655643204183368	-0.262733023144319	-0.23428570369847668	-0.13167157333915133	-0.09424208329706485	-0.04122487490760286	0.01145670885831046	0.022024138195336176	0.09372333173032164	0.11064484522612078	0.18463563359455581	0.34893184704379004	0.4837127261255617	0.4913128725562559	0.5493814911720414	0.6054048249770545	0.8137469624026479	1.1658695697706452	1.1735273416663832	
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made. I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making. It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces." <br /><br />The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute. Quite literally, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels. A seemingly insignificant object may be shown  a rack of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack, a bottle of pills, etc.  but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more  a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene (or perhaps the movie in total), which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront. Such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie, but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a rapid-fire, relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness, lest they miss something important. In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this? It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.<br /><br />The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summarized by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent, unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. He posits that Ji-woon Kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the EXACT occurrences of each and every scene of the film. If our good friend Zaphod had been paying attention, he would have noticed  for example  the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's assertion of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them. Can Ji-woon Kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film? I think not.<br /><br />Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod that cannot "get" A Tale of Two Sisters, because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence. The movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You need only put them together. Remember, the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind  he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that  when completed  bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. A Tale of Two Sisters is not. It's ironic that Zaphod claims Darko to be more masterfully constructed than A Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darko not only provides almost NO objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina cliché that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence. I'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is an important one. Although it does perplex me that Zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort. He apparently likes his "intelligent" films in the most superficial form possible. This is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Just read the threads by Opiemar within the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned OBVIOUS.<br /><br />I'd like to say more, but I've come to my 1,000 word limit. All that has been said here needed to be said. So be it now said!	-9.959434194441021	-6.6888126532825005	-6.050412306863979	-5.517696364567516	-3.225228998630085	-2.56902988249131	-2.5684022300078624	-0.453293242260028	-0.41319801746912505	-0.10039357824468129	-0.0727575769054698	-0.013995776752804882	0.3896091150897234	0.4322981008059426	0.44623522123300424	0.5324060046925084	1.5552586512737825	1.5576843681780834	1.9618781468713375	2.6372055176441096	3.309371391364736	3.349723770618743	6.342576735629322	8.101755666843914	15.608430892034251	
I'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. However, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a Shelley Hack reference while on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. Based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her Charlie's Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here it was made around 1987. You sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values. It seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class. And while by no means would I expect a low-budget trash fest like this to be politically correct, the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other. Even so I'd still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made, second only to "Nail Gun Massacre."	-5.7580089724754595	-2.127115271944898	-2.1074488536980955	-2.0936505100634206	-2.044779935187547	-1.9944708390196633	-1.6533168798495905	-0.38184601762108256	-0.31942187040234404	-0.2389254404739927	-0.2266281728463345	-0.13039143587577656	0.14222131839190935	0.3301837757862999	0.34582373417862694	0.40843637379775855	0.41185011343261113	0.4542872465239239	0.48705310149074726	0.5139099052183019	0.5580075128233235	0.564821622232662	2.5381600236789352	2.7227196733016297	5.874648191278663	
The 3rd in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy. I don't know why this movie shoved me into it, but somehow it did. I found myself rooting for Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time he blew one of them away I felt good. This movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it did? There is a good build-up to the fireworks finale in which Bronson goes on a rampage. But as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't measure up. If I lived in that neighborhood, I would get out as fast as I could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. I know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. I had to give it a 4. Sure there are good "blow 'em away" scenes but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this movie. This movie gives you a sense of rejoice. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To sum it up, this is far from being the original Death Wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up.	-5.3917221056311	-3.4865121277786915	-3.060459091065543	-2.1920543173707254	-1.8915998341902287	-1.4024171435118578	-1.1213276978066333	-0.7756685422181349	-0.7754869142400943	-0.4637172041753804	-0.08210695938961901	0.19392817638349374	0.2261904797311839	0.2801006121514033	0.41977955989863236	0.5934989753487276	0.6023941743849556	0.8581279964941585	0.8867598058370674	1.0729779212379094	1.3503414461847392	1.5547523112299526	1.6984013221639922	3.092068377115832	6.606083930682897	
When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original Grease," you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.<br /><br />If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption.<br /><br />For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows <br /><br />1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way ("Score Tonight," "Reproduction," "Do It For Our Country," and "Prowlin'") without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.<br /><br />2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds. <br /><br />3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty (I guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake: Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.	-11.623284146816408	-5.493078613240375	-5.283540044827999	-5.237136123140393	-5.042451903486389	-3.889475087028657	-3.7343928511793214	-1.1383118103456813	-0.8089471747681005	-0.7038575127152173	-0.56130634610925	-0.3233883285199828	-0.27727484570931665	-0.22466273492253058	0.3986492007753486	0.43139765406960523	0.46749141362808977	0.5991838691884372	1.275914573415085	1.5950936843418295	2.0261743877579486	2.523797593761094	4.6636538813366055	6.680128426862343	13.155092427261945	
A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on "Dante's Inferno," there is nothing especially clever. Dante's "Divine Comedy" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to High Art.<br /><br />I suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked. Be that as it may, few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire.<br /><br />The high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of "Schoolhouse Rock" on the subject of lobbying and the "revolving door." It's really a shame that the entire film couldn't have been a musical. That would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun.	-1.6744408680008753	-1.5878006673641059	-1.5549428365586295	-1.3748043440800592	-1.2151062897871634	-1.0629051867824137	-0.713522894135	-0.3151979018356348	-0.1966917969524082	-0.1805164393345815	-0.10810161637323167	0.04929017684658679	0.09648319387306804	0.40066340144717294	0.5188250700748086	0.5505551284531135	0.5777009366379995	0.6045596167624583	0.6611749242526864	0.6949711577426849	0.8005908372312367	1.210126971941926	2.2542210156254336	2.4402965042434754	3.6188053068720416	
Why didn't critics like this movie?? I don't get it. This is easily my favorite Clive Barker effort. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the film just never leaves that stupid house) and, lets face it, "Lord of Illusions" doesn't move at all!!! I have loved Barker's writing for years, especially his "Books of Blood". Terrifically entertaining. He has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a Stephen King. He freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements. I love love love love it. I also realize , however, that Barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer. And fantasy just isn't my bag. Puts me right to sleep. Always has. I also think Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to wander a bit. That was my experience when trying to read "The Damnation Game". It started out well. Then 100 pages in I thought "where is this going?" because it wasn't going ANYWHERE.<br /><br />I read "Cabal" (the book Nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. I ESPECIALLY like the elaboration on Decker's character. The way the mask talked to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply presents it. Black and white. There it is. He gives it a simplicity that's attractive and believable. When asked why Decker kills he says (simply) "Because I like it". Probably something Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point.<br /><br />But I actually liked the film Nightbreed better than Cabal. I adore the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. ADORE IT. I think it is just beautiful. Lord of Illusions had some of this as well. Some of the drawings in the beginning, during the Nightbreed credit sequence. It's like an entire vocabulary Barker dreamed up just for the Nightbreed world. I'd be curious to know how much was purely his design. I know he is an AMAZING artist who his own style and language as an artist.<br /><br />Nightbreed is also (I think) BArker's most entertaining film. It moves very quickly. Well edited. It doesn't drag like Lord of Illusions does a little bit. Very quick. Everything in it is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie. The stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff. That mask is frightening. I'd be curious to know if Barker designed that as well. It's not just a hokey Jason or "Scream"-type mask. Something about it is really disturbing.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great flick. Definitely check it out if you haven't seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror films of all time. In my opinion Clive BArker's best. It IS scary and violent though, be warned	-12.506952209052114	-8.442172271298126	-7.613515657693782	-5.585512566589649	-4.495612301709446	-1.1396298101824793	-1.0782478232789132	-0.9566607887229119	-0.9407269516095669	-0.744270722522655	-0.5824167131709163	-0.44881294731258736	-0.2512479782661633	0.2669118046508465	1.1232472113256993	1.789134614669067	2.733935587882218	2.7948584052163605	3.3228985257787347	3.9552846386808573	4.747910433000822	5.019690039641541	10.209003067311588	12.684968618751515	14.422499700108984	
This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen! The cast is an international one - Australian-pretending-to-be-British, stage American and a character with an English name sporting an unrecognizable "European" accent. What passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity. So short were the shoestrings of this film's budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition. In the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalk'n slash thrillers of extraordinary (though not necessarily "high") quality which have been made on no budget at all. Recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary "Blair Witch Project" and of course - the most recent - that low-budget winner, SAW, featuring practically unknown leads (Gary Elwes is just someone you don't remember even if you have seen him before). In DARKHUNTERS, it is shocking to find a known character actor, Dominique Pinon and Hollywood has-been Jeff Fahey struggling valiantly to save the film. It is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man (Fahey) in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines. I would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible!	-5.857447736156859	-2.9515074765983997	-2.6895513240065476	-2.479208095639549	-2.1140155687195303	-2.082007615314619	-2.012063375783987	-0.4819444061115245	-0.25766572165151813	-0.09778547368576745	-0.07761864531993631	-0.033946377968599964	0.08718496252873412	0.09919965737752126	0.1566022207133563	0.16152422172705871	0.22310487597952888	0.4433135676174714	0.9293232405062782	0.9656545865414248	1.134271255906015	1.305539142336369	2.5999039031297504	3.4705126429995667	6.434842755695223	
It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression. It appears that the grim realities of a Nation caught up in the aftermath of this Economic Disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace. A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball.<br /><br />Likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema. The presence of a Radio in just about everyone's house hold kept Depression Era America at once attuned to World's Events and provided many a Drama and (especially) Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.<br /><br />The literature of the time also flourished at all levels. The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. There were mediums that were ancestral to them. Obviously,the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visual/narrative method of story telling.<br /><br />The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine. The inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales. The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borrough's TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's ZORRO. The 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8's BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER,MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands, among many others.<br /><br />One other was DOC SAVAGE, a full-blooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only "picture" of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, Doc was the prototype Super Hero.<br /><br />He also assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a given field. So we had a top rated: Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Geologist-Archaeologist-Paleontologist, etc.<br /><br />The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's, and were published into the middle '50's. Then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new "container", the paperback book. A fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.<br /><br />The re-introduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month (and for a while more). Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie! But when, by what Producer? Well, the venerable "Man of Bronze" was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together. It was veteran Stop-action Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who did the film along with Warner Brothers.<br /><br />When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely "No Name" as far familiarity with the viewers. With former Tarzan of TV,Ron Ely's nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler (as the villainous, Captain Seas); no other name would have been recognized. And, just maybe that was a plus in this case.<br /><br />The story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going. Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.<br /><br />From the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured "Camp" humor as the Batman TV series. Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes. (For Example, an experiment of Doc's with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.) The whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little 'Camp' every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. We are also puzzled about Mr. George Pal's being the Producer(his last). He who had been so well known for Special Effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the Pulp Character's world.<br /><br />I can remember seeing it quite vividly. Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) was in the Hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, Michelle(08/14/75). Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her Grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward, it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre, 63rd & Kedzie, here in Chicago.<br /><br />Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was sort of let down by the final product. I could accept a little of this 'Camp' business, but would not have objected if Mr.Pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give it all a little more Pulp/Comic/Serial type excitement.<br /><br />And yet, the cast, headed-up by Mr. Ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable. The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.<br /><br />And maybe that's just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.	-12.488131805383665	-8.487498940551735	-5.973374451031975	-4.8780337672205105	-4.272390629146736	-3.8641839996066527	-3.77954178662988	-1.3086389587564453	-1.056261863800689	-0.769546918946444	-0.39099965249715607	0.046524271663858474	0.3406846354611286	0.5483920530759532	0.6547171269233778	0.9050505211092377	1.7364025851963236	2.591494698821814	2.6610560502550955	3.3121489148479144	3.5923229626504543	3.9500384799585952	5.791092387006839	8.769051040050053	18.45966100189057	
Let me just say - I love the horror genre to the extent that I see every single one that I can get my hands on regardless (except really low quality b-movie horrors which I could do without) and recently have become a big fan of Eastern horrors. Little did I know that a Korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the Japanese Ringu (or the American Ring), or even quality US movies such as the Sixth Sense and The Others, and the widely acclaimed Hong Kong horror 'The Eye'.<br /><br />Previously 'The Ring' had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of 'The Tale of Two Sisters' any day - the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you'll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot... the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date. The acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the Ring - I did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off. <br /><br />Still I am glad it didn't come back to haunt me later that Sadako/Samara did from the Ring - after all such feelings are unpleasant and The Tale of Two Sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling, but one that hopefully won't leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special. But do remember.. if you don't understand the plot after the first viewing, a repeat viewing is more than advised.. I personally didn't have time for this since it was late so I flicked through scenes on the DVD, some numerous times until I had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net, seemed Ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation. And the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful.<br /><br />All in all - a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same 'level' remake (its been purchased by Dreamworks) simply because of the Korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on DVDs while they can... its one of the best you will get. Unfortunately due to the type of movie this is, there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what I did - watch it without knowing a single thing except its 'a tale of two sisters'! And be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time.	-3.169349952600923	-2.0138834876721696	-1.9528930768238597	-1.6569176742547815	-1.4815944835601458	-1.1794341437952325	-1.016703371138496	-0.8635607790103793	-0.4209252008914068	-0.29244613409836323	0.11051405972132955	0.18110760271150717	0.30146219515103356	0.33698814478232586	0.3775481418453049	0.38686970401887305	0.6006126717792808	0.8238802292826879	1.0185402610305236	1.091011882223157	1.4704163843069387	1.525945684727958	1.8845491928000226	2.8027144883402815	3.899178952663638	
"Tale of Two Sisters" has to be one of the creepiest films I've seen recently. In the end there is no actual supernatural element, despite what one is led to expect throughout the film. The story seems to be about two sisters, who, upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence (later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution) are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi-polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time., but some presence as yet unexplained. It is later revealed that the younger sister is dead, and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister, who was unable to save her, and her step-mother, who was callous enough to let her die. Much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film, but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion. Definitely not light viewing; watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen. It's a hell of a puzzler.	-2.7410382783318736	-1.6673936659856226	-1.3276624949424503	-1.1786503629314578	-1.1154396804640354	-0.7772414637358	-0.6205593699157341	-0.20016107291821034	-0.1867364248745098	-0.09910859389141403	-0.06279111069738005	0.04640096326892934	0.0589959048982802	0.14365677729184315	0.21923237291789563	0.2227236979696348	0.2622078202188503	0.27973602755947263	0.4140495481848262	0.5982864209490114	0.8711743143693501	0.9137502887505333	1.0394509451182925	1.7480795938111529	3.440539421336892	
I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that I believe that the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film. Warner Baxter in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of TR's character. <br /><br />Like TR all of the Stoddard sons serve in World War I, in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed. <br /><br />But what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things? That's Susan Hayward's job here. In one of her earliest prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son, has an affair with another, and starts making a play for the third. It's an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an Oscar in I Want to Live.<br /><br />I suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as Theodore Roosevelt was and Warner Baxter portrays, everyone is afraid to tell Father what's going on. The sons and also their governess Ingrid Bergman. Here's where the plot gets a little silly. Bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by Baxter and wife Fay Wray for their kids. Wray dies and Baxter suffers some financial reversals in business. Bergman has to be let go. She goes back to France and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up. <br /><br />I'm sorry, but I can't believe the kids need a governess now. Hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn't the kids who brought her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would have gotten on with her life. <br /><br />One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film I have was edited out. Possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have.<br /><br />It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not have done another film together in the Fifties when Hayward was at her heights and Bergman had just made a comeback.<br /><br />Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons. And I'm willing to believe that a good deal of Ingrid was left on the cutting room floor.	-8.172295533265462	-4.570244397578537	-3.405672727686037	-2.355955538007787	-2.3207006935930217	-2.1476007842612934	-2.0520146465913247	-1.857307193843817	-1.0506570537286266	-0.39445858609208617	-0.31531181295378835	-0.22664261418784468	0.16543096283158237	0.22280200864585856	0.612639909534705	1.0447730021724007	1.1770833583977311	1.3759054464207934	1.5130277487930117	1.676057620523006	1.902693926667843	1.9201424748193427	2.2972395140698834	4.782055858470419	9.16905907351599	
I'm grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew in reviving the once-moribund Visayan film understorey. "Panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular (that claims more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the Philippines. Downside: the corny and stilted acting of the American antagonist. The other item that I didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the "period" costume of the same character, and above all, his bright red kit-car that I suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster. Without those small yet glaring details, "Panaghoy" would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating--daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Addendum: this film sure beats Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which provided a different view of the Visayas during the Second World War. Alos, there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of "Noli Me Tangere".	-3.9929756792813755	-1.6913922205430696	-1.624522657666457	-1.46059387872603	-1.2757496560478987	-1.0182498330488663	-0.6038179380775128	-0.47444445726598355	-0.4712859129063376	-0.39425797241532345	-0.26499936016223047	-0.15931182783530665	-0.08589131437756312	-0.07092751125247775	0.008134922634368703	0.08852408948228443	0.2566181612539954	0.5017254903194194	0.5903368106973292	0.5919637483927597	0.7544988289376313	0.8970293918743467	1.237486858777907	1.9953444930926834	4.152551358651017	
Lonesome Jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. Both boys around 30, living at home, with absolutely nothing going for them. I live in the Midwest and I can't name one family like this. I picked it up because I kind of like Buscemi acting humor. Now I realize I need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work. The acting and camera work and editing was fine. The first 15 minutes got you set, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing Jerry Springer trailer trash type of story. The female members of my family were begging me to turn it off, but I prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the entire movie. The male family members, as expected, simply walked out after the first 30 minutes.	-2.6331315982488284	-2.237045301426932	-1.993999716918506	-1.6019060279780342	-1.3380981340053735	-1.0407018591826909	-0.9280845101394128	-0.7173791687029082	-0.5891679615878023	-0.5355562978361459	-0.2842256694918353	-0.2248482695115835	-0.16017294591863754	-0.0692429816258148	-0.05056450779956767	-0.04272019415903347	0.19428570831309022	0.271208704327378	0.9659913240067464	0.97976990372819	1.0616002860398073	1.0919919954780088	1.3802859574568092	2.6968993366699534	3.649042629557786	
Elephant Walk (1954) Starring an early Peter Finch as lord of the manor in some God-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad Englishmen, staying out in the midday sun and going berserk. Well eventually they do, after the typhoid or cholera outbreak, of course, and much mayhem ensues. Taylor replaced an ailing Vivien Leigh in this pot boiler/adventure flick. When the elephants storm the house and trap Liz on the grand staircase I still get goose bumps. Thank goodness Dana Andrews is around to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures.

Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-soo). Eun-joo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them but Su-mi's manner is bitter to her. Su-mi hates Eun-joo because the father let her act like the house wife after the sisters' mother died. Seeing her attitude, Eun-joo is getting to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere among them.<br /><br />As if called in by the atmosphere, series of mysterious things occur in the house. When Su-mi is hanging her dress in her wardrobe, there have been already hung a lot of dresses of the same design. When she put her diary into a drawer, she finds another diary of the same kind there. When she is sleeping in her bed with scared Su-yeon, a nightmare awakes her and she finds a woman standing on her -- and a hand dangles out of the woman's skirt!<br /><br />Mysterious things occur to the other people, too. On the evening of next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and his wife visit the family and they have a dinner together. Eun-joo cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child, but nobody is interested in her talk. She says the crazy man annoyed the brother, but he says he doesn't know anything about the man.<br /><br />Listening to their talk, the brother's wife has a panic.<br /><br />After the dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and the sisters becomes at its worst. Eun-joo pulls Su-yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it. Su-mi saves the crying-out sister and complains to their father what Eun-joo has done to his daughter. But his response is unexpected. "Give me a break." says he angrily, "Su-mi, please. Don't make me tired any more."<br /><br />And the following words out of the father's mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house.<br /><br />To tell the truth, I hate horror movies. Although I seated myself at a theater because my intuition told me the movie was something different, I was regretting what my curiosity had made me act when it started showing. The regret, however, had changed into joy for expectation ten minutes later.<br /><br />This film is a tragic mystery more than a horror -- painful more than horrible; beautiful more than sensational. That may have a hard core horror fan disappointed, but for a mystery fan like me, this film is a must see.

Every once in a while the conversation will turn to "favorite movies." I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.<br /><br />I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.<br /><br />No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.<br /><br />James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.<br /><br />This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, right ahead!" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.<br /><br />The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.<br /><br />I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.<br /><br />Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.	-8.729852135581893	-7.539305971432686	-6.690334294703107	-6.660362895406515	-3.5866050216096035	-2.8592271397438376	-2.5700344735232497	-2.2598828230229	-1.2831478200725714	-0.3537257965592126	-0.33693009850941014	-0.2499144257166137	-0.22273488339520384	0.14302066510575498	0.5540705226492659	1.2073938252773768	1.2820259646909635	2.430814844234206	2.606146540322489	2.9058412144738917	3.676156695877093	4.064915074509502	6.586483920171384	8.596419247341661	14.754997865999812

ROLL is a wonderful little film. Toby Malone plays an 18 year old kid (very well acted, by the way) who is into soccer. Malone's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops, and some prostitutes ... and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law, what the contents of either gym bag is, and even what gender a key biker is. Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels.<br /><br />For me, ROLL reinforced three opinions that I already held before seeing ROLL. Those opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation.<br /><br />2. Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian. The cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive. I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes.<br /><br />3.

This great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5!Why not!It is a great portrayal of the life of Christ without the ruthless sensationalism of The Passion of The Christ.Johnny Cash did great things for God which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most,like our churches.The film itself took less than a month to film as Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him through it.Great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans.At least the Billy Graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new Christians.Thanks Fox for producing it.As Walk the Line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece.Movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves! In summary I believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright, honestly portrayed and a great witness to the Christian faith!	-1.2609951898808212	-0.8961900950194334	-0.8881585747782696	-0.8397665323215887	-0.721002873696112	-0.699638710198717	-0.5015148690137052	-0.4009442955592356	-0.33106732178085996	-0.24347791786466952	-0.13463003103716764	-0.0010024320694318467	0.012183625521154498	0.09114767675451374	0.09673772200340122	0.1694951720258717	0.21482527262563889	0.2931655574272418	0.29684624705850626	0.326872619724122	0.5311302272096543	0.7554837194100253	0.7582110419456622	0.9233467044641709	1.8337447565233302	
The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.<br /><br />According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.<br /><br />Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.<br /><br />The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best art&set direction for a color film, and best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.<br /><br />The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez. This was Veidt's career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. <br /><br />Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.<br /><br />The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today. It's an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.	-5.752573067184604	-3.474607316314451	-2.8099207583144437	-1.8437275278453873	-1.7814107022895735	-1.728664418721629	-1.3868220028224794	-0.9492236657198201	-0.3450977687476542	-0.25181782668455716	0.09935272803789613	0.24114542193277086	0.2569453085238764	0.29232134096978535	0.3078127357087541	0.629086783102593	0.8224849551284936	0.8634471061423645	1.1355797089835713	1.5008869267261495	1.5220543395458215	2.1357856610808175	3.3177960668614737	3.765036881734855	8.614078955424725	
Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. Upon this point I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. However, what I can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun!<br /><br />OK..so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series?<br /><br />The point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm!<br /><br />Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman.<br /><br />Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  Priceless!<br /><br />Simply put, the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it. Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)	-2.862497608935973	-2.5845959350027328	-2.395005080419998	-2.218808961908998	-1.7830085065861065	-0.9089680627884162	-0.8620233495323294	-0.8231610130270058	-0.5358403597281148	-0.20662222231565713	0.05123067993998201	0.24449375382837146	0.25430733195855226	0.3500879233543438	0.4690678866924837	0.4808651252394262	0.6726251399137552	0.7196692643154032	1.0081413823416554	1.1711629923614388	1.8727492077198586	2.118027570549846	2.29833065509215	3.4167630207041877	4.885335481485282	
All in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from Warner Brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before WWII), provided you don't take it at all seriously. The movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, JFK. (This one may actually be more honest about it, though, as it essentially admits along the way that it's not to be taken as particularly fact-based, but more of a stylishly semi-heroic portrayal.) It's worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today; the NY Times review conceded that audiences would "dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film," described the biographical account of Custer's life as "fanciful," and pointed out that the presentation of Custer's motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts. They could have really gone overboard in building up Custer, one supposes, but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, principled and inspirational.<br /><br />Flynn and DeHavilland, doing their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play off each other so easily at this point, that it's not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here. With a first-time pairing, it would be hard to imagine what could really draw Elizabeth to Custer, but these two make it work. The movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together (the greatly underrated Michael Curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the previous year's similar-themed Santa Fe Trail, it's understandable if he chose to opt out of this one. (They all started together with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both terrific - so we can't really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh.)<br /><br />Raoul Walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well, as does Warner Bros' outstanding cast of "usual suspects" and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc). I would have liked it better if Kennedy's character had been a bit less standard (I generally like his work), but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and I suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle, as he'd only been in films for one year (Walsh probably took him for this after doing High Sierra together).<br /><br />Various highlights include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of "Garryowen" as the cavalry theme. The last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. A thoroughly rousing adventure.<br /><br />8 of 10	-3.5877636045355668	-2.932958160262357	-2.4741697580632693	-2.382544294557956	-2.217914858792417	-1.378201682332869	-1.2813829287758258	-1.018114349508383	-0.9284490219866464	-0.5949176888591116	-0.5666519626866956	-0.3614089248981402	-0.08217008457204009	0.07699016704941308	0.2416087233703108	0.3507901077368879	0.6040668214697539	0.7960117786220473	1.8927163813136705	1.9728402828908569	2.313755855058783	2.451535802643158	2.8817877025868586	4.070459927425427	5.28064610158749	
I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.<br /><br />	-6.454295353244051	-3.370829344942639	-2.7681780187327676	-2.6239886887953245	-2.315408849530238	-1.7336415517894759	-1.543179640947989	-0.5152983839351905	-0.37987155601134714	-0.24614487320083764	-0.10771196556340885	0.1789017499211404	0.21102033031560014	0.22503642707600383	0.27234440715146424	0.31814298949205194	0.4065352432784077	0.9897389528705163	0.9992955806422059	1.029927398039989	1.4921372054286157	1.9599513000400495	3.3896957896876994	3.731708956103097	7.746035485136319	
It is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages--to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful production, and, to adults, for a literate script, fine production values, good casting/acting, all bound together with a fine Rozsa score. Two roughly contemporary films accomplish this--"Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some of the back story on this production is fascinating. This production, commenced in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood, and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts! The producer, Alexander Korda, was subsequently knighted in 1942. Here is a unique case of the intersection of art, commerce, and politics! By all means, secure a good CD of this film for your library!	-3.970498357901992	-2.4804735911333897	-1.642460435101952	-0.9616615361820284	-0.9050037142499123	-0.18709729068476347	-0.1082322880924716	0.20245590437601044	0.24246409855305875	0.246051466581991	0.28419253502307207	0.6539983142478966	0.6652321254502619	0.6663623144036701	0.8522803143784254	0.8726313292269261	0.9914266705128838	1.0851646678611397	1.1368559146431054	1.4328342517806314	1.4776510011260058	1.5905227849658354	1.9135106123873036	2.9851349672442438	3.638541684801356	
David Tennant and Sarah Parish's brilliant acting had me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me. My husband suffered a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage in 1977 and required a major operation which involved lifting his brain and plugging the leak. Like Tricia I was naive enough to expect that he would return to being his former self. After over 25 years of loving and caring for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew. He then petitioned for and I am now going through a divorce. I do hope the programme helped people to understand what it is like to cope with brain injury.	-2.4120163122248535	-1.39393313809574	-1.3348683148824856	-1.2296768998467098	-0.9627113921351129	-0.899191892415543	-0.7328883946154332	-0.398557673814808	-0.2783790149990009	-0.22239559174145596	-0.09779813240274268	-0.06224149443237822	0.08079424435203848	0.10334967456730905	0.1410094468664539	0.19589804038699277	0.23057702130219626	0.4257494236106297	0.44899912323271823	0.5127556851365326	0.5363728824444156	0.5696430019375746	0.6446480220168317	1.73041081206352	3.1960575220880307	
This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a Bible-thumping movie. I expected it to truly be a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. As previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. I felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones. If you go to church, it'll probably be shown there for free some time. Other than the cover-up of its true subject matter, the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned. But I have to say I walked out an hour into the movie when I saw what direction it was headed and that I was not going to be entertained, but preached to.	-3.317510693343832	-2.2133876906678998	-1.4320795619165223	-1.4039127301457102	-1.2509729042470992	-0.7910446532631035	-0.4586709696726635	-0.3415344629260921	-0.12157245292475723	-0.04478530755431067	0.0730826185832803	0.14138427786074917	0.1632533983548543	0.1982670329460529	0.20664978575589596	0.2675456430999755	0.27915602165823467	0.29857716031341053	0.5596738386386086	0.5980271965901561	0.867299155025854	1.3950319791068582	1.4021375987839386	2.037990890195479	4.242253546408829	
If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. The story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines. The final reworked rendition of "The Christmas Story" poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With its desperate attempt to be hip and current, this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like "The Grinch" will remain timeless. A sad waste of effort by all involved, a veritable "jumping of the shark" for the Shrek franchise.	-3.9395310379561113	-2.189684710344169	-1.9704719983957089	-1.960166606426653	-1.515796092907916	-1.308859409485927	-1.133708698223022	-0.5315167038743871	-0.38807005964797525	-0.28506226768457243	-0.08412586873348886	0.00118815243487784	0.03306313840264209	0.0454121427819933	0.20629963991896774	0.2276479125853736	0.31450019536122487	0.6328092325408338	0.6335900269257053	0.662425362694765	0.8906518439352872	1.022882704418728	1.4079423311675574	2.5365537938662617	4.509497391893893	
Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabbé who wrote the original 'The Vanishing' (Spoorloos) it does have the same overall feel, except for that Koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyric. The beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is in the end. A surprise emotional ending. As you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film, but it is done all very beautifully. Never explicit, but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour. It is a shame American films can't be as open an honoust as this one. Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject, 'De Grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste. 'De Grot' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years. When you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved. What can we ask more of a film? Anyway, this film even gives more....	-1.8823113025648774	-1.747946422589042	-1.4981295046887526	-1.0667083796017662	-0.5138965991448248	-0.34506101983150933	-0.3430537553009982	-0.29646122412087084	-0.23670207658990228	-0.16488828390386812	-0.10549379305021947	-0.10465165362768097	0.05777653650879547	0.13194785382313534	0.20530057933305967	0.2450253077545301	0.27788882554456823	0.34689973907956034	0.5033411300066905	0.6889139958779258	1.3430889728056625	1.4531357880115472	2.045897223599194	2.351931339332559	2.3580964586086126	
The original Australian Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why do American producers need to remake & ruin yet another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais, It was an absolute masterpiece, and there was no need to remake it. The producers said that the British humour from "The Office" and the Australian humour from "Kath & Kim" would not translate to an American audience......... WHAT??? So basically they are saying that Americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes, so they need to remake the shows with over-the-top childish gags, so that the Americans can understand the humour. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague!!	-1.5631452335418252	-1.1340482349435004	-1.0905170385507266	-0.8371297142688059	-0.7854736095439605	-0.7299100668777204	-0.554984240623329	-0.20508682403190087	-0.19293194849506262	-0.0025739122769120465	0.012663013724413232	0.09098037783588911	0.18598706215459748	0.22800892138001394	0.32593217291097926	0.4071153340705713	0.439819877276302	0.5391984605420485	0.5610968843290779	0.7408301188873591	0.7475993711323661	0.8292821013576603	1.8258760121814328	1.8326018583853716	3.059234707782685	
Although not the best Anime I have ever seen but I enjoyed Lady Death.<br /><br />I have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />The animation was OK, I got the sense of the 80's anime from it which is what set it off for me. Why everyone else hates that is beyond me.<br /><br />Character development was fine. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death around. for you who don't like it, obviously wasn't paying attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens, and she used his words.<br /><br />Creamtor was a nice mentor/soldier for her. his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie.<br /><br />I think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider. cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime Vampire Hunter D	-2.911232130155884	-2.2835857036068967	-1.4700832448443137	-0.984363423715271	-0.7564875295603186	-0.7108403916783876	-0.6641581995396214	-0.6526278704517003	-0.5569265934071116	-0.5461607288202621	-0.2785568402727409	-0.07670048493534977	-0.0695953195030157	0.17770513432323368	0.1789407242258117	0.3990686590386006	0.8378312410697821	0.8653837956267004	0.9378980135606345	0.9845025444420311	1.0787816727090693	1.156668722976667	1.7589809010976831	1.8991487756174392	3.586164794740845	
It's strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you've seen. This movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller, guns, techno, baddies, cash, etc, and yet it stands out from your average Hollywood also-ran. I would credit this to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has a cool confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women I've ever seen on screen. Another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to Jamaica after the beginning. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful you'll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night, with a Run'n'Coke. . . .I know I did. I'm very glad I saw this movie - it was just too nice to miss!	-1.450561961156915	-1.446372361464428	-0.9705438432532124	-0.7187963224738346	-0.7160591376477204	-0.4316358249879767	-0.3474211428683566	-0.3082262467726361	-0.1722802663875168	-0.08772279643008551	-0.06350904772270868	-0.062458819936419246	5.046003414694231E-4	0.02396207237569692	0.08212508173902408	0.10868529231241716	0.19617215683789935	0.5406189061906175	0.5689808651831214	0.7291891832711823	1.382423771085585	1.53559469064694	1.546302433009298	1.775430233361047	2.3233258594674986	
My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br />Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself.

YETI deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made. I saw it at a midnight screening in L.A. and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and THEN IT DOES! The millionaire who funds the project to thaw the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured into an ill-fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes, there is a mute boy (who sorta kinda looks like a girl) and he's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents (hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid??). Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti (once he thaws - which takes FOREVER) -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes "bedroom eyes" at her - it's like a large Barry White trying to seduce a groupie. In fact, once the large Yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti's nipple and yes, the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple GET HARD!!!! Yikes of all YIKES! Plus there's a collie dog in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a Lassie - there's also this insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the Italian girl's hair "Gee, thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout. You're the best." This film is more bizarre than something Ed Wood could have ever dreamt up. If you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out.	-4.720270027812013	-2.2571167124581333	-1.812489713960495	-1.611381671879711	-1.3773658132503384	-0.8511710228955198	-0.7272815120209332	-0.7023105877917355	-0.5200781173009353	-0.3659694120334454	-0.2004601832659659	-0.09432374319020703	-0.06091468341263097	-0.0017586614120509159	0.08695145222804936	0.15480845263840198	0.39403000066113125	0.5322430418040975	0.5913986794670032	0.6523619132481221	0.6711512599798038	0.9670705460219999	1.2648154828910165	2.7795501384657118	4.861859075686591	
Over Her Dead Body was a nice little movie.It was decent and entertaining, while still being pretty funny.There were a few cliché's, but I found most stuff fresh.At first I didn't think it was going to be good at all,when it started out.If you can get past the first 20 minutes though,the movie starts getting more interesting.This film wasn't burst out in laughter hilarious,and wasn't OH MY GOSH wonderful.It was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.I don't see how this movie was bad.It's rating is just a bit too low.I could've dealt with a 5.5,but a 4.8?Also,giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful.It was pretty good,and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1,which is what most people gave it.	-1.023336899941798	-0.7843825287969153	-0.6373240331898375	-0.5768353464839611	-0.4896281538938967	-0.29154103600156156	-0.21995624563559335	-0.20852961492968905	-0.12817081477580466	-0.10963321057524926	-0.10762184747439327	-0.0027828763359099493	0.017587740941110798	0.03396197375485734	0.03980870279280817	0.044397031716848404	0.0455627289993268	0.06917190831770675	0.09957491250974998	0.14628759954187845	0.23989819362134582	0.26443667172824875	0.2852432094632348	0.49693590181013764	1.1596773168670609	
I was blubbing like an idiot during the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television. I have to say that the idea of sitting down to view 90 minutes of what was bound to be pretty depressing material on a Sunday, was not a welcome one. The thought of yet another, over worthy, BAFTA winning possibility did not enthuse me......However the end result knocked me for 6. This is some of the best television I have seen in ages. For years I was under the impression that all originality had left the BBC's drama department. Our Friends in the North was the last production that truly blew me away and that was 10 years ago. However faith is restored and honour is satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! So many actors I can think of would have really gone to town on a part like this, but never once did I see Mr Tenant as an actor or as the Doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. I haven't had my heart wrenched this much since Daniel Craigs performance as Geordie Peacock all those years ago. Sarah Parish was also incredible and I really hope this role brings her better roles in the future. All of the cast were great but special mention must go to the director who really placed us inside Alans head. The toaster scene, in particular, made me feel quite queasy.	-3.4882215409638015	-2.5853192653272274	-2.492766988929183	-2.1875669706609284	-1.7915608286116405	-1.3390051577337452	-1.1833639637290727	-0.6933312562289635	-0.5059913817719729	-0.34133444513139005	-0.04901961047731457	0.06124622061318018	0.1374473417074598	0.2504364683055849	0.5869918146575916	0.7814994168919374	0.7880729655113842	0.8597206239205146	1.0477560002309863	1.2697620808907448	1.3242416188194597	1.6200749685074067	3.540287624120211	3.795420347669345	5.159162356191443	
Nynke is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the Oscar winning film Character (1997). But this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting...<br /><br />Sure, Nynke is a beautiful historic & costume drama (with fantastic acting by Monic Hendrickx!) in which you witness the personal growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum' in her marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this movie is 'a lovestory'. So it starts, and ends with their marriage. <br /><br />But THAT is where the director makes a crucial mistake! Nynke's exciting, independent life started when the marriage ended. She wrote several children's books and travelled around the world. What a great life she has lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back in the trammels of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of: the thought that her life extended just her marriage to Troelstra, being no one else but the mother of their kids.<br /><br />Let's all hope for Nynke II!	-2.199314089388601	-1.8694145994050533	-1.6792181784917644	-1.1902325468234953	-0.4103018166908541	-0.2843142662897319	-0.21217049306863592	-0.15803266692553422	-0.14844170903076848	-0.09264811229051784	-0.0894725651121703	0.1538178674453085	0.32161541516060876	0.3735863713735279	0.43074632494850806	0.5135751764388421	0.5325668222803219	0.7126815128598063	0.7655909676930926	0.8556584745112221	1.1453473146249522	1.5963200610089507	1.609698371921218	2.480562596586539	2.7313665134837395	
In my years of attending film festivals, I have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution, and they end up in the $3 bins at WalMart. I just found DVD of Yank Tanks there, great doc, but how sad for it to end up as a rock-bottom remainder.<br /><br />I loved this film, wish I'd seen it at the cinema in it's everything. I'd have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly. It's good for Americans to stretch a little. If the film's title helps the US audience to explore random chaos, all the better. Cinema imitates life & visa versa.<br /><br />Also, I found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not hard to figure out, make the gringo audiences do the math. Seeing a film, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded: I am an American watching a movie and they are translating the Euros into dollars for me. <br /><br />Looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer & director as well.	-3.988031246317953	-2.215474104576738	-2.0614077349672857	-1.6462286369400414	-1.3984854786527146	-1.0518648701888413	-0.9314164978458581	-0.8470526314473948	-0.302292194680375	-0.07770957581817034	-0.06085005896712752	0.069675815197111	0.09184551223858045	0.09567279889016644	0.13702345666788396	0.21471806265304347	0.30166474221168654	0.33042739945786054	0.5822049175169965	0.6568062753884168	1.0289678052777025	1.1698155443138947	1.4464340084114666	2.4986441920164975	4.978979949886832	
Forget the recent dire American remake which sadly tarnished the reputation of the French original by virtue of the director's involvement in both. This is a deftly- drawn romantic 90s noir with many twists and turns. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's Rear Window, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay. The story is stunningly realized, like a Picasso painting, offering multi-perspectives on the same event and demanding the viewer's participation throughout. The settings, music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast. Watch it more than once.	-2.2158766230703333	-2.0391255369070302	-1.120591447505578	-0.9303226463325699	-0.7696886149352712	-0.1630928719127912	-0.14247772927157246	-0.13669582527833274	-0.09697195181716073	0.05413929023191141	0.36924051751221815	0.4546797124673346	0.4955150799610217	0.5413294519627505	0.569305998508747	0.6060148632144562	0.6200054721589522	0.6957638482158178	0.7947351284592397	0.8040287210229883	1.198468046169307	1.2945652152714493	1.4400104998011778	1.6698107428052689	2.269518216173808	
This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy, if I can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. It's honestly that bad. I view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. Just to be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite. Other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful, but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies. I usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst, but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top, and the movie doesn't even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way. If you are familiar with the term "word vomit" then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity. Oh, and the narrative structure is ill conceived, pretentious and amateurish. It has failed on both style and substance. If you really hate someone, invite them over for a double feature of this movie and "The Terror of Tiny Town," an all midget western from the 1930's and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open "A Clockwork Orange" style. But that probably violates some provision in the Geneva Conventions.	-7.523333086982896	-3.423107284749025	-3.3006613864212473	-3.245521500384031	-3.0562330996448512	-2.3700979363187393	-2.076749377780689	-0.6503166711789942	-0.43217492147338604	-0.3707485890088998	-0.3401199596906081	-0.31877200203836464	0.34280020818332446	0.35295931501500244	0.47045577226853696	0.6243363467821813	0.6711342418152424	0.7351673544710275	0.7766811426530684	0.7983264624419588	0.837468507108106	1.2992785160679297	2.8260217436639192	4.329561717075858	8.414790286921948	
It's funny. I've seen a bunch of Fassbinder films and I have found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes--like this film. For me, it ranges from great to crap--without much in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among the "sophisticated", but I can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I will get a lot of negative ratings for this), he made too many movies too quickly and was too self-indulgent. His gay or gender-bending films (like this one) tend to be really bad--sloppily done, sometimes quite boring (such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just gross (like this film). Couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender-confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered? Show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic--then, maybe, I'd care about the films. <br /><br />I'm honestly at the point after watching this film that I might not bother with any more Fassbinder films--the bad seems to be out-weighing the good.	-2.2415112541065434	-2.1500467564739663	-1.7472508967134521	-1.6731951037364343	-1.4564234097752353	-1.0256493381909426	-0.9860670453695864	-0.8140157467356368	-0.4444750576694021	-0.42124053710517373	-0.403476226405426	-0.17207811853763177	0.07381729186581869	0.25196518163059717	0.2756971680443604	0.28391569978056397	0.34015879156145096	0.4872972182823634	0.6255923731897575	0.9148663797558809	1.5059584309790464	1.5700460001547678	1.7119495868472427	2.7472812207343353	3.965406898272273	
Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production, BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any "cliffhanger" list, utterly lacking the style, imagination, and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor, BATMAN.<br /><br />The producer, Sam Katzman, was known as "King of the Quickies" and, like his director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement. (Unfortunately, this team also produced the two Superman serials, starring Kirk Alyn, with their tacky flying animation, canned music, and dull supporting players.) The opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come: thoroughly inane titles ("Robin Rescues Batman," "Batman vs Wizard"), mechanical music droning on, and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around, either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap Halloween masks. Batman's cowl, with its devil's horns and eagle's beak, fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes. His "utility belt" is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments, from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments!<br /><br />In any case, the lead players are miscast. Robert Lowery displays little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman. He creates the impression that he'd rather be somewhere, anywhere else! John Duncan, as Robin, has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue. He is too old for the part, with an even older stuntman filling in for him. Out of costume, Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink, without one ounce of the chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 serial.<br /><br />Although serials were not known for character development, the earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast. This one offers a group going through the motions, not that the filmmakers provide much support. Not one of the hoodlums stands out, and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever, "The Wizard." (Great name!) Actually, they are led by someone sporting a curtain, a shawl, and a sack over his head, with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing. The "prime suspects" -- an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying.<br /><br />Even the established comic book "regulars" are superfluous. It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the perils she faces, Vicki displays virtually no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is none-too-bright. Unlike in the previous serial, Alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is "Mr Wayne's residence." They are props for a drawn-out, gimmick-laden, incoherent plot, further saddled with uninspired, repetitive music and amateurish production design. The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom, the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel. The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing. (The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!)<br /><br />Pity that the filmmakers couldn't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure. While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious "Batfan," one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box. They capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined.<br /><br />Now for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version!	-14.683206531058584	-7.429472980998861	-6.603646149344098	-6.4701921503867235	-5.772059698444277	-3.774315585541382	-2.76189181734817	-1.672784138710044	-0.9846002443169587	-0.7477233489502616	-0.6321154171975888	-0.4137237308937404	0.11469490597231782	0.5263522960547665	1.025876485292083	1.0328176599931913	1.0992153411213412	1.926485513554892	2.1137025170021784	2.2725812442828706	2.2975631096698477	3.2122678358592456	4.678963112418566	8.216654728725825	16.635173348312588	
1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of 70's supposed horror flicks like Friday the 13th(versions 1 thru whatever). I can't think of much redeeming here except(or can I think of anything?)The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an 'homage' to this, supposedly. But, lo and behold, one of the stupid people, have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered(again, how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this). Guess what? The murderer is at it again and we're tipped off from the very beginning who it is(so there goes any mystery whatsoever). And besides all this, where are the 'cops' and why doesn't someone call them. I can't believe this movie was financed by someone and made. You would think that by now the American people would be judged a little higher, at least in their movie-going experience, but not so by this filmmaker.	-5.264710004037263	-2.1497622041670965	-2.065760412502289	-2.0628041438961264	-2.0211600777772247	-1.9078360679033324	-1.8381741955448363	-0.3045230191930631	-0.2783803324009756	-0.15030901239952088	-0.032094813074504805	0.029373590982371314	0.07364807803843607	0.1560465938457439	0.1847072836980151	0.22824252715789795	0.2345417628196514	0.2870876731387989	0.35001843076351824	0.3538387239236904	0.39441351140479564	0.8347314661803926	2.72820511546398	2.788309534954127	5.792086969371373	
I remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager. But i wanted to see it again, because Traci Lords is now earning a living as a "serious actor". What the hell was going on in the eighties? This is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors.

Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.<br /><br />The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. She and her granddaughter Elizabeth "Lizzy" Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her fiancé, Cal Hockley and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, both of whom stress the importance of Rose's engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the Dewitt-Bukater debts: while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class, Rose and her mother are financially broke. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in third-class. But after Cal's servant informs him of Rose's whereabouts', Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again. However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a "proper lady" at tea, Rose defies him and her mother, asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Cal. After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.<br /><br />They then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg. After overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal. Meanwhile, Cal discovers Rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jack's pocket. Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck, Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. Jack and Rose return to the top deck. Cal and Jack, though enemies, both want Rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ship's first class staircase. Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.<br /><br />So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. But it has great acting, amazing effects, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.<br /><br />10/10	-7.139089198625825	-6.802966442878925	-5.165722077571503	-4.795344159008232	-3.9879294726215244	-2.9843371196416	-2.880107740874574	-2.784365348847772	-1.2828219245144739	-1.0584651575068025	-0.6222854336390665	-0.2422167077712406	-0.02294885836197694	0.07410059861265669	0.4271008804084602	0.8847218069375579	0.9894901614951153	1.5533766770339557	1.717356296838108	3.281642560985785	3.711302477483075	3.8905974863343493	5.986963118208988	8.232173537495553	15.183462257855206	
I can't believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors. I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.<br /><br />The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals, and had read this story as a novel, you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.<br /><br />Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all.<br /><br />I hate to repeat other peoples comments, but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic. The condition of those scenes chopped in, is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.<br /><br />My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie, it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget (Segal being paid 5 of that) and that the movie still came in under budget. I must concur.<br /><br />It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie, as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie .	-7.961657903636716	-4.627689008222192	-4.471342500997114	-3.937312716221054	-3.510285956367843	-1.8341354195421529	-1.3162025070105086	-1.252072232270016	-1.0793217178885994	-0.5918921197352622	-0.578273946207535	-0.4667030753168385	-0.40325793448173	-0.061157493861897574	0.29157223223074163	0.3217579727086591	0.5712417945708614	0.5811696130771614	1.0538532387058923	1.0916560349576057	1.4427711164473491	1.5277746170176396	2.797749875163588	4.533878324538831	8.39549082289076	
The Custer Legend, a la Warner Brothers Epic. There's no casting against type here, with the flamboyant Flynn as the flamboyant Custer in this rousing tribute, not only to Custer, but to the men of the 7th Cavalry. The story traces the life of the famed 'Boy General" from his turbulent days at West Point to his final fight at the Little Big Horn. Great liberties are taken with facts here, and we are presented with a Custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates. But this one is done on such a grand scale, the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in Hollywood. Down beat ending and all, this is great fun!	-1.6427484265322465	-1.3216043671279167	-0.765013628079218	-0.491279029194894	-0.34402199090449187	-0.1686996276241922	-0.03646329180411003	-0.03254244421138977	-5.899025728756668E-4	0.04011951274486676	0.060644998813140755	0.11891014565107638	0.120245187425416	0.1538102871220075	0.17181093135323913	0.22352774591424251	0.2515760367539296	0.3703338249767979	0.38490635545979734	0.5995389892479202	0.6196766015787263	0.9322505437904706	1.1977986179255056	1.8264939458856293	1.8362513736250514	
Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) gets blown up something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. He has his brain transplanted in the body of a nearly indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues who are led by wicked obsessive fellow scientist Alex Whyte (a perfectly hateful portrayal by Richard Cox). Lehman embarks on an all-out killing spree. It's up to nasty mercenary Hunter (a wonderfully loathsome turn by the divine Pam Grier) to put a stop to him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously helmed the under-appreciated slasher psycho thriller "Visiting Hours," stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable verve and maintains a zippy pace throughout, thus ensuring that this flick sizes up as an enjoyably trashy sci-fi/horror action outing. Paunchy character thesp Maury Chaykin easily cops top acting honors as disgusting fat creep Burt, who in the movie's single most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with Lehman's pregnant wife Lauren (a winning performance by the lovely Teri Austin). Stan Winston's nifty make-up f/x and Paul Zaza's thrilling score further add to the overall sleazy fun.	-1.7286934833420622	-1.3647813854556146	-0.9882277415355313	-0.6831504235034329	-0.4156757347439104	-0.39943279094925743	-0.34734516498363777	-0.2855943787287785	-0.19921358046861165	-0.19527941727777162	-0.1393336347016133	-0.13018774718946824	-0.09611958377271591	-0.05198338343329753	0.18552056775253736	0.23596314956490286	0.4483683618333202	0.46333710200530287	0.5191526663103249	0.5847657235060059	0.5875428400649807	0.7063113907985434	0.9257657161867671	1.3116341387854855	2.119935700705986	
Oh yeah, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of "worst 80's slasher ever made". "The Prey" has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine, derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before (and better), insufferable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of gore and suspense, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!). Apart from the seemingly endless amount of National Geographic stock footage, which I'll expand upon later, this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that aren't even remotely funny! The set-up is as rudimentary as it gets, with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with OTT voice-over human screams. Fast forward nearly forty years later, when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe-whacked by something that breathes heavily off-screen. This ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since. Enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds, unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer. "The Prey" is an irredeemable boring film. Apparently it was shot in 1978 already, but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isn't too hard to see why. In case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant, this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes; possibly even less. There's an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage, sometimes of animals that I think don't even live in that type of area, and they seem to go on forever. The only thing missing, in fact, is the typical National Geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals' habits. Animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at, but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80's slasher movie, for crying out loud. The last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile, with some potent killing sequences and fine make-up effects on the monster (who turns out to be Lurch from "The Addams Family" movies), but still silliness overrules  the scene with the vultures is too stupid  and the final shot is just laugh-out-loud retarded. As mentioned above, "The Prey" easily makes my own personal list of worst 80's slashers, alongside "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Don't Go in the Woods", "Hollow Gate", "The Stay Awake" and "Curfew".	-8.276990045970255	-4.418437053939083	-3.8314828336070836	-3.758003936595603	-3.414732300471469	-2.723999652820508	-1.5094811145799758	-1.0473969509416468	-0.9308289283224056	-0.24860108655009824	-0.23245477512782764	-0.17509676266280533	-0.029803025084099637	-0.014888643876639511	0.1813356232633849	0.3029203675928186	0.4936147308395089	0.8821176541924162	0.949894914405979	1.1077439821549524	1.3352664145921482	1.4021023623008007	2.7396394539734814	4.995236758527183	8.860621975581463	
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong, and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. If you have a discount theatre in your local area, wait and see it for a buck. I wouldn't even bother renting it. That would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller.	-3.1404235913324343	-1.5113712292732648	-1.3236897122117164	-1.216996296128457	-1.1201544564687618	-0.5990868800535183	-0.5820052377030906	-0.5510852475357598	-0.20611660924462713	-0.20469455300331862	-0.18357068677360683	-0.11452513404510942	0.10622145128080523	0.15214899467273302	0.27650244140634006	0.37447921956639796	0.3925042414828928	0.40166472779155227	0.4115501142930276	0.472466361037399	0.7302633542966372	0.7585828646247239	1.3911772358689523	1.4890051192086706	3.4641691094429765	
The "math" aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows. The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeservedly) waning after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock.<br /><br />The lame-ness of the "math" aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned.) In order to catch a fugitive, the "mathematician" uses some theory about "bubbles". So, he gives this long explanation that, if we have seen the suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where he might be. He does this all on a chalkboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I cant remember).<br /><br />Anyway, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three spots, and picked a point right in the middle and said "Ok, mathematically, here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive." At which point, one other character points out "Oh, that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live." Is that math? Its not even connect-the-f**k**g-dots!!! This show reminds me of the math major I used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to "support" points that every one else had already agreed on through either less-complex analysis or basic common sense.<br /><br />It just goes to show -- When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can't wait til they stick the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA... They'll use calculus, call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains, and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields... cuz hey... its all about the numbers.<br /><br />Totally ludicrous TV show.	-7.039874834867529	-2.5945496212794934	-2.5205814203510424	-2.365912245613554	-1.6465184929170973	-1.3009151742350555	-1.2733770358905736	-1.2699853720261616	-1.0276982047465626	-0.6594833690422921	-0.5807278925451056	0.025842190005642002	0.15743000205460125	0.19526107459004288	0.4913647640116209	0.5841255762529753	0.5878416508514612	0.6765228753746239	0.724285488748981	0.9038554897020324	0.9791389431149927	1.1826065585675996	2.7512155939640777	3.844729956333484	7.144780927105669

This was another World War II message to the soldiers and to the Allies to be careful about spreading rumors. These were called "instructional" cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny-looking main character called "Pvt. Snafu."<br /><br />All of us have imaginations, along with fears and what-have-you, and that's what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with "five." You can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. That includes losing confidence in your country and your cause, as pointed out here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy. That's still being done today. <br /><br />"We lost the war," declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon. Amazing how some Americans still haven't learned. This cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today. As I write this, there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some people still think the "War On Terror" is just a bumper sticker slogan. Amazing.<br /><br />The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess," uses analogies of "hot air balloon juice" here to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know the rhymes will be clever.<br /><br />Nothing hilarious here, but it wasn't meant to be. You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during World War II. People forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning.

An excellent and accurate film... McGovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy.<br /><br />Once again, McGovern brings in Christopher Eccleston, though not in as high a profile a role as he played in Hillsborough. I found this movie as accurate, well acted and well presented as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his poignant unapologetic writing. Well done and my hat is off to the writer, the actors, the production crew. A great film!	-2.209807455343904	-1.2347821254839404	-1.1886869354274232	-0.7419319497783872	-0.6664095081664746	-0.2850730562634999	-0.21827432588680945	-0.21213336722940412	-0.1655574779045072	0.027005046300063743	0.33500350361622216	0.41678883544851175	0.452969165840042	0.5569375658626166	0.6087702941128627	0.8235781375095839	0.8378423184501755	0.8732864292754718	0.9158602333934045	1.3037066756216074	1.424099083926483	1.5057524436898837	2.077036444314303	2.194303697123438	2.3842742075546672	
There are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of Pyschosis, have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence. That is the premise of the film entitled " The Night Listner." It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about Gay lifestyles. Perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his and best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. It is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called Peter (Rory Culkin). In reading the boy's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is captivated and wants to help. However, things are not what they seem and Noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and were it not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this might be comical. Instead, this may prove to be one of William's more serious performances. ***	-2.705592024427231	-2.4552674719334893	-1.7681366967796233	-1.1431933963196148	-1.1118306215834615	-0.9757924697222901	-0.4856976372310995	-0.4541375411670283	-0.33852295385793957	-0.3070254081152515	-0.09021801156196699	-0.07339977140176598	-0.012794602797530072	0.22861394335339086	0.238131440083121	0.3406926887968357	0.43286360458434386	0.46071393258765997	0.5051140407246505	0.6414463413812149	0.7396595254734364	0.9388857887810378	1.6041034935291658	2.205999000189134	4.136953162858751	
The makers have chosen the best people for the job, and set the scene wonderfully. Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it. Whether the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910s (the last), costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created. I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it's Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions. He usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode (and also nicked a story by Kipling). I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love that posh bird who plays his wife, too.	-2.8263765910519103	-2.7530800260119808	-1.1632646573906396	-1.1045295072813595	-1.074407357890601	-0.20589030369611927	-0.18068396252101673	-0.1796561149441397	-0.1457940613284252	-0.006401632253450133	0.2882371151889952	0.3894033747438275	0.39346869682071944	0.5228042741370679	0.544866724184901	0.5566515918529027	0.652758658994308	0.6591966592052473	0.8055073891109102	0.8750915374867785	0.9577245575653119	1.0437849522299847	1.6936649510842003	1.7783895462852586	2.8418463073197273	
A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS of the British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! Some of the most ravishing early Technicolor, a SUBLIME and shimmering Miklos Rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villainy of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well. Miles Malleson who plays Duprez father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose. DON'T MISS THIS ONE! Since posting the above comments, I have obtained the recently released DVD and can honestly say I'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this DVD version-The clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that I was stunned-This amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer.

Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I get involved. The works. I want to get involved. I'm spending time watching the thing. I watched the emmys last night on TV. How in the infinite world was the Empire Falls (excellent name)TV movie up for any awards? It truly had wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But how can ANYONE pretend that was an OK (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? OK direction? You know, I wish everyone the best. Really. But I thought it was totally mind-bending that Hollywood was placing this very very bad film up for so many honors. Awards? For me it was sort of a wake-up call that Hollywood is such a small insular community. Being cynical is not really my thing.

The three-part series ended last night on PBS, which I believe was its first wide exposure to an American audience. The richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points. It seems very novel to view and hear an action play employing the vernacular of Georgian England, Jane Austen's filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech. Yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene. Such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like Tolstoy or Shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian sea saga. The universality of basic human condition lies at its center.<br /><br />Narrator Talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of Benedict Cumberbatch (surely not even Dickens could beat that one!) alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability, an acting tour de force. Indeed, I cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation. That is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but to the director as well.<br /><br />The most impressive element, however, is how perfectly life aboard a man-of-war en route to Australia in the early 1800's is presented. That is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself, something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop. Anyone who has ever experienced mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly, and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming.<br /><br />This is no fanciful Pirates of the Caribbean. Some effort must be expended in attaining an understanding of its nuances.	-2.9563976714778577	-2.5759519582226424	-2.049684764011648	-1.8310892267717465	-1.022563545402303	-0.9536671597421671	-0.483451418400044	-0.45996751879469155	-0.0848017180433554	0.02307296208183013	0.10994961944784382	0.30870567421359324	0.3356334560867023	0.5919998695727304	0.6427887028619066	0.9161015625747189	0.9671824714410631	1.1273013808891326	1.2662344599077837	1.280446701953772	1.4879627908714845	1.5121491507595692	2.8929338267458733	3.7336351542898485	4.018800241668098	
Disgused as an Asian Horror, "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is actually a complex character driven psychological drama, that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares, has proved a correct one. Creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies.<br /><br />"A Tale Of Two Sisters" tels the story, as it's name suggest of two sisters Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon, who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother. From then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmother's gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior. To say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience. So I'll just leave it at that.<br /><br />The plot is very tightly written. With the characters nicely fleshed out. Ji-woon Kim's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another. Furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character. From the protective Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the visibly uninterested father to the stepmother's frantic and later deadly behavior. There is great sense of mystery, with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation. Even after watching it once, the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it.<br /><br />The actors superbly fit their roles. It is especially hard to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat. Ji-woon Kim's direction is slow paced and gripping, building up tension for the film's horroresque scenes. While few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying. The cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film.<br /><br />"A Tale Of Two Sisters" is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride. With it's strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better.	-7.122469770621606	-5.653357819207956	-3.732646484358303	-2.749417312173835	-2.534946375290612	-0.4950203278393471	-0.1883787431906241	-0.1065975240468724	0.054038263602516234	0.18255444190694328	1.1398890893123843	1.170327380432477	1.1869641921024028	1.3141395851837365	1.449874076877866	1.5785668923361742	2.1639514937681668	2.429182800587431	2.574184033524561	2.6084131971700653	2.6597893425575605	3.4237672032420376	5.0773992827387895	6.241407851512685	7.863823977615261	
Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of "Land of the Dead".<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. <br /><br />It seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art, which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre.<br /><br />We watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell-phone. They actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, I couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore.<br /><br />Some people actually consider this a "so bad, it's good" movie, they are liars. I didn't finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This is even worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT WATCH!	-4.896399011243856	-2.3481295913890374	-2.2749351886761113	-2.1995702358234634	-2.173705775132534	-1.0755192384845906	-0.6525533276586295	-0.6390966120564522	-0.3713699123616336	-0.34717816479177366	-0.33521595127295756	-0.3184952857953797	-0.2894066407247854	-0.26900395423947515	0.11174216181787935	0.1944569751739968	0.3922292282206477	0.41330855691622415	0.5057739952689894	0.5234801812800064	0.7593219443378552	0.8569865604311401	1.8205231957880361	2.338586689219328	5.027507038016261	
Some people say this show was good in it's early years! I disagree with all of 'em. The show is just plain stupid and pathetic. My mum hates it, I hate it, my dad hates it, I don't know about my sister but oh well. Here some reasons why:<br /><br />1. THE CHARACTERS: Babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid. The babies are just precocious and annoying. The grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing. The worst character is that Angelica Pickles (she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long, hard and miserable day at the office) and also that Kimi Finster who appears later on; she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt. She can't decided whither she is French or Japanese: it doesn't matter know; you are a American Citizen know and that's that! Oh, what am I talking about, all the characters from this show suck!<br /><br />2. THE STORIES: The stories are unoriginal and dumb. The make it like the babies go off on a great adventure, yeah to the back yard shed. In one episode, that little goofy brat, Tommy Pickles the Leader broke in to a television's control room and literally almost destroyed it. Don't give kids any idea to smash up normal T.V Station's control rooms (they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life). I can imagine what the broadcasters must of felt like airing this episode, they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will brake in. Sad!<br /><br />3. OVER RATED!: The show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin-offs for this. Get off! The Simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies. The show is just plain over rated! People, where is your common sense!<br /><br />Anyway, I surprised T.V Stations across the world want to air this series even off today. The show is utter junk and should have never been produced. The two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same! 2/10	-12.585628882440565	-7.169536997442353	-6.798049962843212	-5.435665732372305	-5.137868440893464	-3.9378588573970137	-3.3138617067027707	-0.8951595209389934	-0.8354098133063845	-0.6521724464615595	-0.6212086864889163	-0.5076625431436014	-0.4891283378652252	-0.20149292302648397	0.14356071759007755	0.7906902140673715	1.0262720741727471	1.115308727930115	1.8821653528741138	2.270302825793448	2.8923089824242534	2.95120511139155	3.69721599642952	8.22307742705177	13.863996778392234	
This film did a wonderful job of capturing NYC stereotypes at there best. If you want a simple, cute story however, you won't find it here. The related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close-knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at New York life in its most natural state.	-2.387498259034034	-1.7144716427283586	-1.0655216695002714	-0.49121021916971425	-0.27043657610166283	0.08394106894684156	0.08520964980419664	0.17256726372064285	0.2627563522932241	0.3112996379643749	0.3266767667346915	0.3676775696919553	0.504044379748173	0.557990609465361	0.5701212871636087	0.6224504183575075	0.6748831210621454	0.727294832763907	0.8286530191922259	1.0925176334076987	1.2391104449821932	1.2490070118905563	1.4200801972725037	1.9977556590253893	2.530463854007468	
I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.<br /><br />The story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. Moreover, the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. Not only do they all happen to be good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards Jia are very effective.<br /><br />Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action films late eighties start nineties. Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River. In between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.<br /><br />I like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs. We really feel the pain and struggle Jia is in. At the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him.<br /><br />The film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern Jia seems to be caught in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him. Because there are personal 'interviews' with the characters we feel like we are getting to know Jia not only through himself but through others as well.<br /><br />The film has a heavy feel, but scenes of Jia cycling through Bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone. So does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. This is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern Chinese film this is a strong recommendation.	-2.9877039161289494	-2.5940219944400034	-2.507804820509182	-2.480077161922675	-1.9754619476493973	-1.114686825673428	-0.64191073480269	-0.5161034828899287	-0.4408695267899735	-0.38475325758761036	-0.3768318096657351	-0.3079137127046246	-0.05800435894770084	0.042633349938989276	0.2857648871527798	0.6190237777022779	0.8718816315178127	1.0858365399687293	1.3664693023023438	1.400874721853822	1.498056241929966	1.8561121488758374	3.674466303703769	3.683152301973976	5.734091981515119	
An unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill matches Streep line for line, and take for take -- it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best, notwithstanding the intensity of his role. This engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama, portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms. The movie -- which won several top awards in Australia -- boasts not only a superlative cast and director, but wonderful and authentic Australian locales. It proves that people are the same the world over. And, after all these years, people still delight in repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all: "A dingo ate moy baby!" Including that imp "Elaine Benis" on "Seinfeld."	-4.000433124201167	-3.2031592886388287	-1.6625135641689839	-0.9595655141239992	-0.5153994571246631	-0.2375989816182127	-0.003850327865232441	0.04645552369299308	0.49454915198308697	0.5007519055429365	0.6962656507781617	0.7117833369843724	0.7298771265185445	1.1526204856047448	1.3519935086381984	1.4215904112273223	1.5273454360366883	1.6751914097427572	1.8092853861734437	1.8372345022526666	2.19762582470921	2.262025583509044	2.304019812413899	3.457421365874158	4.545149191634883	
I love this movie!! Sure I love it because of Madonna but who cares - it's damn funny!!! *ALANiS Rocks*. When I first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987, I thought it was all out hilarious! Madonna is so funny and I love her dubbed accent and wacky/funky look. The all-time funniest part is when Madonna(Nikki) screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi. And also when Griffin Dunne(Louden)trips and falls at the apartment interview scene. **ALANiS Rocks**. Madonna's character Nikki steals/shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie - her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time. "Didn't rob nothin', when you rob a store you stick up the cashier. We busted a few tapes, there's a bit of a difference" I love that!!! It's classic. ***ALANiS Rocks***. I don't know why this movie got slammed the way it did. I see nothing wrong with it - course maybe if you're a huge Madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome. Anyone out there who wants to see some funny, classic entertainment then watch "Who's That Girl?" And another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist, ALANiS will always "rock ya" completely to the end! So does Madonna in this film, and just entirely! Her acting is superb!	-4.553324323911956	-3.8287324837271677	-3.4698915080251704	-2.3125157718066824	-1.0890759228441667	-0.7972896080957653	-0.7694754276411435	-0.3584932802310468	-0.05765499005092853	-0.04956989241102505	0.32993921003843474	0.4872470304756601	0.515133108850955	0.8993777376731061	0.9169717918548725	0.9274866958608946	0.9712319720291589	1.8449177005509312	1.9697503589962706	2.1062396784033113	2.2029821449963665	2.25871561820132	4.370295338490528	5.543420644165444	5.618405017164784	
This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts. It suits them well. It's not funny, the acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. Wanna know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead "actress" Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted. Also, the writer of the show is inconsistent. In one episode, the security guard is called "sir" by one character and referred to as a woman by all else. <br /><br />Hello? It's called proofreading and editing. Do it sometime, Disney. <br /><br />Has anyone seen the promo for the new "four part bloodsucking saga"? Disney wanted their own version of the Twilight vs. Harry Potter thing. Except a million times lamer. The Wizards of Waverly Place Movie?? Think about it for a minute. Family goes away on vacation and 16 year old daughter wants independence from parents. SAME PLOT from The Proud Family Movie etc...<br /><br />What's worse is all the Emmies and ALMA'S it got. And most of the audience are some-what age's 4-13 (And no life teenagers). how many more years? before selena gomez is showing her tits?<br /><br />and Disney shows are all crap..hack writers..hack shows..destroying the minds and wallets of today's youth..	-12.448401018943386	-4.661427506659267	-4.196305783166926	-3.638839725506997	-3.32522612556232	-2.2550506188971324	-1.9341729673190071	-1.6143221210315137	-1.3603294822156764	-1.3255152161655654	-1.1899986506376008	-1.0467664170295403	-0.8705295031588647	-0.12587895427249807	0.013164165946449646	0.3378278670776358	0.38851946669408116	0.5369968593827485	0.6001296792841001	0.8489241773456511	0.8768376446082008	1.4571503145712423	4.155429605783868	4.504127018872827	9.30542175942515	
I am not a parent, neither am I a male. But I was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains.<br /><br />This is a movie teenagers should watch. Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again. I'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love, family and friendship.<br /><br />It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing. And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006.<br /><br />This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the entire family.<br /><br />I bought this movie on DVD and have watched it with friends many times.

"Wired" would have to rate as one of the ten worst films I have ever seen. The writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and I'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film.<br /><br />It fails to work either as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. <br /><br />A pointless mess with no redeeming features.	-2.0282760136492275	-1.4212592913326287	-1.3237092316388641	-1.211085572340154	-1.1985702207455813	-0.5830017031676595	-0.4942712112364853	-0.45180001010102827	-0.32000514674607483	-0.2427846909011504	-0.1993415227956071	-0.1826496036394044	-0.11120694814947163	-0.09271067653942411	-0.05744341443003498	-0.047124010289699744	0.15148311996759728	0.16657419899346362	0.39656959991491125	0.4653571090769709	0.5602971461566526	0.8554711741502365	1.1087413533194588	1.4809107291180514	2.4730681801917127	
<br /><br />"Burning Paradise" is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. When one watches the film, they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. This great film has both!! Always trying to be different than his contemporaries, Lam gives us to traditional heroes(Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan)and puts them in a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" setting. However, these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a Jet Li movie. Instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results. What makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime, there is no holding back. Too bad, they don't make films like this more often.	-3.283295116065463	-1.486959096097647	-1.3959268858487128	-1.3104225159408556	-1.1662415952549583	-1.0904002749607036	-1.0851841930070139	-0.6797333015241956	-0.4362463360032181	-0.41042727089554965	-0.13699855511028672	-0.08158121435666281	-0.04866230590859091	-0.018163932209502815	0.1009890555211752	0.2770087150073236	0.3540282897969306	0.7258009926647526	0.7806209863121675	0.7817755257944076	0.7876930999189989	0.981192422384331	1.1384529419430436	1.8769520405039237	4.2390291862834975	
This ABC straight-to-TV failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Ms. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults alike into a magical, fantastical and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first in her 'time quartet', is a beautiful take on life, the universe, and time itself. Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand. Its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Ms. L'Engle's work of art. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is mushy and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost. This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that someday an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón) makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, fake and cheap motel-room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience.	-3.009142077384382	-2.791254269595299	-2.13717952753671	-2.0589138242470537	-1.819601885253516	-1.5350614543167915	-0.9866600079759704	-0.720391261889082	-0.5121758268092291	-0.48424795173498975	-0.1477235788526537	-0.031079634958356236	0.08525940377876218	0.2888573365870412	0.3747228426437662	0.6223739401228731	0.6947972067739281	0.7898553907898356	0.7942273258899021	0.9359604242358485	1.0579035473622995	1.467717817166006	2.192082656598207	2.8088993608894604	3.8728097036034668	
"Gargle with old razor blades. Can I help it if I'm not cousin Basil? I think the piano's out of tune. Ginger Grey. This is your little snookums." Laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers. They even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap. Wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth. Adding Christine McIntyre and Emil Sitka, 2 frequent collaborators, to the mix makes it even better. Only Vernon Dent is missing. The Stooges did some great individual scenes, but this was their best overall.	-3.5909481496514406	-1.491443481349726	-1.1559016088636844	-0.9728921314145592	-0.9180077631065573	-0.6750666035451484	-0.5329798334258953	-0.4677754540488272	-0.40423366296402385	-0.225457250770128	-0.1991870695696246	-0.047982346382686863	0.19717023579141807	0.21864488528071088	0.3113280203298441	0.338305077726674	0.35600064158110983	0.4461271572490332	0.49005487805638737	0.5757167278402262	0.6915590610205712	0.8629813149165765	1.4886583546247838	1.4959425804903428	4.261000641752839	
...means "take up and read", which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.<br /><br />Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article of the same name. The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. It's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.<br /><br />Watch out for this young director...he's going places.	-3.7943503694017906	-1.568948965792249	-1.150296018527421	-1.0730546227538227	-0.6241504817267405	-0.4411125505628879	-0.27329209560613565	-0.23797345465382813	-0.1776798110647671	0.08586114441636866	0.12980240678127528	0.5416200559800887	0.6631077191205452	0.6928147418217308	0.9627611662041767	1.0254394362381536	1.0706287714268448	1.2957436944903324	1.3719970537194035	1.5370215628562476	1.6079861759797214	1.61362822221232	1.9713727683253661	2.748556545272815	3.209725562276417

I thought I was going to see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to Hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring!!! The acting in it was pretty pathetic. In fact, it looked as though some people from an Evangelic Church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members. It wasn't real-life dialog at all. I wish I had read some reviews before seeing this movie so I wouldn't have wasted my money on it. If, on the other hand, you are into the whole church scene in a big way, and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views (no matter how limiting) onto other people, then by all means, go see it.	-4.317166745338396	-2.0111570396543548	-1.6950618585191055	-1.610346337699582	-1.5420450443663003	-1.0952097419266493	-0.9749978966988608	-0.4160859996440518	-0.11112319652677133	-0.06321479710309386	-0.04651591499286136	-0.01670199429462266	0.0432004977819459	0.13540665740430016	0.18296868288064647	0.41727943749561003	0.4543259280174974	0.48563666560462876	0.6032656975652481	0.6135303690395121	0.8954833950973906	1.2777293132642429	1.96037010369947	2.2477550164613977	5.079851337183431	
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. Unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. This film only concerns itself with the period within New York City, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a fair amount of time in NYC at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "A-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70s, and here they are again, waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude. The film should have at least tried to cover larger topics, such as race, ageism, the burgeoning gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image, and the rise of the "clones", discrimination of sub-groups within the community, and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). Alas, we have none of this presented, and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories. If you were there in that decade, you'll enjoy the archival photos and grainy home-movies of the bars and discos we haunted. If you weren't there, this film will undoubtedly seem dull. It should have been so much more, but sadly, it's not. Two stars for jogging my memory...I still miss going to the Anvil!	-4.411612164094523	-2.9403473458771794	-2.316518308454474	-2.187939958672681	-1.9663361348330382	-1.5399743804360873	-1.1590634907722226	-1.0002507404689531	-0.6969863350006369	-0.48479220566366954	-0.4404524049177392	-0.08502910125616128	-0.01325308535576371	0.004436366849466598	0.1898824246078176	0.3810750279629172	0.49032527277674054	0.568063516287044	0.7103368044283503	0.81519226740603	0.9750960447965699	1.0875844798614878	1.4183657564896803	2.9590563100338922	5.5787755267756705	
I liked the film. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it. A very tense action scene that seemed well done.<br /><br />Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. Also the film is funny is several parts. I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. I'd give the film an 8 out of 10.	-3.3694631607808647	-2.5705307664802377	-1.2585891904530424	-1.0472122295950297	-0.9155317709351855	-0.3315125465687904	-0.1370365781826407	-0.021001710701831225	0.02732749738600849	0.06476283331298559	0.40814725034264787	0.4153586512281725	0.5161700198821038	0.5491820815216081	0.7199131093386514	0.7604686402820431	0.8289824578161937	0.876116529120197	0.8938229564485259	1.059073186940586	1.190673434077637	1.4513898520221604	1.5102972729336706	2.2079174622038895	3.34056952741491	
OK the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all OK. But when the movie start...well its not my first videoville movie, i watched Ghost Lake, and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here. The story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student, with specials effect that me laugh, the blood look like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop. All the movie is shot in day(very great for a movie supposed to be horror) and there like no gore(1 scene only and it look so home-made and not credible) and near no blood(it can be considered a great thing considering the look of the blood show) and 1 demon for the whole movie. The story is going nowhere , it give you the impression that it never start, there so much useless scene done only to give the movie the average duration time(when the demon search the guy in the dogs thing for about 4 minutes...) Way too much slow-mo things. Well lets just say this movie is a Z-series one and a very poor one. All cool idea lost themselves and you get a cheesy movie. It bored my all long and I'm not the guy who get bored very easily with horror movie, man i even like house of the dead and alone in the dark from Uwe Boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst director but here it look too much like some guys wanting to make a movie for fun. Plus for us french speaker(tough i understand English i prefer to watch movie in my native language) there the usual videoville bad translation. In normal movie you can barely see its not the actor speaking(you have to check on lips etc) here you just have to listen to it and you know it.

I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner executed masterfully. I am also not alone in scorning Richard Lester's Superman 2... which brings us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie, sadly it is still an absolute abomination.<br /><br />Superman's world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far. It doesn't matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader. In a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least believable manner. There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother. I condemn this movie... perhaps the slapstick in the Lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on. Super-Duper bad.	-5.512335496102679	-2.662087938189258	-2.589666756390314	-2.4188360284892894	-2.157440762853292	-1.6192884345106473	-0.8061680778788485	-0.7100330078278544	-0.5976830592050586	-0.39504369695291836	-0.3665483859185839	-0.16083549162162075	-0.08072400867749718	-0.017718732568426515	0.060924148210793616	0.11848046524908909	0.350936164128122	0.4656459289367324	0.5038716748191955	0.6799623896542792	0.7003055831955889	1.0874084128451351	2.0292892241028255	2.937796635906359	5.990297227413924	
After watching this on the MST3K episode, I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /><br />I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that, even though gas is unavailable, there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country.	-3.33156078431964	-1.3546837314749336	-1.2502132588108246	-1.2428958800937635	-1.184371951756186	-1.0968503819968305	-0.9977765085403162	-0.43160665549201077	-0.20137855756661738	-0.17015682369138774	-0.12397319673984135	-0.014369366522740686	0.0055629877961353436	0.019550124958317483	0.050488814299133516	0.10923584823359224	0.12114980740568547	0.3020020616800115	0.4009417375261538	0.4171657079921959	0.42541042788297817	0.6377848128633204	1.5398799620112493	1.5984374977484745	3.4214491936726557	
After a slow beginning, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say. It wasn't one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still OK. Morgan Freeman was just right as God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll on "THE DAILY SHOW!"<br /><br />I like director Tom Shadyac's choices of movies. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people. That's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.<br /><br />My Grade:<br /><br />7 out of 10	-2.7496663859524886	-2.4875753280054	-2.173580114540041	-1.8790621750235208	-1.2428667137472198	-0.9067230049161835	-0.648174603586267	-0.5044672226627451	-0.44992585908632243	-0.41975589624926696	-0.11727801271312159	-0.08674947046672073	0.015764004663298928	0.0771928210230318	0.2836333638967996	0.36968531921083414	0.6182997197375549	0.7512628922817426	0.796775347581359	0.8944382242818171	1.3444190082153047	1.3451024609861415	2.656963296598445	2.667569192543887	4.848670642352853	
Cooley High was actually a drama with moments of comedy. It was a reflection of high school life back in the day. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, D.C. from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in Cooley High was an every day thing at Coolidge. As a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling Coolidge "Cooley High." Getting high, shooting dice, chasing girls, basement parties, and fights, that sums up high school life for many in D.C. back in the day. I can't forget Motown because Motown music began and ended many a day back in the 70s. The hits just kept coming. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in Cooley High my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period. Thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times. Cooley High is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories, some good, and some bad.	-3.827707172173225	-2.1526149462276454	-1.6283145490315607	-1.4012342178263892	-1.177136633376989	-1.0557031576948226	-0.9727463255177955	-0.4688643284396627	-0.38073625064683464	-0.2818539776501997	-0.18378453801765937	0.0278379308660548	0.04449996013944915	0.23085537484102464	0.26536140528120744	0.4358919610887617	0.5213259078333377	0.7838728818212656	0.7848893977233828	0.8209819526034372	0.8916756844827836	0.8967996398168526	1.2030436047431576	2.371224351334764	4.5427135309933195	
Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them. As I watched this film, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching the O.J. Simpson debacle (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation).<br /><br />The Australian news media, if this movie is to be believed, devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought. It was scary to see the scenes of invasive, swarming media hordes, ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society.<br /><br />Equally appalling is the media's depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case. I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the accused are Seven-Day Adventists).<br /><br />Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.<br /><br />Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.	-3.9246838374635122	-1.852873257340576	-1.4814809642311424	-1.4716623701220843	-1.4115214390749515	-1.2167727390937246	-1.1101174781108856	-0.3720346842160405	-0.34754912461589715	0.02484975074968756	0.04432816602251863	0.19063163314388348	0.23904563518218855	0.2896217963173782	0.3037226591463722	0.4834311446240102	0.5453139822739317	0.554347189956536	0.671121804163815	0.7606967600860614	0.9925671649722861	1.0038198530170723	1.3792195369311415	2.6198499199573635	5.303401192106313	
If there is such a thing as beautiful horror, this film is one of the best in this genre. It is a horror movie, which despite not being void of gore scenes relies more on psychology and masterful building of the tension in order to create thrills. And it is one of those movies so beautifully filmed, where each scene is a full world of symbols and details, all serving the scope and genre that it can be called but beautiful.<br /><br />It is not an easy story, with two sisters returning to their father and step-mother mansion after having spent some time in a psychiatric institution. They cope hardly with the death of their mother and they try to protect a world of theirs, defending them against the adult world. So the film seems to be at its most external layer. Actually the film slowly evolves to something very different, at slow pace, but no frame is lost to convey the sense of thrilling beauty, so I will not say much more. Watch it, it is one of the best in the genre of Far East horror films that conquered recently the world cinema and it really shows that they succeeded to do it for good reasons.	-1.998392602966096	-1.5727598268968304	-1.5145538185427618	-1.002106880095924	-0.616397131869814	-0.5261191337037765	-0.47083296934314867	-0.3546847494005454	-0.27865086486592483	-0.22290255550569202	-0.08583321052949605	-4.91107245383593E-4	0.22668121823946674	0.39355716968543925	0.43006614165647983	0.5269633578637157	0.5297650804948407	0.560267983236724	0.840585063386385	0.9531185250514872	0.9746434328007283	1.2771335624287607	2.2859988154049984	2.538162191369619	3.944853766094877	
A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief's daughter, leading to much hate and violence.<br /><br />This crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at, though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level. The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white, makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it's press materials pretends it to be.<br /><br />In short, the plentiful nudity (the real reason for watching this) is good. Everything else is not. There's definitely better examples of both genres.<br /><br />More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda-stained screens of the Pussycat Theater!	-2.759286695576698	-1.683172117638004	-1.512046877995705	-1.3135791473070741	-1.2147241273913376	-0.520811486480894	-0.2976080292323995	-0.28074718570705703	-0.18795330680829198	-0.1667944095688787	-0.12940707156064996	-0.12365294506480984	-0.11616551435234587	0.08165004487111857	0.16558240448751388	0.3441397006664613	0.394522184917649	0.43601689642551245	0.4775520794827778	0.5959394788444136	0.620212203387254	0.6471320408523799	0.9298363069150872	1.6506616315781715	3.235927681744462	
A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, as Tiny Lester made his way to the WWE that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders. See the dictionary under Oops. As a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when I came out I immediately checked into H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I am proud to say I have been off the Hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since. Since this was made to bring in more fans to the juggernaut that was the WWE in Hogans hey day one has to wonder if there weren't more fans like me who turned to other past times that did not poison ones mind like this offense to celluloid did, such as huffing gas or Russian Roulette.	-3.456024137813701	-1.7882825153401911	-1.7752023473783765	-1.7525811790213015	-1.2657260144174924	-0.7606806628546847	-0.5749345192630523	-0.4845128767331928	-0.33903374296988903	-0.3018349693452353	-0.20517294319758542	-0.1489863979361497	-0.05530067767784297	0.03492800278310308	0.19469902868777664	0.2321623841649954	0.4272623205732713	0.4710686730018403	0.4741582335751411	0.5611636641492902	0.5914504017463186	0.842286489312856	1.0404976727019066	2.178606213551775	3.7627703622155386	
Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior, to stay alive in real war, to think off-line,analytically,critically and not linear. Otherwise you will come to false conclusions that Maj.Gray was dumb or unstable person. Truth is something completely different. He was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by Capt. O'Malley is that he wants her to kill him. It was his way out. He choose it. He was not man who will retire. If you've never been on a first line you can't understand it. He intentionally prepare his own suicide. First he seduced Mary Jane, than intentionally acted as a dumb, than stageed argue - shutting incident before witnesses (to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial), than gave her son a bullets (to assure he could load her gun later), came that night, loaded her gun, woke her up, put her gun in her hands, acted as he was attacking her, after shot first time he raised knife and cried "One kill" so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot. He also gave her a message with his last cry. "After first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life, this is the the only way for me to die as a man, yet to be killed by somebody I love is my choice and my only prerogative, war and army is not what you thought so far, grow up finally and save your life till you can". She left military life at the end. She did understand him. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was Col. Sam Doran with help of Lt. Tim Macy. Macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do. He took photos of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray by order of Col. Sam Doran who gave that order because Maj.Gray asked him to do that. After she refused to leave army (what Col.Doran asked her to do) Col. Doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder (he knew she cant be found quilty) instead of manslaughter (there was some possibility to be found quilty) with taken photos. Col.Doran also suppress argue-shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury. I have no doubt about outcome of that trial. Why Col. Doran did that way? Because he will do anything Maj.Gray ask him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why Mary Jane choose to go to trial? Because she was a person who have integrity, a principles. And that is why Maj.Gray choose her. It has to be somebody deserving, somebody honourable. Keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour.<br /><br />Miroslav	-10.768988395789581	-5.072661607933644	-4.682916529490592	-3.652774092722602	-3.4720456321107425	-3.421829368785857	-2.0530968434783032	-1.6402184551676662	-0.8533806436051316	-0.2977439451460186	-0.028694540698411597	-0.0271828464307958	0.15539203111342723	0.18231721942544832	0.8852771961179762	0.8873997870794831	1.1188306387176223	1.1339187040344731	1.2853141559898509	2.0557217046484024	2.5226427403843363	2.5791519004612904	4.26158477420876	4.544148771346537	11.370677625859438	
This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not feel like I wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching Galaxina. It just is not good. The jokes are almost funny, but fall short. All of them. The few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over. The production values are, well, non-existent. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it just seems cheaply made; overly so. The dialog ... well, often it is missing - many awkward silences; they are all just standing around, and it seems like someone should be saying something. The film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy - like maybe that developed after shooting started. It feels like someone's film project that they threw together the night before it was due, and if they had put two weeks into it, it could have been good.<br /><br />And I'm easy to please. I thought "Mom and Dad Save the World" was a hoot. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is well nigh unto a classic. This turkey just doesn't do it. "Space Truckers" was more believable.<br /><br />Avery Schreiber, who can be very funny, tries too hard. His part calls for a straightman, and he plays it leaning toward sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is OK in her role, but not particularly noteworthy.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, the "My watch is always slow." line was funny. I'll give this movie all the kudos it can get, it needs it.<br /><br />The space vehicle models are not bad, but they are few and are not used effectively. The space scenes are vague. No sweeping passes, no close up detailed fly-bys, not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. (The Infinity does crash land very oddly at one point.) The flight dynamics are terrible; worse than anything you've seen, they're jerky, not smooth. The initial battle is stilted and static; even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion, they trade (slow) shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle, except not as exciting.<br /><br />The aliens - imagine if all of Star Wars was the cantina scene. That many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly, no? A few are used as sight gags that work OK the first time, but not the fifth.<br /><br />Mercifully, if you attempt to watch Galaxina, you are likely to fall asleep. (I got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes, and did not feel like it was worth replaying it. If that doesn't say "It sucked", I don't know what does.) Sadly, there is a lot of potential, and this could easily have been a good movie. It would be easy to remake this and have a decent film.<br /><br />MadKaugh	-13.749189573691961	-8.415164601171083	-8.056524080013817	-6.77944878799381	-6.402323457523107	-5.472804093155813	-3.4588841964983708	-1.9955148924507746	-1.8970169522131433	-1.8234170858875314	-1.184528425615833	-0.6967347304507451	0.018491411865618396	0.06295769853615812	0.7264369565512879	0.8236960779067272	1.5088461599973206	1.6896519879309346	2.894268192453522	3.063004388063876	3.220209204086179	3.348746516983018	4.158001434977667	10.268127302676845	17.47879392261943	
LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake -- wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he's the star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I did know better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf. Which this did. And with good reason. The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE, and "journalist" Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them. He is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe I should say for his horrible acting. I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Just awful. The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard, looking like nothing so much as a hobo.

If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj) then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards.<br /><br />If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film. The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations.<br /><br />The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film. That itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times. And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie.<br /><br />In short IT'S THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a better enjoyable movie than this.<br /><br />One cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved. The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song. The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good of all in the lot. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar.<br /><br />Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this : Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location (probably Ladakh). In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car. I am still thinking who wrote this.<br /><br />If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts. You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD. Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved? So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan.<br /><br />Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out. As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie, the actors and the production house both.	-13.040456520296567	-6.175319674801459	-5.690646370658567	-4.971591104382002	-4.369389853884303	-3.7586789479035905	-3.106310598672743	-2.531857115043625	-1.1299003055260528	-0.8447377463885231	-0.6459393118686384	0.03344512831583856	0.0645860987742801	0.2777984608635857	1.0196891633730225	1.3240559664568012	1.3613850573904407	1.4167665703933965	1.967533943571249	1.9840191501160525	2.1773283314321605	2.5961863245784125	4.019398394390517	6.522281155312376	13.863456458903459	
All internet buzz aside, this movie was god awful. I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything. Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller/horror movie, and they completely missed. There were only a few good parts, and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash.

I am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism. I think it is a nice little comedy and really funny. The humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and I like it. I also like Madonna's character and I do not agree that she played herself. She has created a character and a sympathetic one. <br /><br />My favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where Madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love. The humour in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and perhaps it is not everybody's cup of tea. But it's their problem, not of the film. <br /><br />I found this film wholesome and sunny. In fact, the day I first saw it I was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day. And Madonna can act. Just take off your glasses of negative thinking.	-3.4357167997336333	-1.927939031475824	-1.5290495312586032	-1.3755041709103875	-0.6069226005011342	-0.3062370005781998	-0.23479774661086356	-0.17196938611335977	0.08819546572787682	0.3035318858918221	0.307287745709234	0.5229232329601138	0.5275758356815741	0.5559187187497618	0.5699606373581764	0.691067191332336	0.7288123979954635	0.8667978835650453	1.0941165655880314	1.155958451331363	1.156087273949898	1.7022105125743392	2.962268484884715	3.807377534901872	4.6043345516371454	
But the fun is in the journey.<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. But the point is that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways.<br /><br />The dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts, and over the top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold, the actress there deserves honorable mention! For those that panned it for being predictable - If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it has been worth every effort along the way.<br /><br />Great date movie, great movie for a happy cry...	-5.090529679315146	-2.9278781879025324	-2.1444473792480023	-1.6006587388237976	-0.9977776284820284	-0.5524162069222573	-0.49984192809247907	-0.059333510690105076	-0.04357991774367534	0.21536103283035746	0.23263363319838665	0.6023774442201644	0.9809429978823726	1.0936707802880838	1.331891698407564	1.3658998857653888	1.736251070160367	1.8100381881867804	2.060467170798729	2.116454508465831	2.19524353424468	2.5616685814056135	2.9190710228591943	3.470794274898208	4.66207607783581	
*** REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I'll make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edison's Police Force. LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault Tactics). He's teamed with an "on-the-edge" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs. I don't want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.<br /><br />You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance are pretty lackluster. The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott. He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me. LL Cool J is terrible in this film. He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film. The ending is far from satisfying.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film. I'm putting it on Ebay this weekend.	-8.03756299328651	-4.708413607652931	-4.395976198579234	-3.394987966965001	-2.8384302854650305	-2.7711124901143522	-2.009977614826428	-0.5429901296843243	-0.48590479813225573	-0.4719069912337406	-0.4354782064658373	-0.4054674504961696	-0.002401500956616426	0.1387492115163251	0.22721889586958577	0.9493740361744352	0.9591078939701104	1.2999940646671082	1.428410824936647	1.431792907582523	1.885334397670257	2.1787399899615396	2.207292931403833	5.732805238833737	9.680186548463633	
This is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10. As a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10. And I think I am actually being very charitable.<br /><br />What was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest "boy" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, Indian-foe, Indian-friend(?), and national hero. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant/Lee, and Sherman/Jackson. It is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined. Yet to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best recalled figure in our history's military annals to lose his last battle (I can't really think of a similar one - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and the Second World War). <br /><br />Custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled them in this film. But even in 1941 the legend was still potent. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived George until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later. Custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of World War II looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have fully understood this and approved it.<br /><br />So we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic. Although almost pushed out of West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year. You see, most of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee down) was southern, and joined the Confederacy. The Union needed every northern "Point" man they could find.<br /><br />Custer's Civil War career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of General - In - Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other eastern front warfare. But he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's buddy Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war. In particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederacy in the Shenandoah Valley. It also hit Custer hard on a personal level (his close West Point friend, Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederacy and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded, Custer sat with Ramseur all through the latter's last night alive).<br /><br />Following the war things fell apart. He wanted to make his brevet - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't, as it was a battlefield promotion). They only had a Lt. Colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier. He tried to play politics, making the error of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most Northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He supposedly admired the Indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the West), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial. Later, during the 1870s he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading posts for profit. It ruined Belknap, and left a black eye on the Grant Administration. It put him into the doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career. Then he was sent on the final Big Horn Campaign. And immortality arrived.<br /><br />That career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical? Should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007? Would we like that done to us in a hundred years? Certainly it could happen, but I'm not sure we'd like it.<br /><br />Custer (1941 style) fit Flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a "dance" performance in any of his major films. His final movie with Olivia De Haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character. In support actors like Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy). As an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.	-13.34794882182474	-7.441001882671039	-5.709214660461763	-5.31423933333885	-5.236185451861929	-4.458652869280299	-4.364010701039792	-1.5397952484213395	-0.6198000427636141	-0.4889219357652869	-0.32358422643571005	0.6536400943263485	0.8923782043089588	1.0356973608956102	1.068822887741847	1.168752908174424	1.2686529819973607	1.5305445600037642	2.347270955545511	2.8248113025736368	3.6710391235921853	3.825581702956726	3.9313829584894076	8.316786679560153	17.886517439714485	
A sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting, even though they are marrying other people. Maybe a little trite in that the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Not anything heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for the guys - sell the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - sell them the sappy romance, everyone wins!	-1.0864687625857326	-0.8339390671175047	-0.6722606798672129	-0.48856571512819913	-0.39578508373725263	-0.3156979404264423	-0.25273388601068575	-0.24597158960284993	-0.165137654384159	-0.02472175882366391	0.029553911556372527	0.04378902474171315	0.06750960174767165	0.07010924885016008	0.08004775636489705	0.17908484202301905	0.2297187438385492	0.2515218192191118	0.2566737783230601	0.3764938241429132	0.42898527644608503	0.43104074952322885	0.70633607056472	1.0529282157648505	1.5936547355848474	
Anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development. I personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts (e.g., A Tale of Two Sisters, Kairo, etc.). Whatever the type of horror film one personally likes, there are only a select few that really scare you. Noroi is one of them.<br /><br />This is a documentary-style movie, which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named Kagutaba. The premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research. What results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing, despite the fact that the story itself is fake.<br /><br />Some have compared Noroi with The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is the documentary style. One obvious difference between the films is that Noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources. For example, the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the film, a clip from another character's home video introduces that very same strange occurrence. The viewer's memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine. Another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one. In fact, her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking. Later on, however, that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. This is intelligent film-making indeed.<br /><br />Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi provides not one, but two very long finales, the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema. I do not say such things lightly. It totally wrecked me in a wonderous way.<br /><br />Other aspects of film-making are well done. The legend and ritualistic background of Kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. The only over-the-top performance comes from a guy who's supposed to be crazy anyway, so that's expected. The cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders. Japanese films are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were awesome. In some cases they create an other-worldly feel (e.g., the static interference or the first finale) but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic (e.g., the second finale).<br /><br />When all is said and done, Noroi goes down as the scariest film I've ever seen. I would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like Noroi does. See it now.	-7.811483514378292	-5.659732198614452	-4.37314302607347	-4.275481725248918	-2.860576685085417	-1.7192910598331985	-1.49067177342293	-0.9341038763237783	-0.8145465184742116	-0.8126228322202442	-0.43178761399015003	-0.3543981549308929	-0.3142659899959097	0.014347148580495114	0.3758137339908418	1.0509497462874617	1.1224722613806324	1.3590185806057238	1.8545135288519914	2.3476242881220686	2.526262578657479	2.8507838161694345	4.8527538813136575	6.504243489905524	11.134794088122197	
The movie itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable. What really gives me the creeps though is that people like Justin Timberlake even get cast for movies, and on top of that for movies like this one. I have to admit I had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the very instant he appeared I was just plain annoyed. The voice is crap, the face is a bad rip-off of Legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them. Said to say, I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I give this a 4. <br /><br />I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast... and cannot believe it.	-3.6420520291009733	-2.67459120515546	-2.5478647813892548	-2.464025803095561	-1.7491942263485816	-1.1132245061735409	-1.097197836598613	-0.686878848397653	-0.6134797745383411	-0.29878898074060645	-0.11423541413045574	-0.061787934636391054	-0.04371934322921425	0.0256864163092263	0.13241710597728168	0.3318694034700834	0.4064060628827141	0.6857653112677929	0.806646403717479	0.8414724028439307	0.891450666439153	1.732175882828247	2.102575133238987	3.347780664280058	5.022801441908279	
Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in August of 1939. So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line didn't change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.<br /><br />The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.<br /><br />Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.<br /><br />Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.<br /><br />Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.<br /><br />The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Davis's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist background. <br /><br />His suspicions are quite correct, it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.<br /><br />Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.<br /><br />Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.<br /><br />Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other anti-fascist classic, Casablanca. <br /><br />Though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern anti-fascist message that bears repeating infinitely.	-8.414636940426913	-4.884943562247948	-4.222750121460829	-3.2736014055662648	-2.772299772095788	-2.7588570841375275	-1.2144459441661848	-1.03850838029205	-1.0073711565660508	-0.9182734846030967	-0.30234938330254985	-0.05066461931622048	-0.01641508851632217	0.003002139494700587	0.4240233700829987	0.46298509414495026	1.5605133614709226	1.6541521569599316	1.7177643180001498	1.8148626838624375	2.3125143975316593	2.5784113560886666	2.6988117385554675	4.487003755423492	9.52495335862327

This is the best 3-D experience Disney has at their themeparks. This is certainly better than their original 1960's acid-trip film that was in it's place, is leagues better than "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" (and far more fun), barely squeaks by the MuppetVision 3-D movie at Disney-MGM and can even beat the original 3-D "Movie Experience" Captain EO. This film relives some of Disney's greatest musical hits from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and others, and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show. This is a totally kid-friendly movie too, unlike "Honey..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"	-2.6184608445237876	-2.011115242222499	-1.4030579236885865	-1.097742279754123	-0.7542444869347465	-0.7339601432550152	-0.149044757338132	-0.09551187262629776	-0.007848821378112922	0.10748459043718794	0.15540827619435643	0.2804287722023981	0.34508103103192467	0.5410234294993413	0.5594589491756001	0.8334992029970792	1.0423168783904018	1.0607249595525985	1.2049959399320902	1.2337061150770154	1.273707088986699	1.5470253043782924	1.6751957892835414	2.087404225190132	2.7036109218470705	
This was a very nice soft-core movie for both men and women. Plenty of nudity/sex, but without the overall raunch you'll usually find. They could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning. Trust me guys, if you want to get your woman in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure lovely Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please PM me! I'd love to know. The photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but nice, sweet natured and romantic. At the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. I give this 7/10!	-3.12515946319853	-2.4241382983177022	-1.9100718050458356	-1.9019740739148985	-1.174864164049959	-1.1734752467271066	-0.9098461498872843	-0.8028539540689801	-0.3386204273456297	-0.26419738639666573	-0.10994634340538892	0.053711418446832776	0.39933761065848483	0.44162444505734066	0.6318180055770307	0.7002565713574653	0.8109729732791775	0.8480295426483849	1.2070228190740726	1.2208666993757868	1.2227124270564458	1.491496193828126	3.032258403595992	3.1937181200682168	3.606961572150155	
This movie is a perfect example of Barkers cinematic gifts to the horror/ monster genre. I thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and comic books (or actually, the comics may have come second, I forget). This movie was made for Barker fans. It helps to have read the book beforehand, but isn't that important if you can follow a film. I saw to anyone who is on the fence about this film, read the book, then re-watch the film. You might find a new respect for the movie. I came to this movie a big fan of Barker already, and having read the book prior, loved the film instantly. There are great cameos, makeup, writing, directing, etc in this film. This movie does something that most monster/ horror movies fail miserably at, show the monsters. They are there in full color, not hidden in shadows, and taking most of the screen time. Unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature, this movie celebrates the grotesque, and casts them into the forefront as the good guy. Two thumbs up Clive. We're waiting for the Thief of Always :)	-4.117655877108298	-3.0523701036498223	-1.773718858353843	-1.3586741172729697	-1.2147113571001795	-0.21147853131196978	-0.021642812494549114	-0.02032631692040416	0.057959666148076266	0.14552138970072012	0.14688587311885398	0.3086765970901879	0.3474078026127512	0.4235301981948327	0.4618049886335331	0.4992440043664045	0.7022814891835072	0.7606046680681909	0.9891146244920997	1.0583771416036774	1.3121245302947573	1.56733277802512	2.8527133926857284	3.0953321783363577	4.116077360654722	
First Off, I am a huge fan of Robert Blake, always have been.<br /><br />This movie came on Movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me & of course the star. But after watching it I was left more confused than I was before it started.... There are some good scenes, and I thought they would lead somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be an "anti-cop" "anti-buddy" "anti-hippie", pretty much "anti-everything movie", with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere.<br /><br />Robert Blake is great as the lead, well as great as someone could be with this bad movie, I am still a huge fan of Mr. Blake and love his acting even in crap like this...But this drug induced 70's tripe, well... better stay away from this one...And, that ending, what a pisser.	-1.332812073860027	-0.8698837041370198	-0.8596680745509344	-0.7785460299071467	-0.5780128964023109	-0.473837862927109	-0.31968931533340383	-0.30030446922859577	-0.2095317885049702	-0.1858601233927439	-0.15792088425478734	-0.06379903220958319	0.02058564090262499	0.04454789377503937	0.09555230280174204	0.09846658095564492	0.17750201614611405	0.255686361328717	0.3183579339621353	0.33349769722751305	0.40870430464906565	0.4197873086514678	0.4374124983831607	1.194902879226949	1.8095240716076093	
When at the very start of the film Paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the Argyle family's house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller; an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around. But as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably.<br /><br />"Ordeal by Innocence" is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment. Nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (wether you guessed or not).<br /><br />Donald Sutherland, Cristopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from her good performance in "Ryan's Daughter") just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either.<br /><br />You won't miss much if you skip this one.	-2.881556324130146	-2.005328897586301	-1.8919656873112922	-1.6962373878518635	-1.5129481716962652	-0.5814619450835895	-0.44717992473863405	-0.43537754371242915	-0.3865505664919967	-0.22075779600223594	-0.16024667585002167	-0.1156820194748598	0.016487645353634454	0.1327220060390788	0.15334269035882908	0.23973046344403942	0.2505046370864288	0.29564635561609287	0.518800884027683	0.5322066729782962	0.5990728734173973	0.75494193899927	0.8198280412633101	2.187805010305222	3.564704043986041

As an engineer, I must say this show's first season started out very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible, and the relationships portrayed between the Eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge.<br /><br />But after the first season, the show started degrading, heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real.<br /><br />The involvement from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode, but in the end, this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade C action thriller and CSI style cop show.<br /><br />If you are gonna watch it, go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second. Thereafter I would not waste my time. Myself, I gave the show up midway through season 3.<br /><br />Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars<br /><br />Let's sum that up to 4 stars. Since Charlie doesn't know his math anymore, I won't bother with the correctness of mine either.	-4.9871944206159915	-2.357980613820452	-2.309925180219466	-2.1056998629560875	-2.0664631516019734	-1.2045603603454045	-0.7236252137057335	-0.6834258826873814	-0.47537004365993946	-0.3476363918366679	-0.292630407474495	-0.2373347550473031	-0.18170689572194318	0.07216686671805798	0.23889558082800155	0.25208198670635207	0.34599186381037306	0.5171176078353996	0.6834082030376706	0.8940836630290637	0.9048829592579269	1.0279382610564634	1.110982790302014	2.7102877267048484	5.355438882132638	
I guess those who have been in a one-sided relationship of some sort before will be able identify with the lead character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50 year old woman who is still in the pink of good health, as demonstrated by her daily, grinding routine of waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work, where she has to lug bottles of Megmilk in a bag in a route around her town like clockwork, to exchange empty bottles for full ones, and to collect payment and issue receipt. And there's always be that one delivery stop that's right at the top, needing to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve customer satisfaction.<br /><br />And peculiar enough, that stop happened to be a stop delivering to a man with whom she has been in love with for almost all her teenage to adult life, and not having the product appreciated, but poured down the sink. Having gone to the same school, we see that they're not talking to each other, and in their daily life always seem so close physically, but yet so far away. There's no eye contact, save for cursory glances by chance, and little acknowledgement of each other's existence. We learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together, where clear attraction between the two was hampered from developing further by the earlier generation.<br /><br />While I thought Minako was an interesting woman in herself, one who has kept her feelings suppressed for so long, one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do. If I read that the original Japanese title means "At some time the days you read books" and it's accurate, I felt the movie had a wonderful finale with that shot of her well stocked bookcase, likely alluding to the fact that she's not alone after all, and had probably fallen back on her crutch of sorts to deal with the pain of being alone, and back to a lifestyle which she had already been accustomed to for 50 years. Besides immersing herself in two jobs, she has those books which serve as a form of escapism, and occasionally pens little sweet nothings to song dedication shows on the radio.<br /><br />Yuko Tanaka did a commendable job as the emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love none other, her object of affection, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character who has more facets. Staying true to marriage vows, he spends significant amount of screen time looking after his sickly bedridden wife (played by Akiko Nishina), while juggling with his job of social welfare in the Children's Affairs department in City Hall. I felt that as a childless couple, the job provided him a means to care, not for his own, but for other people's children, the troubled ones who are neglected and left to fend for themselves. In a rare moment of rage, we see how he angrily chides such wayward parents who don't appreciate and wastes their children's lives away.<br /><br />The story by Kenji Aoki provides little quirks to make its characters appeal and successfully attempted to provide a lot more glimpses and dimension into them as well, such as how Takanashi is a hopeless Haiku poet despite being a member of the Haiku club, and supporting characters such as the aged Minagawa couple, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) lent some comical though sad moments as he slowly turned senile, while wife Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) narrates and brings us through this love story of a single woman at 50. Even Akiko Nishina's performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of arresting, with her character's enlightened state of knowing her husband's past, and making unselfish, and painful decisions in her sickly state.<br /><br />It's what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic movie, sans young, nubile leads as star-crossed lovers, but with all other elements in place such as romantic set ups, love songs and those quintessential restrained but affectionate behaviour. I thought the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when unrequited love gets consummated, but director Akira Ogata managed to steer clear of the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, though the story did call for some obvious plot development into the final act that you can predict, especially if you're already way past your Romance Movie 101.<br /><br />Not being your average lovey-dovey story, I thought The Milkwoman told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme, and frankly a recommended romance movie (though told at a measured pace) if you're in the mood for some bittersweet loving, reminiscence, and seeking to live without regrets.	-8.62061716262333	-4.393624602702462	-4.038872274949764	-3.9415057660151427	-3.5276459968831553	-2.364171239864266	-1.9818194554258843	-1.8131589067296165	-0.5049753867419939	-0.3586737292805834	-0.2864222563039499	-0.13288474005374995	0.024953053948230094	0.08102205281087332	0.6048390091935688	0.7546885756024279	0.8451792354667539	1.20269347274347	1.3585105850729982	1.4484551560295782	1.5072160590637642	1.958236214745065	2.2400094454369124	4.571399317556303	9.53350257134284	
This forth film in the "Angel Guts" saga, which at only a few minutes above an hour (it just feels much longer) , is also the shortest, which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most uninvolving of the series.Nami, a department store clerk, is interested in another part time job. Her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called 'red porno'. But when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her. And she gets some unwanted admirer. Oh yea and she likes to masturbate ..ALOT. Using various household items. The wall to wall sexcapades masks a lack of discernible plot and pushes this one far too much into exploitation territory, not unsurprising though given that the Director of this one is Toshiharu Ikeda ("Evil Dead Trap", "Beautiful Prey"). Perhaps his sensibilities just weren't suited for an Angel Guts film.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />DVD Extras: Commentary by Jasper Sharp; Bio/Filmographies; a 36 minute interview with Toshiharu Ikeda; Original Sleeve art; and Trailers for this and 4 other Angel Guts Films (High School Co Ed, Red Classroom, Red Vertigo, & Red Porno) all available in Artsmagik's Box-set, but for some reason the 6th film "Angel Guts: Red Flash" is not in the set	-3.804541643439302	-2.012437124233199	-1.769469546037802	-1.742840578257623	-1.2155360564462514	-1.1545529598163888	-0.76644025089737	-0.5328057900451071	-0.32021185869493735	-0.2890296586441021	-0.2019037681106103	-0.19702829251956777	-0.03853955364847027	0.0024406946020265885	0.3058588714870666	0.3111539744675287	0.3597255080880739	0.3975464174429244	0.4525846605572512	0.46484647520544964	0.5342001271889841	0.5744690732441867	1.0716255216232025	2.0064245568635397	3.7317836255015697	
I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a movie had been made in the past, but I'd never been able to locate it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /><br />As I watched the movie, I had the highest of hopes. As the film went on, I became more and more despondent. They had botched it badly! Never had I been so let down by a favorite book-to-film adaption. I understand that films can't stick strictly to a book, but they don't need to change things for the sake of it! Most, if not all, of departures from the book were totally unnecessary! <br /><br />I kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie. Well, it wasn't just me. Nearly every single one felt the same way--cheated out of the great story that Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created! <br /><br />Why, they wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the star wars movie? Why couldn't Calvin's hair have been red? Why did Mrs. Which not have the proper "witch-like" outfit that was such a clever play on her name? Basically, we all wondered--why did nearly every single detail have to be changed? <br /><br />I have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make. I am still waiting for that movie. This one was A Wrinkle in Time in only the broadest of senses. I'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task!	-6.904940914556025	-3.9859364899680174	-3.3487769168983466	-2.5740545692945296	-2.5236217192638106	-2.106960163529021	-1.8769105330236782	-0.6651352392381358	-0.3487967841256787	-0.2623457502355264	0.0392808477367725	0.0990551098485169	0.2091129919469169	0.6042953128819784	0.6621800258935192	1.0485645295379518	1.0853702953391418	1.2311060842141683	1.384755400576132	1.4509530942200524	1.4694928321486087	1.4840496664573026	2.8491891027419305	5.031690088718559	9.644330176285697	
The film's executive producer is none other than that messenger of peace thru transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the director's father. I wonder what David's guru, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would have thought of this production. The hypocrisy here is as repugnant as is the film itself. It's a safe bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, Phoenix serial killer and devotee of recreational violence, would have loved every minute of it.<br /><br />I doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft; on that level it's quite good. But on a moral level, it's the most disheartening movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />SPOILER COMING<br /><br />I guess it's the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most. Morally-numb Generation Xers learn a craft and a little post-modern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the arts-and-entertainment industry; and here's the result: a film which wallows in human suffering, injustice and carnage, much of which is witnessed by a nine-year old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of recreational-violence killers who, at the end, ride off into the sunset.<br /><br />NO MORE SPOILERS COMING<br /><br />For whom are films like this produced? Narurally, sadists are going to adore this - why wouldn't they? But who else? As I noted above, there's some really good film craft here, but good craft can be applied to any subject matter. Why apply it to stuff like this? Also, the movie is very suspenseful, but that's not because of the graphicness & grossness of the violence; it's suspenseful because it's well-directed & well-acted. I'm sure the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock could explain this much better than I can.<br /><br />So what has been put before us here? And above all, why? <br /><br />Yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty, even evil place, but shouldn't we dissent when an "artist" makes it her/his business to rub our faces in it? Or worse still, to stick it in the faces of those nine-year olds who will, one way or another, end up seeing this on home DVD? <br /><br />I hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids. Yeah, I know - dream on, bernon...	-7.322217287373401	-4.1290180907018845	-3.2634827941551126	-2.9643138996098877	-2.300151120522633	-2.2117175893598446	-1.9841024115792596	-0.5945311696135545	-0.3805965951237564	-0.3754509513284766	-0.35651148210655526	-0.03695343660080991	0.2371550344137979	0.3268597194187416	0.45414705873624406	0.8047494866566554	1.0475308857336547	1.0561643302931032	1.377426909154882	1.706193464374697	1.8355283483760276	2.0431166476268436	2.108591298871782	4.974804789016563	9.929125095100131	
Yesterday I watched this tv production, and I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. I felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the "turn off"-switch.<br /><br />The movie is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets a lot of AIDS-patients, and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations. However this movie has problems showing both sides, it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients, and sometimes we see flicks from his home, but we don't get much. The difficulties to show more than one part of Verghese's life doesn't get any better with the poor acting from Naveen Andrews, a man I (hopefully) can't see in any good future movies.<br /><br />I believe it got 7,6 because of the subject (taboo?), but I'm sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market. Stay away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10.<br /><br />	-6.427139296531645	-3.5425476449980513	-3.35751152091107	-3.3433192509492837	-2.9968897129449714	-1.2307866882826033	-1.188015563815851	-1.1444633841683995	-0.9854677325395924	-0.9443900821113976	-0.6217438914447132	-0.42494354668517015	-0.4006826147127971	-0.36551728761305513	-0.15104552703612534	0.5276881069581126	0.8026176335945846	0.8641745256189198	1.092492678173231	1.2918427559624892	1.4800040715155356	1.593122772937718	2.3011871248569804	3.855963092761311	6.509073487235319	
The Beauty. The Terror. The Poetry. The Horror. The Innocence. The Guilt.<br /><br />Maybe that's just about all I should write in this comment for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I myself didn't even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when I went into this movie. I just took a look at the nice cover-art, didn't even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into DVD-player. I only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended.<br /><br />The DVD-cover read "The Most Frightening Film since THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Though the frightening-part might be right, you can forget about the rest, because the only thing A TALE OF TWO SISTERS has in common with those movie is... a ghostly apparition with long black hair. It's even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous Japanese movies, because this Korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others.<br /><br />This movie simply is a small masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without telling anything about the plot): The movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise-twists. And just when you think you've had the conclusion (whether you get it or not, that's irrelevant for the moment) and you think the movie will end... this movie goes on a bit longer. The cinematography is amazing, using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night. The camera-work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive, if not, innovating angles. Some shots are pure poetry (e.g. the top-shot with the two sisters at the lake). It all looks very stylish. There are only four main characters, but the intrigue surrounding them is intense. The story itself starts a bit slow, but there's a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting. There was even one scene (when the girls took off towards the lake) that suddenly had me remembering Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES. But when the horror kicks in, it's quite effective. There are also a few successful surprise-scares in it. Damn, I jumped right up from my sofa. The musical score is great, and at times when it's not supposed to be scary, I couldn't help but noticing that it had sort of an Italian feeling to it. A bit strange for a Korean movie. But nevertheless, a great score. So much care went into every detail of this film, including a perfectly balanced surround sound.<br /><br />I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit. It's more a mysterious horror-drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level. No matter how you look at it, this is Asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest. It might not be gory, but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed. So if you haven't seen it yet, then find a copy, pop it into your DVD-player, go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's 110 minutes running time.<br /><br />There, I hope I did a good job praising it without spoiling anything.	-9.287727704446201	-7.618259286485769	-5.7535178810356875	-4.527878866824737	-2.460861444588886	-0.8613758159353028	-0.8079952319176873	-0.7991918563694899	-0.5988607826949582	-0.40678147960566674	-0.14112858262722036	-0.04214627971343124	0.028590908903808845	0.44261411958516594	0.86894766526177	1.3572370221472507	1.6914305640617373	1.8432247211025978	2.5091623082766867	2.5588753080828663	2.8582090580206	3.743901412159911	7.143406738333916	9.127256494099079	9.50097029679026	
Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies. With a slightly toned down Carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self, Carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic, tearfully somber moments. Elements of Jim's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie. This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script. While still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste. Eight out of ten stars.	-2.4959800829930137	-1.9347822816825975	-0.7569431312497841	-0.6518276315163652	-0.3590739921189157	-0.2555529340831445	-0.19827972733664462	-0.06932482585677421	0.30710160159548083	0.38204246604636877	0.41611797393440064	0.4234510723483946	0.43357138029645825	0.5585308454653468	0.6526756465679229	0.655403838504455	0.6848904726241383	0.7703700400127168	0.7813178855917233	0.9493936565730234	1.1817637778619094	1.191694884199032	1.6145575807979844	1.6822176182066124	2.672291522656477	
Walt was particularly fond of quality. So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited, roughly acted (even for family fare!) mess of a movie? THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And, since it is Disney, you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously. But THE BIG GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, pulls in another terrible performance on his resume.<br /><br />Kids with too much time on their hands in small town Elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer. The kids don't know a thing though. And, gracious for us, we get to see Steve Guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end.<br /><br />The speed up camera work does not work. THE BIG GREEN is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along. Kids are not idiots. They will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage. Guttenburg, for once in his life, should have turned down an offer to join this movie. Also the pretty Olivia d'Abo should have called this one off too. THE BIG GREEN can be known as 'The Big Bomb.'	-7.606046441807227	-3.661208239681299	-3.0050789166375154	-2.6493122930874753	-2.294803113053613	-2.249188957019801	-2.1290593829669935	-1.2165268842911525	-0.8521263170627	-0.29996807531781267	-0.2570469189924383	0.10031287691543164	0.1982819347416514	0.22330210131313424	0.5785167271467525	0.6725960466559591	0.8052255143205428	0.9967545106153781	1.3562999975356869	1.5351394768502125	1.7575476940694834	1.9501080043394352	2.6906081959460897	4.107948610627309	8.285917866299457	
Although not a big Coen brothers fan, I am an admirer of their dark humor films like 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing.' I have been much less impressed by their other comic mode, goofy-camp (or is that Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy.'<br /><br />'O Brother' is basically an episodic series of in-jokes without much point, and not all that much humor or cleverness either. As most reviewers have noted, the film's plot is very loosely  and, as far as I could tell, quite arbitrarily  based on The Odyssey. Its main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an 'adventurer' like his Homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife Penny to a suitor. Of course, we don't discover that this is what the Clooney/Ulysses character really wants until long after we've stopped caring. And what does Homer have to do with "Cool Hand Luke" chain gangs, Ku Klux Klan meetings a la "Indiana Jones" cult gatherings, a disbarred lawyer's vocabulary, a talent for blue-grass country music singing, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a Clark Gable lookalike hairdo, and other random and sundry character traits and encounters? I leave that for others to discern.<br /><br />The allusion to Preston Sturges' 'Sullivan's Travels' in 'O Brother's' title is equally pointless. Yes, viewers familiar with the Sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious Depression movie Sullivan abandons Hollywood and comedy hoping to make. And they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot/scene riffs (e.g. hopping freight cars, and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie). But so what? The Coen brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art-for-art's-sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art. They obviously fall into the former school, but that doesn't seem to motivate the reference in the slightest. Is it an homage? If so, why make it? I like post-modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but it's a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent  and not just an arbitrary concoction.<br /><br />This screenplay is simply a silly mess. The only consistent, and consistently pleasing, element is the folk/country music soundtrack. It doesn't have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but, considering the rest of the film, that's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack CD.	-9.494719978348437	-4.656950013579772	-3.528134739792907	-3.5183237959366105	-3.1804819710837986	-3.0262013231200315	-3.020411254733201	-0.9948577502096976	-0.9932070379431883	-0.8181313258927422	-0.47223037024477627	3.8877470292526806E-4	0.2658289254058813	0.4730711595383951	0.7382663532260318	0.8467589719741311	0.8862142510368824	1.0168750274889335	1.0314312213399632	1.13949719395886	1.480726994957332	2.1542692073385474	3.8059076572340107	5.101869946493637	10.986341124923923	
As a history of Custer, this insn't even close (Custer dies to help the indians? I am sure the other members of the 7th Cav weren't consulted in THAT decision.) But as a western, this is fun. Flynn looks, and acts, the part of the dashing cavalier. And the "Garry Owen" is always nice to hear!	-1.7318002709139886	-1.1287625248259585	-0.601219525129006	-0.45197671570674586	-0.3140339013352438	-0.27854437776799307	-0.27002770140350696	-0.21289446906828885	-0.16539691338989634	-0.014166516389583703	0.04649035597888039	0.053067127548714066	0.07485545287763454	0.15858085730529053	0.19628882239551163	0.23157884257237638	0.36489893023922815	0.3844489183192611	0.39515370374444636	0.3982353467089679	0.5260090174853701	0.6665894542054307	1.0374876610239847	1.3891909587661218	1.6348578338499293	
The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a "night to remember." It re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. Why so criticised? I have no idea. Could/will they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible.<br /><br />The director no doubt had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. Yes I'm not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting. <br /><br />The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend herself "TITANIC" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great. <br /><br />I guess it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something Hesterical, and a film to idolise for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark.

Most of Wayne's B westerns are kind of fun in a naive way, but this one really stinks. The editing is terrible, and the direction and pacing is completely lethargic. Most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper, and I was bored. Sorry, Duke, but this gets a 1.	-2.08668493546286	-1.3928455661717145	-1.3542729758445242	-1.3152852223873965	-1.3126972904160896	-0.7442163168635889	-0.43914138222316607	-0.37122844299592156	-0.3696846248330997	-0.356981393736439	-0.33337407756225995	-0.30597019188003843	-0.25903885487627526	-0.2493681215969504	0.10892979333005595	0.18344212860501635	0.22597794332306254	0.38143757001612677	0.4611788613964589	0.5128865368221875	0.7171076965115236	0.8044601059988706	1.1430962849060309	1.5805446208112317	2.3139133173815924	
Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic. Speaking of timeliness, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong. There were sly reference such as 'they paved paradise to put up a parking lot'. The filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers. Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie. Very little of what the characters said were believable. Combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail. Although, there were two exceptions Kelli Williams liven things up as the future flower child and, despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was quite good. Showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".	-3.594730228691928	-2.125819500108483	-2.027444090057342	-1.3922644693516724	-1.3603076453935188	-1.2948478081094188	-1.099558917064344	-0.3518996113366101	-0.33472267004999323	-0.09793153831704068	-0.07746142702327709	-0.058115561569392044	-0.011301210718731646	0.07451251286319345	0.08219180773721214	0.09744873802852087	0.15541799945266443	0.2811493967971895	0.5325730168314015	1.1226521361944264	1.179179351785244	1.2460335694607754	1.711814828719443	2.20147377860019	4.61233427258978	
This the the final feature film that Michelangelo Antonioni directed, with the help of Wim Wenders, and adapts from his short story collection "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds contain 4 short stories with familiar themes that we've come to be accustomed to from his earlier works, and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via Wenders' directed scenes involving John Malkovich's The Director character. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we're used to from an Antonioni movie, while Malkovich's narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place.<br /><br />Nonetheless, all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters, and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight, perhaps due to the lack of time (since they're short stories anyway) to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical Antonioni movie. And the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. Maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship?<br /><br />The first story, Story of a Love Affair That Never Existed, tells the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel, and later meet at a cafe. It's as if Fate is playing games on them when they meet, but part and meet again much later, but like the games people play, it's almost like a L'Avventura or a La Notte with the lack of communication, and of the expectations from the man.<br /><br />John Malkovich's director character takes central role in the next short, who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop, played by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable, but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him, and in what I thought was to scare him off, tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. But in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics.<br /><br />The next short, Don't Look for Me, is the longest of the lot, with Peter Weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the more star studded of the lot, with Jean Reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it, which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists. But unfortunately Reno's involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements. There was a key element adapted from L'Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too, while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting. If there's a negative theme here this short wants to play upon, it'll be the duplicity of man.<br /><br />In between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from La Notte, Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in Red Desert. Finally, we have the final shot This Body of Dirt, with Vincent Perez as a young man going after a girl (Irene Jacob) whom he just met, and falling in love with her, only to realize that it is a love that is too late. It's a relatively talkie piece, just like the first story, with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they're in, which sort of brings to mind Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise.<br /><br />While on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces, they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the "excuse" to link them up was a film director's exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film.	-8.165661663202943	-4.270510235080629	-4.096211875543652	-3.8880940279089384	-3.7178193022853465	-3.5041390538626973	-2.5525904282533634	-1.052493182276214	-0.40429575171312276	0.08716333089490694	0.25878552028234825	0.39059235489285016	0.4855063829521773	0.5773992360550219	0.644584674974818	0.7181569615040371	0.8477268735274095	1.0949102548084464	1.2700887485344052	1.2883698273453454	1.310815522749217	2.2885434886121403	2.7071797755145424	5.455996157527247	10.92707133175582	
If your idea of a thriller is car chases, explosions, and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire, then "House of Games" is definitely not the movie for you. If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it.<br /><br />"House of Games" tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense. Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming. Just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance.<br /><br />The story is taut and well-crafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good (Mantegna is superbly charismatic). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot (at one point, I believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... I'll say no more).<br /><br />"House of Games" is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity. It will hold your attention every second while you are watching, and stay with you for a long time afterwards.	-2.7334362409928064	-2.366920060697355	-1.9341240420669608	-1.789048898221516	-1.1981896266577614	-0.836950669570393	-0.7520956164032719	-0.6238703795225078	-0.3298692514801766	-0.024931349979499005	0.023155722449132166	0.18039161958338473	0.2839757517550746	0.3004030760530425	0.3638469457665705	0.38482153486706916	0.41544041092778794	0.47283164238816433	0.6125556888692907	0.9739022309096088	1.0747720138722947	1.3406240263417784	2.479109402445622	2.7845767959657532	5.000519267334982	
NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that's leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake. After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby's cries coming from the house next door (where there is no baby), Kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor. He's greeted with hostility by the unhinged, disheveled woman (Maria Takagi) who answers the door (and promptly slams it in his face) and gets a peek at her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely, both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noises, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that. This piques Kobayashi's interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what's going on. He soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister, unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic. Well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant, and TV celebrity, Kana (Rio Kanno) seems to think we may all be doomed, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help. Another female psychic/actress (Marika Matsumoto) becomes involved, as does Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable kook/psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to "ectoplasmic worms." Clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that's now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba...<br /><br />Unlike many other hand-held horror flicks, this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first-person scares. Thankfully there's something of a storyline here, a very interesting and intricate one at that, so it doesn't rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera-work every once in awhile to keep your interest. The way Masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth - with well placed jolts along the way - reminded me somewhat of THE OMEN in its pacing. The film also doesn't entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian, but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we're watching is an already completed documentary. That helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the 'actual' footage either. Overall, it's a well-made horror film, with lots of plot shifts, some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments, that's well worth checking out. My only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long. Otherwise, pretty good stuff.	-5.4952701349624595	-3.414656141732649	-3.074196598643481	-2.2333620895722	-2.198714603931213	-1.693107228221036	-0.9957330576360397	-0.7086615952682872	-0.6653242290038042	-0.5243918525665284	-0.26920741549238114	-0.23069817726622227	-0.13637851722487404	-1.3580323947940537E-4	0.1684193030194021	0.42316889787901757	0.6326120170901287	1.0284129210102573	1.1205669761056785	1.2425227989912913	1.5160023918358176	1.839698791029015	1.871872569551875	4.4104688213526115	7.955808420907879	
When thinking about Captivity many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, unentertaining, unsuspensful, unsexy, unfathomable, and unwatchable.<br /><br />I used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of Scream but these new Saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics. They still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing, but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore AND hip.<br /><br />This movie is a load of boring crap! What the hell has happened to Larry Cohen? His name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993! Even so, I was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something THIS bad! Was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did anyone not know it when they first saw him? Only someone who has never before in his or her life, ever seen another movie!	-4.850553417139558	-2.178516508936023	-2.178189892719025	-1.8981881992078078	-1.5720722673126086	-1.4010480329760164	-1.3380644650523426	-0.9246387488939245	-0.7231362571868573	-0.4056940084984477	-0.3382504757020677	-0.14692954563120367	0.09933853415840843	0.12380797723874984	0.22466733088203983	0.23483996923596634	0.29059304844225753	0.3446155585290922	0.43334345176744615	0.5609549189536285	0.7624736131986231	0.7955635004268709	2.0071092514552853	2.126900694044993	4.87259932637634	
Finding this piece sandwiched between a stale prequel and a rehashed 80s machomovie on a UPN affiliate's midday Saturday program would be misleading. It deserves better and definitely uses its talented leads' best attributes to its maximum advantage. Bracco and Walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre, do the streetwise, 'troubled minds' routine that they are so good at portraying.

Inspired by True events, Radio is one of the best acted, heart felt dramas I seen widely released in sometime. It definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003. <br /><br />Radio stars Ed Harris, who is Oscar worthy nonetheless in this film, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. However Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. Some members of the team, then tie up radio and throw him into a building. They then bang on the building and finally Coach Jones suspects something is wrong. He comes over and helps Radio, who is frightened, and from that point on Coach Jones and Radio shares a very special bond. Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events. He also becomes Coach Jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and Radio.<br /><br />The movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death, and family relationships. The movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. The thing I liked most about Radio was how real it felt. The performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad. <br /><br />In conclusion, I feel that Radio was very overlooked by Critics only getting average reviews. They must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. Also the performances as I mentioned before are top-notch and Oscar worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underrated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie. Radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is a 9/10.	-6.394832324319226	-4.84000859036173	-3.855612864480767	-2.942141490525328	-2.4964032534490275	-0.9994312827648988	-0.39255201645995497	-0.26120304511195785	0.4432240032996009	0.5725883511594201	1.0309044036449595	1.2764555700697522	1.3579756215018313	1.3716467172587274	1.468385986451725	1.612792373721155	1.7006533988175163	2.199170847613548	2.4691697783620628	2.6235238556411624	2.8639313778500766	3.058627981400051	5.6423663104366995	6.870796809752262	7.740211132527217	
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing. Guy Rolfe, so fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely features this time and Richard Band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy). Totems, minions of the Egyptian God Sutek want the secret of animation life back and the puppets (when they surface) act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking Totems. The Totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique - they don't share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don't really fit in. Top scene is Pinhead using a rag to clean blood from Tunnelers drill bit, classic and about the goriest this film goes. The fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era (or even galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and series fans certainly do. Grrrrrrr.	-4.288555796416112	-2.2428362800663195	-2.0261785496653024	-1.95574995966681	-1.8611956109958308	-1.0045236630443537	-0.5416612950831017	-0.44562026979672476	-0.4313962927921302	-0.3523673404847212	-0.2838963404675541	-0.2176799673625686	-0.06479464906543295	0.09417189624613806	0.09760521106133141	0.10711283437209007	0.1992669951740268	0.4452434384438843	0.5513251440258526	0.8987044154165637	0.9561028133642139	1.1768214593845538	1.3165756523676633	2.5448978567288476	4.767636661962378	
great historical movie, will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch. View is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject.

My parents may enjoy this show, but I fail to find the humor in it. What is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays. Blame that on shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game" bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. Sure, the series has its touching moments, still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series. This is nothing like the family-oriented days of "I Love Lucy" some five decades before. <br /><br />An answer I would have to why this series plays on the Lifetime cable channel is because that channel's brass think women can relate to Reba's character! I absolutely dislike the character of Reba Hart's daughter, Kyra. She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Funny, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra; Scarlett Pomers, is like that in real life away from acting. Who plays the blockhead ex-husband dentist, Christopher Rich, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is ditsy in herself! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying.<br /><br />Something else that baffles me is why the dingbat-of-a-series creator, Allison M. Gibson, decided to set the series in where I live 25 miles away from; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire isn't even from this state, she's an Oklahoman! Why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting? What I mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it, but the melodies are basically tuneless!	-6.510129221764549	-3.5425383415494323	-2.8094132568003545	-2.1623184480017814	-2.1079084314251415	-1.6322719385412374	-1.3490793141133441	-0.7025681680162582	-0.5947858413883071	-0.5224021125835566	-0.43156885901697006	0.047151512858673	0.05535796724405574	0.06073228061661212	0.22003865908696824	0.6215586457661664	0.7608208789690515	0.9616324269624916	1.342742883431457	1.372637583447308	1.5502313921835629	1.559958496117935	1.6190446893694903	4.154497626999672	7.729138602274189	
Dear dear dear dear dear...me! I had the strength to see it through... But why?!<br /><br />The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good. But this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing. This was some kind of Tremors for kids. I can't believe this movie was made at all..seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they just did whatever they could with it.<br /><br />What audience is this movie for? I can only think of 12-14 year olds. If you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow, but it's so utterly boring. The characters are overacted (not just a little either) and so stereotyped it's fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen. You know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes...you've seen it a BILLION times before in any hero series on TV for kids. I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced. It's so bad..so wrong..so...crap.<br /><br />But OK, we did get a laugh now and then. Not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..It's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. Still makes me grin when I think about it. But that only happened one more time sadly..and that's when the "badass" gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment "They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point we where almost crying with laughter. But after that..nothing could ever top that..(?)..so it's pretty much downhill from there. <br /><br />So tops here are demonic trouts and overacting. If anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he's either a "plant", vegetable or someone very evil. This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far. Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it's bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...*goosebumps* no..I'll leave it at that.	-15.070433590793213	-9.209287592319543	-5.634060012458981	-5.03170137166182	-4.636597474752527	-2.9559370950745536	-2.7823263202107387	-2.0332832110902737	-1.6604800658946675	-0.9512164156533177	-0.4851838329704787	-0.42910400458233977	-0.3205911989271989	-0.07126679915602313	0.09047313329035586	0.3499082278290748	0.4309199777400178	0.4931118386702844	0.5632044706382063	1.076297424424522	2.7139656302701463	2.972460670581065	3.3005881452192756	7.214594601118708	13.368768393433061	
EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING,Jr. Should Have Won An Oscar For His Portrayal In This Film!!! He WAS the film! While the film may be lacking in some areas, Cuba was awesome... and for me, this is the best role that he has ever played! The scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry IN THE THEATER!! I guess I could really relate to this film because I saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up... what a tragedy! Getting to see the "real" Radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too! If you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears, you need a heart check! If you liked "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you'll love "Radio" too! I wish they made more movies like this...Radio is the Real Deal!	-2.302379034061462	-1.8062408121718656	-1.3872638175768772	-1.166605022954585	-0.49243909101936545	-0.3939814222293857	-0.3164294899236363	-0.27459712783214785	-0.2616427257884134	-0.22533163130058131	-0.06152498096415447	-0.05836416233844125	0.005872244758983958	0.06751771803461834	0.12225630622795654	0.4878094603713964	0.6478976758047803	0.686736315119338	0.75256753085661	1.0867656436400321	1.5505151365531136	1.8810503365945077	2.048040296740368	2.255381889943619	2.460243190908269	
Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons, I had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (The first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on TV.) Once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. That's pretty much it as far as plot development goes. It worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make-up FX, fast pace and unpredictability. The sequel, however, doesn't cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don't really care about one way or another. If they were annoying or idiots, then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered/demonized/eaten alive...but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered. Plus, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and out of it), they are constantly cutting back and forth between them, which kept pulling me out of the story. There are some amusing bits, courtesy of the splatter FX and campiness. Such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floor's construction after another as if it were alien acid... The first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party, and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child. However, that sequence parlays into a ridiculous-looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim. I got a couple of chuckles out of that scene, but I don't think that was Bava's intention. The scene probably would've worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman, but hey... Other little things like the over-zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don't help matters. In summation, I managed to see the unrated version on DVD, and can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available R rated version, because the make-up FX and gore were the only thing I got out of it. Also notable is an early role of producer Argento's future hottie daughter, Asia. In fact, she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she's barely on screen. Argento/Bava fan's might want to check it out just to see it, but will probably find themselves looking at their watch, like I did. Gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx, but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy-looking evil baby puppet since Little Selwyn from Dead/Alive. You could do worse, but it certainly doesn't live up to the original.	-7.459004409574243	-4.638182416634109	-3.901831683700776	-3.3564416385524445	-3.2308903804833697	-2.3035891366027803	-1.732432787506592	-1.3227835227865299	-0.946466644834838	-0.6818779641978877	-0.5145902051985596	-0.5085052095598582	-0.02045845346837339	0.18162266594687793	0.4501622934946725	0.640121612110649	0.7851509001829183	1.2518469420251415	1.6004027887051775	1.8281446377373691	2.0293129129537117	2.0779332753819117	2.2491870948451225	5.673079131969092	9.63337913333082	
I cant believe blockbuster carries this movie. It was SO BAD. I was totally fooled by the box art. DON'T BE FOOLED!! Its not worth your time I promise you. I don't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what. I am so disappointed. :( <br /><br />The description on the back of the box doesn't even match! The girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper. The synopsis on the back says she is only 17. Did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it!? Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be. If anyone actually liked this flick then I've lost all faith in humanity.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the story compared to the title. Or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations. Or that the cops didn't even have close to real uniforms. Why would i even say that?? Who cares about the cops uniforms!? Compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on. <br /><br />This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans.	-7.0626846806225165	-2.8844581580341906	-2.1741205588985557	-2.0697350008229467	-2.0613090436935884	-1.9837183005819614	-1.8896271696893332	-1.4895369415885202	-0.961069030116773	-0.6955719968163969	-0.35459557611894665	0.07735140420516493	0.34065772115823983	0.6824382157733742	0.6962256985135322	0.7166155011249187	0.7245608441023165	0.7988653147004903	0.8281010325666128	0.9582045147484586	1.1295035128151782	1.2491114233301184	2.268751444119217	2.9772622665256963	7.389486274617069	
The premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is charming... but this film is near unwatchable. The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap. Most of the singing is off-key. I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it... The dialogue is really stupid and trite. The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots. I found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering 'when is it ever going to end.'	-2.7647832271020145	-1.2879625962877383	-1.2493104146825211	-1.1718263466474932	-1.1239795874866416	-1.0171248036660718	-0.9128143457582019	-0.5428859613810473	-0.3594275033524203	-0.30726526133614035	-0.2452489310389061	-0.1988149369110131	-0.19774361179637773	-0.0772791369983196	0.12896182638497378	0.1698114920049346	0.19546903019021317	0.20401996722963145	0.23981584043066587	0.4272091723256939	0.4346271826996383	1.1038270671593793	1.2809485823316948	1.5194550802528433	3.1274260110488523	
My mom and I, rented this movie. I mean, we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks, whether they be big Hollywood flicks or Indy flicks.<br /><br />But oh, we were fooled!! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small city in Texas. Halfway through, all the sudden things get all christain on us. My mom and I believe in god and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie was preaching it, made it annoying. All I really have to say, is that we are Christian, but even we like to have fun. So don't blame christians as a whole, just blame the christians who need to suck the fun out of this movie.<br /><br />In fact you can clearly understand the directors stance on UFO's, and that is that he believes it is all demonic. Now, i could say some words, but I will not. All I will say is, that DO NOT WATCH this movie, unless you feel like being preached. In fact many times it states that we must be perfect in order to enter heaven. Well, last time I checked, the only perfect person died on a cross.	-4.839390433865344	-2.7143627452413486	-2.0225205791417786	-1.7690360571969754	-1.5853518752406388	-1.3624101772867983	-1.2373648291825425	-0.5276915166982753	-0.5248420842255735	-0.3634917475912891	-0.2799700749694892	-0.11431289194487547	0.08927338031153817	0.10372342864225775	0.25551394572232383	0.58356431986929	0.6784605818000934	0.686667359447359	0.9002234655827634	0.9495458661697787	1.0386248791025465	1.142476000031314	1.3163654058842729	3.0403327424444924	5.718561422207488	
Following the appalling Attack Force, chances were that Seagal could only have a step up with Flight Of Fury. To out-stink Attack Force would take some doing. Flight Of Fury is a marked improvement overall, but still in the grand scheme of thinks, mediocre. Mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for Seagal these days, a sad insight into his movie career's decline. Where Attack Force was a hodge-podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception, to filming, to post production, Flight Of Fury keeps the plot line more simple. Someone steals a high-tech stealth fighter, planning to use it to fire chemical weapons (which we later, bizarrely discover, will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs). Seagal has to get the plane back. It's that simple, no annoying sub-plots, and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works. That's not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though, it's pretty poor. The introduction to side characters is badly done for example.<br /><br />In filmic terms FOF is bad. It's badly acted by all involved, and Seagal looks bored to tears almost. He's just got the look of a toddler who's been forced to perform the school nativity against his will, and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness. Can we blame Seagal though when the material is so un-ambitious and cruddy? Not really. This is the final film of his Castel Studio's, multi-picture deal. The producers can't be bothered to make anything remotely good, promising a 12 or so million dollar budget, and (after Seagal's obligatory 5 million) probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves (If the film was made for the remaining 7 million, then I'm Elvis Pressley!). So in that respect why should Seagal put the effort into a film that's already got distribution sorted before it's made. Fan's though may argue, he at least owes them the effort. He's seriously looking jaded, and the continued use of stand ins and dub-overs is further indication of this. Michael Keusch directs with some efficiency, while the cinematography is quite good, but in all technical areas (and as usual with Castel, a bog standard stunt team) there's nothing more than mediocrity, and nothing to help the film rise above its material, and bored leading man. Again there's a few action scenes focusing on characters other than Seagal, which in all truth we don't want to see.<br /><br />Overall the action isn't too bad. It's nice and violent, and on occasion we're treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings, but overall nothing special. Partly due to a poor stunt crew, and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting. For me, Shadow Man was a more enjoyable film, because while ignoring the incoherent, jumbled, plot line, there were more vintage Seagal moments, and more of him in centre stage. He never disappeared for long periods during the film. Seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here, and re-appears after, with little explanation. There's far too much stock footage used. Using stock shots isn't an entirely horrendous thing, but using it as a crutch is. We're treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships, all the time, which get annoying. Plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place (just check the backdrops, chopping and changing).<br /><br />The film is just middle of the road. It says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless, and gratuitous girl on girl scene, with two hot chicks. Seagal even perks up briefly then too! Overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there, but that's not saying much at all. This will please many fans, but they should bear in mind, Seagal himself would probably want to forget this one's existence. **	-19.53080838797103	-8.480158177487262	-8.233972847330648	-6.848843187068059	-6.605871551304994	-5.501524066695319	-2.71628547830231	-2.3762732181827753	-2.2166674325191886	-1.8170027318427806	-1.7949876171814334	-1.0315557176589312	-0.9097148813453906	0.4728356372170215	0.6583555087810703	0.6695494121225485	1.9569396649971318	2.3177130427676698	2.3798889157559104	2.5869866289337247	2.8512902714565223	2.91837552195498	7.355030544311767	9.412995524140454	19.940824595265926	
End of the World is an uneventful movie, which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth. The main character is some kind of scientist, I'm not exactly sure what kind. He has two jobs at a government(?) facility guarded by four security men. His first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space (although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job #2). Job #2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room...at least that's the best I can figure. Apparently the "plant" is not exactly top-secret, as the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs out (they're on their way to a dinner) while he discovers a message from space: Major Earth Disruption, repeated over and over. He says something about it being the first message from space he's ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him they're going to be late for the dinner party. So they leave and go to the party (!?!). Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there, the movie goes... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but that really doesn't help much. Besides, Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade sci-fi. Plus, there's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed.	-8.679654427038498	-3.483099272344746	-3.3058863536234675	-2.8587985916813636	-2.664646163413291	-2.329789193785499	-1.917197958851947	-0.9006388077961913	-0.6245514995104242	-0.5164258690097456	-0.29500287224862953	-0.27474021875646637	0.16058228493604465	0.2536771312868958	0.29484004464024355	0.40161886062173013	0.5455595268933016	0.6672426537041458	0.8085913617996674	0.8486007348883623	0.8504569360703169	1.2261629557591414	3.8444084051500207	4.105396846188786	9.091397028306565	
By 1941 Columbia was a full-fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as MGM, Paramount or Warners. That's the best thing that could be said about "Adam Had Four Sons," a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by Ingrid Bergman (top-billed for the first time in an American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchwoman (this was the era in which Hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another) hired as governess to Baxter's four sons and staying on (with one interruption caused by the stock-market crash of 1907) until the boys are grown men serving in World War I. Just about everyone in the movie is so goody-good it's a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous. No wonder Bergman turned down the similarly plotted "The Valley of Decision" four years later.	-1.9877923532838921	-0.9569397668860881	-0.9292282197204407	-0.8959571479528302	-0.8808739115511889	-0.5184280855296357	-0.31487153635045906	-0.31181079827149905	-0.25441854055032054	-0.23978424137070603	-0.23217236015292547	-0.20924472261713822	-0.06277157527787036	-0.027861375805534494	0.014365004596138608	0.05538026447145337	0.2030506527236775	0.21830510745727189	0.3413826520192737	0.35667210989079173	0.3954060858891758	0.4013774642044341	0.6301327857795435	1.2167504714602297	2.190172166698298	
What was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent Hollywood films? Well, whatever it was, the magic may also be found in this Columbia picture. It's a long forgotten screwball comedy that Turner Classic Movies has begun to show. (Maltin's movie book does not contain it.) In nearly every department, Amazing Mr. Williams is a jewel.<br /><br />It's the story of a first-rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended. As the wedding bells are about to ring, he gets called to the scene of a murder. The lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force. There are a lot of laughs in the process.<br /><br />Melvyn Douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious.<br /><br />The film goes on a bit too long, but who cares? The screwball comedies are always able to entertain, and this film belongs right in there with the best.	-3.9268824628043757	-2.2966496708027684	-1.7749558625337551	-1.7186238116493473	-1.2067021673053895	-1.1615065423658373	-0.5926278472081361	-0.5694038921417681	0.016420197592414674	0.10020565234326184	0.19710462550311902	0.3047161776065225	0.42385865621426283	0.49824938730539625	0.5573868307866039	0.6021321997525605	0.6477820407085997	0.8345801653336977	0.9427451297365592	1.0361428389476415	1.1171022600847806	1.4763881680900584	2.795974883899229	3.855259144345309	4.925762088406101

I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results.<br /><br />Clive Barker is said to have revitalised horror with Hellraiser but this is a film that effectively stalled his cinema career somewhat. What an unfortunate thing to happen because, like the inhabitants of Midian, this film seems to be misunderstood.<br /><br />Barker has created a cross-breed of genre staples in this story - it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans inhumanity to man. Evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes nigh on impossible (cue the child!). The practically Klan-like human insurgence (pitchforks and holy wrath!) at the films conclusion becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what has gone before. As a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite evocative.<br /><br />I pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as Barker's fantastical indulgence gone too far. We have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and Mr Barker make nice and devote some time to it - the better.	-1.8779505728335062	-1.8217234472937809	-1.701724729406097	-1.5354665029496726	-1.3792708864384309	-0.7542840069596128	-0.6852461558819412	-0.6655270577615428	-0.5529793717451905	-0.1623750013139761	-0.10510632133982967	0.025668749752156675	0.19436672468099953	0.3335443622494825	0.34104949250119215	0.34630762344064736	0.35165479052386356	0.40265398177675293	0.726332711353719	0.747496045817174	0.7912099285911957	0.8000608672087839	1.9477429470693064	2.6548102432170677	3.8397641773958258	
This is a snuff movie. I'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia, and all other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. I thought I was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. It was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie. I am shocked it was edited to this ending, and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It is harmful to innocent minds on many levels....watch the movie, the ending, and you will understand this statement. Plus, included in the plot is a sweet little girl "not yet 9" her character says. She is not in the snuff ending, but she is an integral part of the movie. Why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition? The director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film.	-3.1768100584335857	-2.6304764273224714	-2.0142052598908102	-1.4752832398130757	-0.9590389190091071	-0.6040641311171786	-0.30298173914099275	-0.25866923704602574	0.05426199131417115	0.07273022062605183	0.08084464340065307	0.10391939375730674	0.17801748423277852	0.2402333037290473	0.3449600060608578	0.38162697019870334	0.42965540465348934	0.6925695545350453	0.7095700794995194	0.8459982659060818	0.8580987010346283	1.7097060051198927	2.7625186400927317	2.8851185509770163	4.811010317804092	
To summarize, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes, plot inconsistencies, untied loose ends, and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from Jurassic Park 1. The editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling. In short, this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpoint<br /><br />Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I really enjoyed the pterodactyls.) We got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action.<br /><br />As a scientist and former childhood paleontologist, the lack of any real scientific content (not that it had to be realistic, but logically formed i.e. how they built the dinos in #1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) was disappointing as well.<br /><br />In short, the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money. I hope that movie-goers don't fall for this trap again (although I did apparently)	-4.785170721739371	-2.2224043255300496	-2.175186484615748	-2.168374898705622	-1.998752033925188	-1.3378737158521405	-1.223011716901253	-0.7440738186325071	-0.41523323849788396	-0.35664429949220355	-0.22238790586297158	-0.1759371495526906	-0.15477370042152216	0.1144824074213537	0.13544860565419972	0.1387934389356718	0.31979458828413776	0.37197820623392625	0.5244745076693622	0.5823327142336688	0.5989440182886394	0.6656612101746243	1.7425766604835307	2.5124385197607237	4.929283466454029	
This is a sort of hidden gem. It has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! One of the great directors of cinema, Fritz Lang, has created a real gem in this excellent western. A fine cast led by Randolph Scott (in probably one of his greatest performances), the always sturdy Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in an exciting Zane Grey story of the laying of the Western Union cable across country. It has tense drama, sprinklings of humor and great effects. It's reminiscent of DeMille in ways and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own stamp on it. At very least this is a damned good western!	-4.084722626976099	-2.0427980055895314	-1.5953329377804453	-1.4046750903108922	-0.8767119311286505	-0.4787006962291265	-0.340313604876489	0.12193048098333446	0.13344556800991594	0.2955554117926756	0.3025795798143073	0.30442849403127126	0.4477672717267888	0.7378185781724669	0.838527346395853	0.9321533309053531	1.027468070271005	1.2254852389451847	1.2400101023820325	1.503562598825439	2.0603586743175275	2.1411128271799096	2.428783130728416	2.5116386580232692	3.4672462656060783	
Ahhh...the '80's. 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in America. Fresh off the "Do What Feels Good" '70's, "The Last American Virgin" comes as a wolf in sheep's clothing as yet another 'teenage sex comedy' from the glory days. Oh sure, there's sex, but, I can't think of another movie--OK, this and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"--that really wasn't killing time between topless teenage scenes--there was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavage.<br /><br />The movie follows three hormonal friends. Gary (wanting to lose his virginity), Rick (stud incarnate), and David (overweight, but, not inexperienced) as they try desperately hard to make sure Gary joins the world of manhood. But, a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger--Gary falls for Karen (pretty brunette who loves the bad boys), and can't seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that David and Rick can facilitate. Only trouble is, Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen skips a period. It's Gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion, and it's Gary who truly cares. But, who is Karen dancing with by film end...Rick. Subtract the "R" and add a "D" where necessary.<br /><br />What separates this film from others from the '80's we think about is that, by god, they attempt some real drama here, and not of the "my parents just pulled in the driveway variety." And, you know what? I bought it.<br /><br />It wasn't sloppy. It wasn't far-fetched. And, when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at the house party at the end of the film, I actually felt sorry for the guy. Our teenage Romeo actually believed in unrequited love--and when his heart was broken at the end, it all sort of touched me.<br /><br />So, all the T&A aside, there's an actually pretty believable and engaging story here. Oscar worthy? Not by a mile, but, I don't know that I'd lump it into the "let's get laid" category, either. Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High," they actually were trying to do a true film here, letting the hi-jinx in between fall where it may.	-7.369337958349284	-4.483419249261981	-3.4530169748510415	-2.97859062061303	-2.407403057011362	-2.3643299930357373	-2.1051702038744566	-0.7297306471670427	-0.6522715756105725	-0.44033749379254067	-0.04878202225220902	0.008064587008118067	0.04793598127445427	0.17924858777831765	0.7933727474322361	0.7977419985298784	0.978755665245135	1.0727222048352316	1.46994206813653	1.5782601063003447	1.819366688632266	2.039295628733664	2.06845878963523	4.656017881186351	8.76269086622347	
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart, and I just knew that I had to see this movie, even though I can't say I'm a soccer fan. But watching this just filled my heart with joy, and I had a great time in the movies watching it.<br /><br />Bjørn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it. The whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word N O R W A Y on their trip to the World Cup in soccer playing in Germany this year. <br /><br />If you're only gonna see one Norwegian movie this year, this is the one..	-1.6583310444380222	-1.5387420949386863	-0.9548955226090398	-0.9125275247947697	-0.8420766660360537	-0.5501004346962535	-0.15962219563534552	-0.01248279148378853	-0.007235403349649908	0.11523375771751099	0.20281955185610928	0.266704569258551	0.27982241216967796	0.3787032417752157	0.3923461618814329	0.47409378000106966	0.5533223609146977	0.6153971109247136	0.6302132753047559	0.6720083812112884	0.7173330219239111	0.7711312261950275	1.6615933385819324	1.7221598209491877	1.7306368711920146	
How did Mike Hammer live - in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube TV and a snazzy fireplace? Nah, he'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered Camels on the couch or floor of his fly-specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown LA flop house, wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face, that's how. Spillane wrote trash paperbacks, for sure, but how do you make it worse? Give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any Film Noir titled crap will sell at the box office, add some over-the-hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw-up the story-line by some retard, drugged out screen writer, that's how!	-2.2629655234774537	-0.9530540379590666	-0.939127988446302	-0.9158290255070421	-0.7527650780328995	-0.7120464444634427	-0.47003581986998616	-0.3808840017680389	-0.3290683191798698	-0.2736171901935933	-0.19887193857799698	-0.18825074943603512	-0.10095992740769856	-0.0822055695039579	-0.011793913865943972	0.013480300112449259	0.1328130580508139	0.22424174527323842	0.25345054704067	0.30391014439471276	0.32323394636665825	0.3823275254001107	0.6588933579151393	1.088902192182114	2.1902320689981547	
It has its merit's; Morvern Callar is both the merits and the disappointments. She's so enigmatic, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that's making her so distant and un-relatable? Or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary? Personally I'd call her dysfunctional.<br /><br />Morvern is completely detaching herself. Disposing of her boyfriend, not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, she selfishly splashes out on a trip to Spain. She's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed. The only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her. Although by the end her friend is dumped and Morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity. She may as well have killed herself.<br /><br />Despite managing to make Spain look as gloomy and bland as the UK the director's shots were superb, the lighting and color made the film visually stunning.<br /><br />It's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest. It's little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer. They manage to make Morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don't care about the characters or the film.	-3.0461366691854304	-2.989793490099637	-1.7365293107669668	-1.3907510993590628	-0.8930191067720092	-0.8054168164094188	-0.547480781523522	-0.25616380209947526	-0.22261773287502556	-0.1980473665980268	-0.019695495216872735	0.08042225112218553	0.09558606536782963	0.20299475928869193	0.20442464001184601	0.3572137402612207	0.4463235055677597	0.4641976031615403	0.5349021697574166	0.7216874843279577	0.9755881954407052	1.0635641110745966	1.791719857701839	1.8019808179924723	4.407111524443214	
Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas. Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare.	-2.811595822647151	-1.2317594459939971	-0.9602878727993613	-0.9434004089048729	-0.9314282895706745	-0.6798252347227632	-0.6528955257536507	-0.44592513793472693	-0.4301659258664856	-0.4068835976741683	-0.37790110120257403	0.05608099967609548	0.0685593981793998	0.15303821907693296	0.300226715755342	0.3063620178112362	0.31450129095867485	0.31834282775088907	0.3509784704290796	0.3871301434804606	0.5931943769814788	0.7477692587986136	0.8176918706032356	1.2737721715763617	2.960303053790012

Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!<br /><br />The ladies in the movie...perhaps they better stick to XXX.<br /><br />As for the LEADING MAN...what a lead!

A SUPERMAN Cartoon<br /><br />A huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train. Using ultra-modern techniques, a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold. With intrepid reporter Lois Lane as the only passenger on board, it's Superman to the rescue. But now that it's become a runaway train, can even he stop the BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED?<br /><br />This was another in the series of excellent cartoons Max Fleischer produced for Paramount Studio. They feature great animation and taut, fast-moving plots.

I have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life! As stated in other commentaries, a who's who of talent, such as, Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland, and many more were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as an Agatha Christie story. I keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast, done the right way. <br /><br />The film has even less intimacy than the Christopher Reeves 'Superman' movies. The large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films, because there is not enough time to get to know anyone. Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack had me wondering if the wrong video was in the the case from the rental store. The music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed. It's hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes, was more offensive. From someone who has seen most Christie films (that's what attracted me to this, it was one of the few I hadn't seen) miss this one. It is not an Agatha Christie movie. Golan-Globus are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling, rather than the snug atmosphere of English mystery.	-5.745478030056096	-2.9837797096211354	-2.5337294809414987	-2.270426455147438	-2.019331468054834	-2.016149887439437	-1.6610781966416368	-0.45633588712301654	-0.2718799899141848	-0.2296787185548491	-0.10736293872656162	-0.07776596298791605	0.08510492433009949	0.15161167372013462	0.1948334578895572	0.2042887475271228	0.31717866590609556	0.49031392104560995	0.9823498935352772	1.1628777061598037	1.1772527037949088	1.2005171023258168	2.0438106364637822	3.309012884857701	6.463531758206751	
Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.<br /><br />Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it.

This was usually producer Alexander Korda's advice on set to many of his underlings; the film is credited with three directors but in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped out, pushing it to six.<br /><br />For John Kobal's 1987 book, "The Top 100 Movies", his survey of 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reach 55th place. A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half-way mark.<br /><br />The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movie's production shifted around England and America, eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love.<br /><br />The special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually hold up if you squint. But it's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions. Among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it's rear end, begins to fly. There's also a killer toy of the six-armed Goddess Kali, (perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her) and a quite horrific-looking giant spider. Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn (genie) nearly a thousand feet tall! Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. And look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle!<br /><br />John Justin does well as the Arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff upper lip. Sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15year-old, is near-namesake Abu, a likeably cocky thief. After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog. When it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind Ahmed's (Justin's) perspective, we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues. In truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.<br /><br />Three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; I wouldn't classify this as a musical. It's all great fun; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boo-hiss villain, and Abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber. It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies, but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in. Quite commendable.	-4.461592779955297	-4.3718125767226175	-3.4290287943580706	-2.6616652727136034	-2.3061155668239004	-1.9800187261809055	-1.0255643954415765	-0.40905341655724553	-0.4006204960077052	-0.3862781941418401	-0.23733302261036707	-0.12261596091823546	0.10615879256054707	0.2726833271279626	0.5097576105739214	0.6406206681828015	1.0167487079948299	1.3079391703080454	1.593401495447727	1.7349137094335896	2.730367314652028	2.9162396210622332	4.179045640713169	5.144510220209558	8.306046815433886	
"American Nightmare" is officially tied, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />Seven friends (oddly resembling the K-Mart version of the cast of "Friends") gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It's hosted by a guy with a beard. That's the most exciting aspect of his show.<br /><br />Chandler, Monica, Joey, and... oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded DJ. Unbeknownst to them, a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening...<br /><br />Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and... wait, sorry again... by making their fears come to life. These fears include such stunners as "voodoo" and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures.<br /><br />No. Really.<br /><br />This movie was, in a word, rotten. Crazy Nurse's killing spree lacks motivation, there's nothing to make the viewer "jump," the ending blows, and--again--voodoo?<br /><br />If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them.<br /><br />If you care for your loved ones--even a little bit--go to your local Blockbuster, rent all of the copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.	-6.542713548825956	-3.63545621110816	-3.413934032567699	-3.2746661264099948	-3.111206046810644	-1.1165874130468367	-1.047167180062646	-0.8593061941362519	-0.7674041897960356	-0.6874187008840855	-0.6489059234388257	-0.3962563338481175	-0.3177268312847528	-0.24381619380711728	-0.1961692958042262	0.3994419390725906	0.5283486597314841	0.8960913287338432	0.9939975805671573	1.2937105446091632	1.3433987629557993	1.3712419314056186	1.4452819664541463	3.6998963332906576	6.463052001933973	
I would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie I have ever seen. It's not just the actors that are bad, but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about 5 minutes at a time. Anyone that likes this must be crazy!

One of the funniest, most romantic, and most musical movies ever; definitely worth renting/buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography.<br /><br /> The animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie.

Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten and<br /><br />raped in the opening scenes of this made for TV movie. The film<br /><br />then flashbacks to the few days before the rape, as Beller is<br /><br />harassed by a stranger.<br /><br />Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson and<br /><br />Dennis Quaid are double dating early on. Beller's anxious parents,<br /><br />laid back Tony Bill and shrill Blythe Danner, wait at home wringing<br /><br />hands and so on. Right away, the 1970's makes its dated<br /><br />entrance, as the young couples discuss the romance and love in<br /><br />"Three Days of the Condor."<br /><br />Beller, an amateur photographer, begins getting threatening notes<br /><br />stuffed in her locker at school. The film makers wisely give us a<br /><br />whole slew of suspects: Beller's new boyfriend, Mattson's<br /><br />boyfriend, Beller's dad, Beller's ex-boyfriend, and what about that<br /><br />overly friendly photography class teacher who wants Beller to be a<br /><br />little more sexy in her self-portraits? I knew who the rapist was<br /><br />because the Worldvision Video company video box has a picture of<br /><br />the attack on the back cover, destroying any suspense in that<br /><br />regard.<br /><br />Without giving away who the attacker is, Beller begins getting<br /><br />harassing phone calls, and is eventually raped. The movie then<br /><br />heads south as she makes like Nancy Drew and secretly sets up<br /><br />a time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student.<br /><br />Finally, the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration from<br /><br />Beller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in that<br /><br />day and age.<br /><br />The suspense here is very real, without going over the top into<br /><br />scary movie stuff. Beller is very good, and watch for her and<br /><br />Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater- both do great jobs. The<br /><br />film is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role,<br /><br />and everyone is professional.<br /><br />This was made in 1978, and it shows. I am sure no one had any<br /><br />idea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by an overcritical horror<br /><br />movie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in the<br /><br />morning, but some of the attitudes here are embarassing. The<br /><br />teacher who tells Beller to be sexy is never made to explain what<br /><br />exactly he had in mind. Nowadays, if any high school teacher said<br /><br />that, then THAT would have been a made for TV movie on its own.<br /><br />After Beller is raped, the rapist is still a part of her life, as warrants<br /><br />are issued, blah, blah, blah. There may not be a case because<br /><br />Beller is not a virgin, and cannot prove she was raped by whom<br /><br />she said. Many of these problems have been addressed with<br /><br />modern technology and policing efforts, but this film obviously<br /><br />knew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate. Rape is<br /><br />an act of violence that has not gone away, but efforts today to catch<br /><br />the attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago. The<br /><br />problem is the anti-rape angle feels tacked on, like an<br /><br />afterthought. Before that, we have a tight little suspenser that has<br /><br />real honest to God characterization. After the rape, everything<br /><br />changes, filmwise, and not for the better.<br /><br />I remember Beller from the '70's and '80's (and who could forget<br /><br />her revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she has not done anything in<br /><br />almost ten years. This is a shame, since she was very good way<br /><br />back then.<br /><br />I will recommend "Are You in the House Alone?!" based on the<br /><br />acting alone, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two-thirds of<br /><br />the film. If you want to relive 1970's made for TV high school life,<br /><br />this is your cup of Tab.<br /><br />This is unrated but contains physical violence, some sexual<br /><br />violence, and some adult situations.	-13.768229319410935	-7.403008618388293	-6.896679665049268	-6.322544074306294	-6.154100822237634	-3.0705421683454754	-2.112197269346438	-1.5229566831033943	-1.2921942529038806	-0.8145686269724468	-0.6446448444118839	-0.5816695313082452	-0.29279051812883516	0.7000753428808799	0.7111799310958256	1.4947189278640516	1.6415575197230778	1.66937847857707	2.239803126763308	2.503435633149621	2.623059159264177	3.3353778654850315	3.5507060307433624	8.508519959327835	16.66066921213229	
THE HAND OF DEATH most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due, in no small part, to John Woo's masterful direction, coupled with Kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. It's a role reversal the likes of which I don't think I've ever seen before (Tien normally played a hero and, in fact, with his moustache, I didn't even recognize him at first). Sammo's goofy "buck teeth" only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. His choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith, and I believe I actually glimpsed Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent.	-1.8435531099851792	-1.5883645456493827	-1.5564760260665085	-1.4287153865233868	-0.9659387156742627	-0.8643693528751759	-0.8480422337156638	-0.6285729461245124	-0.5782109790379447	-0.009680244568487748	-0.009628113848311533	0.06787406138409494	0.11538069688880992	0.13863606387602234	0.22495657804550406	0.2799195449017608	0.30729563756391276	0.8382158556077812	0.9794239351201699	1.0352875999289983	1.2165961828027934	1.3582018678138348	1.5636466613474447	2.550728904519848	3.557643045220929	
I give it a 2 - I reserve a 1 rating for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen films. We don't even remember what this movie was about. The only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground, roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting. It was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform the 'stunts'. Also, when the characters were driving in a truck, the engine noise (or radio? can't recall) would vanish entirely when the actors were talking.<br /><br />And, like others, we bought it because of the Sandra Bullock front cover. very sad, very bad.	-3.4276396580123274	-1.4060624039916494	-1.1866054199785454	-1.0680895635935093	-0.9447410891868129	-0.7777616679309896	-0.6014865124666776	-0.5944226238576765	-0.421164563528653	-0.2787306751610646	-0.1537674625003911	0.13628116491697337	0.19310510457493846	0.19409349123767608	0.26835207075856005	0.27823206160798725	0.36596990318124134	0.3719264194875871	0.3788090591962769	0.40620096770004543	0.46776267250192866	0.7712055616442532	1.1694162842813323	1.589538024731295	3.6806411314663	
Rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title, and realizing that I had rented it some time before.<br /><br />Quick plot line. A couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in Los Angeles from Joe Estevez, still cursing the fact his brother Martin Sheen could actually ACT! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the 1930's and his last victim. Their ghosts inhabit the couple, first enhancing their sex life, but eventually becoming more menacing.<br /><br />What ensues is cheap R-rated sex scenes, cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time.	-2.951974670143005	-1.7678811173900377	-1.6771273845431365	-1.675910425106531	-1.6455525535872102	-0.5743924227537957	-0.46540637559240283	-0.4626998770653071	-0.43904918038973206	-0.4218557130963032	-0.325190815589315	-0.2483895839861115	-0.22936969206311794	-0.16588175467537145	-0.02839095775472532	-0.004165845209036123	0.029377948849251267	0.18117108158462508	0.4841509000172871	0.5253625529258543	0.7595415798730514	0.9598146454327464	0.9738581721047097	1.764579131260853	3.0754979366295663	
Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like "Arrested Development" and yet they keep this show and "War at Home". I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy "Married with Children", but now it's just getting ridiculous. "The Loop" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a constant flow of jokes. Fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe. I mean, if you're going to invest money into making something entertaining, make it entertaining. Also, stop using "no-named" actors. It's great to have up-and-comers, but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity. Duh, Fox.	-3.683849735853792	-2.1375169110063306	-2.1339472091194596	-1.7142549724178648	-1.5630372648248685	-1.0115633721163746	-0.8710861828745288	-0.5937279098766044	-0.525638930857929	-0.4601338905144519	-0.3516666619143461	-0.24083715681846468	-0.13459557110518394	-0.12059273002506862	-0.044519996725110436	0.12042408971998078	0.12072876266858777	0.39502535745395495	0.6135017757276715	0.7797580105558378	0.9208617440535167	1.20949406546351	1.5785411668845772	2.4848545022222464	4.6241445332983515	
Dr. Sayer(Philippe Leroy), a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, Maria(Dagmar Lassander), a free-thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones "fixed" instead of females. Sayer retreats to his palatial estate, running Maria through a humiliating series of mind games, threatening to molest and kill her. Sayer's desire, it seems, is to dominate her body, mind and soul, making her his sexual slave, obeying his commands, adhering to his every wish and whim. After resistance, at first, Maria slowly teeters towards his objective, but has plans of her own..she says she wishes to help Sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women, so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm. It seems that Sayer has her under his grip, agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenarios(..such as lotioning his toes, "making love" to a blow-up doll which is a recreation of himself, often spending time topless, and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose)which almost break her, but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with Maria..and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness, Maria gains an upper hand, toying with Sayer's lust for her body.<br /><br />More of a battle of wills, a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand. Through a great deal of the film, Sayer mistreats Maria, forcing her(..it seems)to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature. Her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortress..it's a typical European art deco kind of palace, fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spell(..it features walls and doors opening at his command, with an area quarantined off for his "victims"). But, once Maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands, the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him. He finds that he actually craves her and Maria uses this to her advantage, playing hard to get when Sayer wishes to embrace and ravage her(..and, I could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazy)<br /><br />I felt the film works, ultimately, as a war cry for women, their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. The "twist" finalizes this ideal. I couldn't swallow Sayer's fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen..we see how he develops his toned athletic figure, and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin. If he is so well fit, and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen, how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with Maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances? <br /><br />Maria, he would later admit, is the first he's actually kidnapped; others from the past, call-girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman, even if it's all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do so, to take a leap from the norm, costs him more than he could ever know.<br /><br />All this psycho-sexual sub-text is rather fascinating to see unravel, but Dagmar Lassander, such a yummy sex kitten, was my reason for enjoying it so..without her, I couldn't have liked it as much because she's vital as a victim worth striving to obtain. Perhaps the film's highlight, the delicious dance as Lassander, clothed in gauze(!), unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy score..it's the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat. Dagmar Lassander must've been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well..she has this kind of cool, a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers, Dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her career..even if the film isn't well known(..I found about through word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and risqué subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex(..and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative. At times, I couldn't help but chuckle at Sayer's comments towards an imprisoned Maria, regarding how he enjoys making women suffer, and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery(..in an attempt to make the words poetic, it all feels rather hokey). But, Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, to me, works at it's best as a fetish film, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist, captured and held against her will, forced into a precarious situation, her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. Her submission, and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with her(..there are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him, unveiling a possible attraction towards him which, in itself, might startle some who watch it)are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature. My other favorite scene, besides the dance, is the piano concerto with Sayer fondling Maria as she plays a soothing melody.	-18.28693581282791	-10.375241744090882	-6.476252319759551	-6.299088104637463	-5.493401885817945	-3.13296136158414	-2.8554143598485395	-1.8037562441885249	-1.5128552117287366	-1.4726753669042805	-1.295565229141956	-0.19549579101444148	-0.17797278522074475	-0.04897942853168541	0.3696112721434302	0.5207334319445762	0.5654759142169073	0.9806052524980466	1.097939554979493	1.8568673196756882	2.3163617685039117	4.12386204528791	4.421364234003809	8.573828418342679	15.160018834246461	
There are no reasons to watch this movie. Should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill (like that would ever happen) then get this movie from the video shop (if you can find it AND put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie. Be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone (in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing). Oliver Reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk - go figure. But wait I forgot there is one reason to watch this movie - Claudia Udy showing her chest! Sadly no other reason than that!	-2.785374894343554	-1.5330708978258323	-0.9796997700237027	-0.9645565883142968	-0.8991896768391672	-0.7591009665292654	-0.42296687332067584	-0.27377449766951356	-0.26246454635460814	-0.14937567338207436	-0.05238823743778001	-0.040688368070474976	-0.017728803809195903	4.1469758139585366E-4	0.19696957899015044	0.35997335657717466	0.46381607575399714	0.5455678619312442	0.5641085182424427	0.5739544072358094	0.5817127628393235	0.6345931289804945	0.6731080024222122	1.6607988289589466	3.2569118272736324	
HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie. There are plenty of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this junk. Obviously, the "green" on their minds was money, because there's no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some clever movies with Pixar.	-4.167599956066148	-2.007762791104565	-1.829557584925205	-1.7734018015531055	-1.448918771608984	-1.4481613714294104	-1.441547469864313	-0.47691761758120743	-0.4263257420301711	-0.21933946612801639	-0.1542245491998547	-0.059590139263445516	-0.05725147536232883	0.25858259090622787	0.34071664188868	0.3539479606333612	0.36301792395861054	0.6673307634390797	0.6678535878690672	0.7191726533720513	0.733326096225177	0.8263106713420658	1.6574605612358235	2.503787283749095	4.752745862669386

How sad it is when a film as wonderful as "Jurassic Park" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make.<br /><br />Go see "Shrek" again.<br /><br />	-1.6662082310844695	-1.2948177792669766	-1.2284298639070599	-1.0942079849239756	-0.8217706911712503	-0.45252806934703116	-0.4269562711404907	-0.3732781237323617	-0.32916652921770284	-0.18428125314813623	-0.10187431480224865	-0.09242102901706477	-0.08857266042770913	0.09372118200815571	0.09502633307875206	0.15331303325734957	0.18967532046146315	0.44531205861994233	0.45653193386626395	0.4636705340909993	0.5550427134848468	0.6196509412058723	0.6543540346440181	1.160878996488723	1.9764202236719104	
Dominion Tank Police is without a shell of a doubt, one of the most amazing shows ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) mostly consists of action and fun, the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part. The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second Part (Acts-3 and 4). I do have some complaints though. In the first part, the Tank Bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all. One might also question the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was cool. Buaku rules.	-1.7746542539953944	-1.5183931129001662	-1.2163444277039301	-0.9975758043281598	-0.6333953873867346	-0.3168462530819768	-0.21997521211893303	-0.18214025670397566	-0.11991242815689368	-0.05755005151501466	-0.05417329550835194	-0.05185452661260968	0.009784744862414199	0.1049111525756515	0.13901032072136774	0.1449170018224524	0.1650774680879387	0.19148587293937394	0.3164400760249998	0.4235311001092178	0.43744197439493154	0.8405779443365247	1.108264507668919	1.4978151747836175	2.6741564270895055	
This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three locations (the school, the store, and the coach's house) that are really used. It's primarily at the coach's house, however. A movie doesn't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.<br /><br />Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up. One is rich, important, and has no real love outside of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition is turning him sour. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is a traveling alcoholic.<br /><br />First off, I love the actors in this film. They've all been household names to me. They proved their worth here.<br /><br />One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up on the coach. He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game. His blows the coach's whistle and yells back his catchphrases - "Forgive me Father, for I have sinned!" It's amazing to watch, with energy that just chills you.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn't need shiny effects to interest them.	-3.2989033786791	-2.9214157243420584	-2.067653338541228	-2.024483319435026	-1.7704730953732297	-0.6842691858898277	-0.42564965168774943	-0.3578792602890871	-0.3389124066169012	-0.3047852110291721	-0.2933920205393498	2.528112354436493E-4	0.03362547861448978	0.2417928965114108	0.5301015601991772	0.5641474835454958	0.9213740114260809	0.9487892877857887	1.0017984606172017	1.0761707616182339	1.7245828930020426	1.7740764671735034	3.4431201384751997	3.7810834655065273	5.253889088996024

Karen and her boyfriend Jerry move into their new Los Angeles apartment.They discover an old brass bed that Karen takes a liking to,unfortunately it has a really sinister history involving kinky sex murders."Deathbed" tries to be a creepy supernatural tale,but fails miserably.The action is slow,the acting is nothing special and there is no suspense whatsoever.Even the sex scenes are lame.The climax is pretty gory and violent,so fans of splatter should be pleased.However the first hour of "Deathbed" is deadly dull and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares.Definitely one to avoid.My rating: 4 out of 10 and that's being generous.Watch "Re-Animator" or "Castle Freak" instead.	-0.9741789586737155	-0.7475649469822625	-0.5788277535735722	-0.5536180906040034	-0.4921888392690623	-0.31067653763818925	-0.2965961729365578	-0.2846677435888441	-0.15518273451006287	-0.1437051252349473	-0.09348790234342261	-0.05595054431789983	0.01563103232438598	0.023235442477967994	0.06739156495027296	0.06787825589184543	0.09262960718202964	0.14268276235946642	0.1755209038485978	0.17891253365657545	0.19017588699682225	0.2127413789010316	0.2525663717945232	0.8196145429773019	1.0656272604174974	
Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /><br />Plot: A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for TV movie. Gail Osborne is new in town. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. That is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. throughout most of the movie, she tries to find proof that the person did rape her.<br /><br />Audio/Video: This 1987 VHS edition from Goodtimes stinks. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen.<br /><br />Extras: No extras from Goodtimes home video.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This suspense filled made for TV movie was made in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo on the front, then buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty crappy. This can be a little boring, but if you are patient, the ending is pretty good.	-3.6101808106922544	-2.717510996151845	-1.8171667688939341	-1.3435908984046372	-1.2966357566094906	-0.9366635926732779	-0.7123594905763635	-0.6121952238318852	-0.5615022670611881	-0.4944868907038077	-0.28964486617070195	-0.18712910527476118	-0.09827688091817935	-0.0396260493257223	0.06445722681391669	0.1017800750770754	0.4459633724950211	0.7751801609476736	1.0355927792672837	1.2335952122046314	1.2825518408908365	1.2839731707876634	1.9409764803825855	2.998407475341663	4.869916486725556	
When I see a movie, I usually seek entertainment. But of course if I know what genre the move is, then I will seek what it is meant to do. For example, if it is a deep film, I expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying. But Who's That Girl? is not a deep film. But it is entertaining, nonetheless. It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch. There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts. I've watched it when I was younger. The cast is always entertaining as usual. I had a small crush on Griffin Dunne even though he wasn't the typical male heartthrob at the time. Haviland Morris also stars. And late Austrian actress Bibi Besch is here too! Overall, a delight!	-4.903504163143437	-2.6932824865570013	-1.8956506572316483	-1.0779542129769946	-0.8413741281601916	-0.4128679062627676	-0.25811142840750767	-0.07060824169912094	-0.0405603589232927	0.022555095468895586	0.06457192958134965	0.09755533583419718	0.2517041915088452	0.5765619102777245	0.6870414463507727	0.7286697267281224	0.7300399474983761	0.7659409308827171	0.8796989285744946	1.1333736427695285	1.145467307838787	1.2833337547367452	2.691940726696356	3.716407519767508	4.151106720681297	
Masters of Horror: Right to Die starts late one night as married couple Abby (Julia Anderson) & Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) are driving home, however while talking Cliff is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road. Cliff's airbag works OK & he walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for Abby hers didn't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body. Abby's life is saved, just. She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns. Cliff decides that she should die, his selfish lawyer Ira (Corbin Bersen) thinks they should let Abby die, sue the car manufacturer & get rich while Abby's mum Pam (Linda Sorenson) wants to blame Cliff, get rich & save Abby. However Abby has other plans of her own...<br /><br />This American Canadian co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt (whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn (2003) which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode) & was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I didn't think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I've seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still doesn't come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution (2006). The script by John Esposito has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although I'd say it's a bit uneven, the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over Abby's life & the affair Cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart. The character's are a bit clichéd, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum & the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice pace & overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes here & there where it loses it's focus a bit & I wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending.<br /><br />Director Schmidt does a good job & there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out-and-out blood & gore. There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there's shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross (images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser (1987) & it's sequels), then there's the main course at the end where Cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box! Very messy. There are also various assorted body parts. There's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked...<br /><br />Technically Right to Die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant & as most Masters of Horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made-for-TV show which basically if the truth be told it is. The acting was fine but there's no big 'names' in this one.<br /><br />Right to Die is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted Masters of Horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene! Well worth a watch... for those with the stomach.	-6.0447694309846005	-3.4941311863262596	-3.31465800045616	-3.264985657460447	-2.4974333099114103	-2.437335830024309	-2.2492776906206577	-0.6275761391378154	-0.5047561003584433	-0.37607852604071623	-0.18638939464310653	-0.07651403969076151	-0.06915483415000034	0.05312357240664506	0.0930256259587768	0.20352066665086688	0.4192381534023709	0.756218481024445	0.8361379293955028	1.1950041450942988	1.5970586154625444	1.804122844174448	2.150716006086525	4.121159693118396	7.851334335967662	
Meticulously constructed and perfectly played, To The Ends Of The Earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age.<br /><br />Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute films chronicle the journey towards both Australia and experience of youthful aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an aging man o' war in the early 19th century as he heads for a Government position Down Under.<br /><br />Among the crew and hopeful emigrants sharing his passage are a tempestuous, bullying captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a canny 1st lieutenant who's worked his way up from the bottom (Jamie Sives) and, fleetingly, the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally passes in the night.<br /><br />Quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have a canny eye and ear for the manners and stiff etiquette of an earlier time, crafting a totally convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era.<br /><br />Shipboard life is one brutal, monotonous round of seasickness, squalor and danger after another and as Edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of life's hardships, Man's inhumanities and his noblest sentiments.<br /><br />Those who enjoyed Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World or Patrick O'Brian's series of novels on which it was based will love this  for everyone else, it's a whole new world to discover.	-1.2477320539638344	-1.161679207020208	-0.960811909221418	-0.9077412763705937	-0.3797067260526319	-0.3633635290821894	-0.3047507793044528	-0.28910113252423647	-0.2569493195115275	-0.11622998532449991	0.01942384221189246	0.1728367640606424	0.2012480087505864	0.20930909173612047	0.2985947363044004	0.3032958118615022	0.37600503680973213	0.4381044478842374	0.5426936032042535	0.6264739636409201	0.7433381664637678	1.0573414136756656	1.2005601104567034	1.2552337773213846	1.9757740634429604	
"A Tale of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological horror that left me speechless.The film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy.The small cast of actors is truly excellent,with lead Im Soo-jung being especially memorable in the lead role.The direction by Kim Ji-woon is well-handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.The plot is slightly confusing,but some scenes are wonderfully eerie.The action is rather slow,but I was not bored in the slightest;I was extremely curious and intrigued.The house,where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated."A Tale of Two Sisters" is along with "Ringu" and "Kairo" one of the most original Asian horror films I have ever seen.Watch this masterpiece as soon as possible.My rating:10 out of 10.	-1.5971764076974049	-1.0319029134304403	-0.5798770566671237	-0.1639996961777723	-0.14837641007709265	-0.14790495919975646	-0.029884799553163525	0.07620655897782061	0.10986784556264895	0.13446810389309105	0.16625064813412055	0.24009990606625875	0.3354080359395657	0.3355602349854719	0.3492616382851767	0.3573527777034622	0.4212925744135188	0.5633357092399526	0.5916965776911889	0.6576366934206694	0.6654794777011792	0.738137234409444	0.7551358823292185	1.5407034157828026	1.5579216464386219	
This film is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. Her bitchy demeanor from "Law and Order" carries over in a failed attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing to come out of this mess is Charlie and Denise's marriage. Hopefully that effort produces better results.	-2.5221911847551697	-1.6061677053621612	-1.2953603488284822	-1.1801909131845	-1.0861820977934729	-0.5625726391621318	-0.5392382169911267	-0.41137657983941645	-0.1319392970038237	-0.026199093671963217	5.236608572242452E-4	0.02706319506169407	0.06905885177641838	0.14553912144054185	0.17646773013502792	0.18340531257498394	0.2608780082042585	0.3670729361273733	0.38082211323665655	0.4800811660211608	0.5114953392679948	0.5321077151579592	0.8006357409007296	1.4455350762272534	2.9751947294826557	
A worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out.<br /><br />With such an outstanding case, one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins. But scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity, no character arcs, and inexplicable behavior.<br /><br />The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand, completely unexplored. It seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers. When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture?<br /><br />A regrettably dreadful movie. When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one? I expected better of her and Kristin Scott Thomas. This one is definitely one to miss.	-4.245607708285108	-1.9932263071838332	-1.8258842765445409	-1.6839348036504223	-1.6671375137402098	-1.655503554197547	-1.6194386151902114	-0.7188519044514288	-0.31663360934526846	-0.2859574608117401	-0.10783883253868246	-0.0876952463156949	-0.07289910318594643	-0.0018658661226592654	0.1402055842996418	0.2484520214176103	0.2859224576897808	0.4843673584667774	0.5087526287905724	0.5519015248691598	0.6288763221893416	0.9097838270132185	2.0455336712290246	2.2341480665251594	4.9044423065758345	
While not as wild and way out as some of Takashi Miike's later films this is a very good crime drama. <br /><br />The basic story is the story of a cop of Japanese cop with Chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming Chinese mobster. Complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust. Its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film.(It is a very very good one) This is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't mind a no frantic pace.<br /><br />A word of warning, the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty. There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex. If thats not your cup of tea, proceed with caution.<br /><br />7 or 8 out of 10.	-1.756650478281261	-1.7217131933707177	-1.2623360052394303	-1.081367946909836	-1.0385047233542384	-0.6619631538601971	-0.5683949812097343	-0.43723659023594363	-0.23932050731721732	-0.2360429346916903	-0.1961495869062527	-0.06402495461763268	0.022402724630639685	0.23559598648279118	0.23965346076914593	0.26765871104749434	0.4378370163947418	0.5309773610833182	0.5390948018054073	0.7025015718687896	0.7551238584068176	1.0737832695996086	1.682351746426279	1.7178248582327411	2.728551706625062	
Faith and Mortality... viewed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years..<br /><br />Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career hustler, never settling on a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory-- he must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as it has been failing along with his wife's health (and his own).. but Belafonte's Levine has his own problems, still pining for the girlfriend he left behind..<br /><br />Belafonte's character leaves the film before he seemingly should, and so the the ending is cryptic, and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending..<br /><br />This is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith.. it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors..	-4.805068662070003	-3.1426632552606684	-2.0983005372773733	-1.6595667043097957	-1.5924177483595523	-1.5305959453874185	-1.52790969867625	-1.3500029058579943	-1.055945734188275	-0.9714642963170291	-0.9596308498117027	-0.5404110698048095	-0.18504754518421937	-0.046000814020249955	0.04052207506388377	0.07398028781840045	0.17669119712006187	0.2824425749584467	0.7531529582416323	0.8306042571031281	1.2880533272826942	1.3484832107853142	2.0677064724897107	2.177673638752796	2.9963771559932737	
The animation in this re-imagining of Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes, the film is sleep inducing. They should have called it "Peter & the Snails", because everything moves at a snail's pace. I couldn't even watch the film in one sitting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture.<br /><br />Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank me.<br /><br />I can only guess that the Oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short (short!) category, the voters will have to sit through the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - and must predict that there's no way this film will come close to winning.	-3.844873809260204	-1.6808630216048197	-1.5855651483722473	-1.2516476223439135	-1.2476236787786268	-1.242968034788487	-0.6845334098162432	-0.6271732494417075	-0.5651278158539548	-0.3542849721264857	-0.2908032121393565	-0.11441553997035786	-0.004607418163738539	0.09049560871000922	0.104461335776344	0.28973322359323683	0.3751679175903958	0.5542949428433136	0.5736601406733762	0.5845277259000655	0.6210529503910641	0.7223072694921301	1.3711697420131348	1.9212620781651188	4.191573245857321	
Also titled--> The Magical Castle--> This one is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake. Only some girlfriend of rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (not voices remain). Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread. Next thing you know some bird will have memorized the "forbidden arts" and Swan Princess 4: the magical bird will be born. Thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close.	-3.2169616877408123	-1.800607537654186	-1.5187215410326294	-0.9759006997539699	-0.8529201024297295	-0.8229605769493178	-0.5478925892800858	-0.5098641927632597	-0.4096120679949079	-0.3156109819602304	-0.2239242286980345	-0.218774524819177	-0.08377263301103681	0.06703238206212278	0.34190942876171304	0.3667338888791247	0.375939611363898	0.5522920388715469	0.6009345998198065	0.6696065419102658	0.7203660694547431	0.7259367405226793	0.7279742682706368	1.6479944529538058	3.451081150154398	
Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) stands trial for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses give evidence - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Wilhelm's brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelm's former lover Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The film ends after the court sums up....<br /><br />The film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand. The story is mostly set in a small Polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills), who Wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of the Jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) denounces his Nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris), Marja's daughter, after she has been shot at a brothel.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.	-1.449505416158933	-1.129772714187148	-1.0550787509417971	-0.9439242397679757	-0.6606593402414882	-0.6589757811943682	-0.6379941030974513	-0.0883165573992408	-0.014056322330679438	0.02224942354657696	0.04594702026392544	0.07117006532356113	0.1736286058554653	0.26385918479934645	0.2688551357658628	0.3333784096817468	0.3602984340496468	0.47915477235397647	0.6046499861615999	0.7070813239330334	0.7948910102940995	1.0598875928917972	1.5607703976122407	1.6291611917515896	2.616294586650876	
Mind you, it's not supposed to be, but it is. As a wee tot, I watched this movie in the theatre (Being a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that I didn't really like it very much. I blacked the rest out, and for good reason.<br /><br />A poor film on par with the greats like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman," "No Holds Barred" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling. Well maybe the stakes aren't all that high...and quite frankly I feel dirty just calling these people "professionals" at anything. And really, except for the first scene, there's no wrestling to speak of. So I guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating-the-c***-out-of-people. Sounds good, right?<br /><br />Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the champion of the WWF (Never let it be said that Hulk Hogan was typecast, this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents). Essentially he's playing himself, but with a wardrobe that's more black and blue than the Hulkster's red and yellow. He also has this hand gesture he does. It's kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts, except you stick your thumb in the air, and you curl your index finger in. My friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an "R." Try and see for yourself. If that looks like an "R," well, then, Mars needs women. But anyway.<br /><br />Kurt Fuller, with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz, plays a TV exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting Rip, who's evidentally bigger than Elvis, on his network. He won't have any of it (And exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera), and so the movie follows Fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at Rip. He does so when he creates his brilliantly titled "Battle of the Tough Guys." Marketing genius, this guy.<br /><br />From the numerous hand gestures, to the rather idiotic fight scenes (All played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious) to the overacting, to the far too frequent shots of Hulk in nothing but undies, this movie has everything you'd ever want in a dumb movie. It's frivolous, not too taxing on the mind, violent, and includes the phrase "What's that smell?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?"<br /><br />A classic for all time.	-8.011229143617344	-4.927776171064475	-4.094840133823496	-3.118820804022713	-2.900713879320747	-2.562873250958823	-2.2316056971367106	-0.6472587923379074	-0.6110265570676313	-0.4709541955202871	-0.33460189986863004	-0.1987769576465657	-0.10049210108282511	-0.013912627191963553	0.21036618068688342	0.38399693873044566	0.5115595048427749	1.389402753833817	1.4979646295562206	1.592889969280628	2.0474467050082885	2.163077162239273	2.9827641744808537	5.070191190327318	9.812056912635517	
If you consider yourself a horror movie fan, chances are you've seen Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They're superb, and Ring's making its way smoothly into Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will be adapted soon too?). While Ring is almost 100% pure heart pounding and nerve breaking, a tale of two sister is both nerve breaking and mind twisting.<br /><br />Along with The Other I consider this Korean flick a brilliant and smart ending horror movie. The only flaw this movie has is some consider its first 20 minutes rather slow. It's actually typical with Korean and Japanese movies. I consider it carefully planned rather than slow, think of it as "calm moment before the storm". With thorough introduction of characters, imho viewer will get involved more intimately with the character, one of Korean and Japanese movies strongest point.<br /><br />Like Ring, a tale of two sister doesn't overdo ghastly appearance. Rather they let our mind do the intimidating job itself. That way it's scarrier and horrifyingly classy at the same time. I won't be surprised if Hollywood remakes this movie after bringing Ring and Grudge/Ju-On over(This flick is not that good by the way, I rate it 5.5). Don't miss it!	-3.2263596483679335	-2.748833492357237	-2.253451961554496	-1.8529251300241576	-1.0619238113728091	-0.647474334647191	-0.6044979903648455	-0.5625400312610214	-0.5170408254545719	-0.49057252614238633	-0.44167649570724704	-0.4255961693823297	0.389986746784511	0.42985710884862255	0.463162497185303	0.5161539385986206	0.5618246063070017	0.6275997092611866	0.6324385899411236	0.7739298637334499	0.7949985983105051	0.9742506085094098	2.5431972796190205	2.7877834269227386	5.209416302805175	
I had seen this movie as a kid and loved it. I loved how spunky and full of energy Nikki is, and how she mostly ruins Louden's perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways. As a kid in the 80's I saw New York exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie, the domain of Madonna's character, with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc. Now as an adult I find I love the movie for the same reasons, and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of Ms. Nikki Finn. Although I would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie. Pure beauty and genius.	-2.8616118250718108	-2.536491162956538	-1.2936635250710564	-0.6933748057213034	-0.6280854424595913	-0.2854833348603484	-0.13338883411846258	-0.017273063821781173	0.06386102393849953	0.17847150704237386	0.2500324505563776	0.5106964552234561	0.5498936319106781	0.5855750790106795	0.6599902304862936	0.7099940052392226	0.7174326070623066	0.7737485193472144	0.8225987623554392	1.0338989208340876	1.0434041678126458	1.378054630557111	1.7254206187837402	2.121914661668272	2.9281261540929284	
Over the years I've seen a bunch of these straight to video Segal movies, and every one holds the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, the entertainment level is at a low. Sure, the action sequences were amusing, but that was pretty much it. Seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision(at least on the action standpoint), but during the past ten years, these types of movies that star Segal really do not meet his past qualifications.<br /><br />On the more positive side, the movie did make good use of time, like some of the action sequences and use of wit. Just when the movie seemed to just drag on, a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more of Segal's movies would do better if he wasn't the only one that fans recognize in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses, maybe the movie will get more popular results.	-1.4468885102712856	-1.3441755468795509	-1.0483392294960248	-0.7554433392703933	-0.7288667785960191	-0.6700389556752193	-0.3542076400567892	-0.29842563140014033	-0.2865056079672226	-0.23358555323042224	-0.23153142339408547	-0.12842179697737025	-0.07168154162984088	-0.004001083968067087	0.106473140543774	0.12239524995238657	0.1643985862697187	0.2635143688260231	0.6275183322993855	0.7128317431500166	1.2366560559676718	1.251627789953639	1.3462909307594444	1.5481258518716552	2.2699322054809596

The author sets out on a "journey of discovery" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the (completely and deservedly forgotten) movie "Bright Leaf" is about an ancestor of his. Its not, and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self-indulgent glorified home movie, suitable for screening at (the director's) drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his/her immediate circles.

Notice I have given this 1 star if the option been given I would have given this zero. As I put this DVD into my TV and sat down on my couch I was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest. I looked this movie up on IMDb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so I guess I came into it critical of every mistake. But it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen.<br /><br />The box makes this movie out to look well OK at best. DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU. This movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it. The acting (if you can call it that), the "plot" (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese), and the special effects really are just terrible.<br /><br />Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch.<br /><br />In the end I'm not saying I can make a better movie than this, but I am thinking it.	-5.134296993517443	-3.1860194587038118	-2.8767709778807595	-2.6833290317991008	-2.506159786819416	-1.780263130954766	-1.4236282636500825	-0.8120794959364493	-0.5437992988308585	-0.14278269365571075	-0.1384524677560619	0.08126528433919994	0.08905142071003773	0.12367889878451717	0.16905599898215368	0.4565106660583999	0.6847885688224491	0.7441089785108171	0.749818891192367	0.800658483028953	0.8329816898310359	1.1415975277887838	1.2044665445600442	3.2854839528738675	6.245466500016849	
The plot seemed to be interesting, but this film is a great dissapointment. Bad actors, a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur. If there was C-movies, this would be a perfect example.

At first the movie seemed to be doing great, they had the characters profiles set...the plot seemed to be going in the right direction... however, as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things...or just a lot was edited from the movie. The characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie. Also, there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning -- in other words -- they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself. AND the title... no where in the movie does the title fit the movie...I suppose the title works for the previews.... Actors did well with what they had.....if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would have worked out better. But it didn't. So now there's a new terrible movie coming out this Friday.... My opinion!....don't waste your time or money.	-4.1265913714551665	-1.8749694374064654	-1.6484993001108412	-1.605216050707657	-1.6034829910764343	-1.54002425914563	-1.5099616136028713	-0.20067075490502623	-0.1734232226880449	-0.07135540025342438	-0.04452608245574895	0.009320762295190674	0.06531686620327148	0.07561272300914178	0.09853300099039136	0.12624853963710875	0.2733650355235101	0.312903360818799	0.33196217972354664	0.40271394004309724	0.43344057048370627	0.8296990136169975	2.215896284425107	2.3494981330960663	4.508511457786428	
looks like the bet movie I've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive. Antonioni is comparably wise to his movie. Malkovich's so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. I've change my world outlook after this cinema. I'm a beginner literati in Russia -- country of Tolstoy and Dostoevskiy -- and I'm quite sure watching Antonioni is good and fun for russkies, because I and we do understand his point of view. so I don't understand his lesser raiting on IMDb. I'm sure, speaking from Russia and our people, we like Antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality	-1.8967465532872858	-1.8564081671468342	-1.0774093563390807	-0.5385853138434669	-0.2916975682448519	-0.01042829321724284	0.013829826667725774	0.03621975016394047	0.11486052551295753	0.11736945945172378	0.20359301762660853	0.20909696043101977	0.21562884803019203	0.3430806112074522	0.3640106280422202	0.40415212682975016	0.4043854419131598	0.49087007887386225	0.8529939397653028	0.8603590581239199	1.1305766044614947	1.141941921623935	1.2847824274098218	2.055986473601368	2.745283597744054	
"Don't bother to watch this film" would be better advice, if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a huge disappointment considering the great cast, not just Marilyn.<br /><br />The story was just nothing, certainly nothing like described on the VHS box, of course. There simply was no suspense, precious little excitement and too many dull spots, most of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so messed up. This was not a good role for Monroe, even though I didn't need to see this character to know she could act. "Some Like It Hot" alone was good enough evidence for me. But this role just didn't fit her and it's no surprise it wasn't one of her more popular films.<br /><br />It's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /><br />Summary: it's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.	-5.331998586723221	-3.448387834933038	-3.166388952846301	-2.522838389063651	-2.487447772874118	-1.9603086853531249	-1.5451807459203815	-0.6398308999602031	-0.6064316631210378	-0.3114545028593149	-0.02372926762315017	0.016847691343805413	0.07888612145153868	0.1272955726420899	0.2711463634990542	0.2863112249507156	0.33359076004139876	0.45976471136324537	0.48015420605877224	0.8930118243457709	1.1487143845561287	1.152132119609087	2.121985795810265	3.550199528275089	5.729108983763991	
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.<br /><br />From the very beginning of this film, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets 'Rita Repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field! All of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films. I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was being penned, the writers had visions of someday seeing an Egyptian Power Rangers villain, totem monsters, annoying twenty-somethings who seriously can't act (and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent), and a lame "Decapitron" puppet who's head can morph into the ghost of Toulon.<br /><br />Another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the puppets are back at Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and Toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again (he betrays them in part II for his love of Elsa). This isn't explained AT ALL...and so with that, and all of this other junk thrown in, I was no longer amused.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur if you will. I even collect laser discs of rare B movies you can't find on DVD, and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies I have ever seen in my life. I still love those puppets, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn't broken, well, the series might still be alive and in good health. That being said, even though the reviews aren't so great, I'm really interested in checking out Puppet Master Retro, sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes.	-5.945024698725453	-4.0043027746530395	-3.411486198624995	-3.3841429092153867	-2.7864860245515324	-2.3675371904578792	-1.5671247666642492	-1.1772193591006657	-0.9140806706447476	-0.524772132433206	-0.1237599678022478	-0.09074375246969807	0.32204899551861693	0.324362693880063	0.4474036266908447	0.6974904466471487	0.8928643958169878	0.9146242193162935	0.920315355015368	0.991804451461605	1.1496107506072435	1.865797893227428	1.9497004829983318	4.886624397301756	8.296507519418883	
A antique shop-owner in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley(Valerie Alston)gets put on a US District Court jury, on a trial of a known Mafioso Armand Asante(Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of Pirone attempting to get Whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. Much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with Willam Hurt as the go-between. Much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable. 3/10 is probably going easy on this waste of time.	-3.1659258695025283	-2.022579389048615	-1.9596953199797134	-1.8334073068203172	-1.547493417581703	-0.688661648717338	-0.6395006620021431	-0.5717840296701153	-0.5073063278545072	-0.4300388923266059	-0.3929125563104598	-0.3390856556504583	-0.13462162127391436	0.0025619259263072597	0.06415994594206395	0.07656912308815085	0.11204006970637646	0.44487605470575703	0.510202959496719	0.5284535071928361	0.7691018657433863	0.8141493852153097	1.2054251413261348	1.858847009598802	3.275184587698119	
First of all I hate those moronic rappers, who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like cliché'e version of gangsters.<br /><br />The movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.<br /><br />Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters. I did'nt like him right from the start.<br /><br />The movie is filled with pointless violence and Walter Hills specialty: people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere. There is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no-one. Everybody dies, except from Paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve.<br /><br />The only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they're actors by profession, not annoying ugly brain dead rappers.<br /><br />Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. At lest they have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.	-6.038113721022053	-3.194523295018557	-3.03200011308688	-3.0121781868354653	-2.982446956333938	-1.5911813300967315	-0.9232603336597971	-0.8615044204764433	-0.82395919711648	-0.70837155716988	-0.6564407545918354	-0.6090446756332406	-0.38407859371682224	-0.12281956155753623	-0.10394399220812388	0.22123609207617712	0.43911673514504196	0.4655315969260031	0.954679323279095	1.1420078497382846	1.226961442100808	1.359258758463009	1.9478985703991647	3.3736520300576323	6.364117575286944	
This movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror, but not for obvious reasons. The horror of "A Tale Of Two Sisters" lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of CGI guts and gore; it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout. Best of all, the ending does not provide a clear answer, pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place.<br /><br />Do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins, and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately. This is not the conventional hack-and-slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular. "A Tale Of Two Sisters" slowly builds an atmosphere of terror, a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end. Even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so heavy-handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place. The movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene. Some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this.<br /><br />The true fear of "A Tale Of Two Sisters" lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares; it is a psychological, gut-wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film. It is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so-called 'Asian Horror' genre. Indeed, it would be a mistake to align "A Tale Of Two Sisters" with films like "Ringu" and "The Grudge". This movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints, some requiring no suspension of credulity, others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Whichever way you choose to interpret this film, it is one that demands an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on Asian cinema or horror in general.	-3.952081455877914	-2.9585957654461863	-2.720106408666239	-2.5384118530809485	-1.7310268935625244	-1.363096750004504	-0.6689385181746794	-0.385352863546058	0.010791837255088907	0.04599582547546087	0.10368595733290879	0.1961948373994004	0.33394234591602784	0.40005169191110124	0.417874139317677	0.5733518777227671	0.6322501900595263	0.8542338849046651	1.0393091776068022	1.2340480839293062	1.4638950235319725	1.954228213718209	3.26148186202284	4.055944612056141	7.332724740675229	
This is another enjoyable and entertaining Hitchcock film. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself near the climax.<br /><br />The scenery and locations are great, except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake, which doesn't make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots. I've heard that Hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes.<br /><br />The reviews for this movie seem to be mixed. I think this is a better than average Hitchcock movie. Very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end.<br /><br />I rated this movie 8 out of 10.<br /><br />	-2.6077795520278872	-1.9579690828908702	-1.2179592989444108	-1.0310382695891174	-0.9954891296706446	-0.3516574066933904	-0.07537868867284407	-0.010254603440918681	0.2214357118145644	0.3614862387481176	0.4119152928893649	0.4467565184902752	0.46999234693476133	0.6110200820169696	0.6225422396407604	0.6307912199506165	0.8991671519361876	1.0125317773093048	1.041682748114765	1.0883676027581668	1.160291381769867	1.578383271524521	2.2616519990261006	2.7837961470253645	3.2122049435325084	
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. You can, however, see how far she has come.<br /><br />The one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s.<br /><br />The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting. For example, sometimes when they are in the car, the noises from the car are too loud, and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all. The director is fond of close-ups on faces, and then it's clear that the movie has been over-dubbed because the words don't match the lip movements. Through most of the movie, the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin can.<br /><br />Background music, when there is music, is distracting instead of adding to the movie.<br /><br />The direction is laughable. Goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially during times when there is supposed to be tension, like in the middle of gun battles. The writing is terrible. There are some subplots that make no sense, and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations. The writer/director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in Vietnam, but none of it makes sense. These top assassins and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving. The actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning. It's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing.<br /><br />The production values are so bad that at first, we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have Sandra Bullock in it. If you like laughing at really poorly done student films, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.	-10.950601876191321	-5.357725289803569	-5.167461252232517	-5.055084519377246	-4.460247255104361	-3.233973940711243	-3.181156049441799	-1.0590061012345264	-0.7360215269040314	-0.6814108199833551	-0.6598738335408673	-0.40594155759185596	-0.23340541100068085	0.4981954867096091	0.8007575245402903	1.0974510894099148	1.1045576015662153	1.209629327361786	1.5285670337113093	1.6125350294675802	1.7578460588736067	2.3167404934257916	3.4120296148322993	6.332662643689283	12.34877944050202	
When thinking of the revelation that the main character in "Bubble" comes to at films end, I am reminded of last years "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters.<br /><br />An understated, yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life. The title is cause for contemplation. Perhaps, we, the audience are the ones in the "Bubble" as we are given no payoffs in the films slim 90 minute running time. Audience reactions were often smug and judgmental, clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves. These characters are the ones people refer to as those that put George W. back in office for a second term.<br /><br />It's sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role. This film has it's merits, and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn't say outright.	-1.992553240652926	-1.393511076922576	-1.2202465083892091	-0.8610081539836285	-0.6079600479076697	-0.5752929291314033	-0.5514499418966373	-0.3897518555507815	-0.30024901192692444	-0.007190962353104735	0.05826426508743307	0.08520936847903554	0.1172901452671822	0.1909259193843195	0.19197594666533024	0.21550894098528114	0.22497106316415377	0.47839848656412387	0.5443465963148555	0.6067446941688034	0.6561841319948785	0.8969450820684024	1.1875892552971132	1.7434513985307114	2.6955611539589275	
Typically elaborately crafted HBO production with a first-rate cast, a rich small-town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes, graced by above average production values.<br /><br />But, and that's a huge 'but', the various subplots, peopled with some likable, mostly annoying caricatures, are paper-thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours.<br /><br />The often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama, without being entertaining enough, and personal drama, without being profound at all.<br /><br />A shame, because some scenes really shine.

Friz Freleng's 'Rumours' is an excellent Private Snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime. Produced, as were all the Snafu shorts, to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films, 'Rumours' is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan. When Snafu starts a rumour about a bombing, it escalates into an eventual rumour that America has lost the war. This is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long, rubbery piece of baloney and several strange, fictional creatures who come back to haunt Snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's military. 'Rumours' is inventive, fast paced and funny, all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured, "don't badmouth the military" message. It stands up as one of the best of the Private Snafu shorts.	-1.1830725065696057	-0.9411459522030583	-0.903730908417034	-0.8821018594322292	-0.5159610149774928	-0.3349713639368661	-0.29594328269020737	-0.2921405065996536	-0.1622695188850236	-0.1330416818919942	-0.07719884428322477	-0.01961580665146051	-0.006188921449729105	0.1467975192005598	0.16554745167050822	0.18272223839024515	0.2869696415923132	0.3511855497937923	0.42847909366671233	0.4799131725542104	0.7282551534845956	0.7439492065022055	1.497944808296828	1.562122079780842	1.8618117763792972	
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said? well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks. how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know. im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was. however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real. and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me.	-1.1695209314015553	-0.8598355409572499	-0.4878197429206952	-0.47595661540338874	-0.36044845300790607	-0.3573804527525984	-0.3369025062810129	-0.3278765589882606	-0.25083616904799966	-0.20797416263514318	-0.16791054500582409	-0.06868575798770973	-0.058653914951512065	0.03536157799034724	0.12293771317234707	0.1455551064452715	0.21454949330495726	0.2377434732444923	0.24546432932561724	0.3080450824371138	0.4088787949728321	0.4437489639942268	0.49314573927192545	0.7693813878027996	1.5565528503432182	
Every year I watch hundreds of films, including many low budget amateurish straight-to-DVD abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time, many excellent, many forgettable. Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films I have ever seen  in fact I still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it.<br /><br />The day after, it seems like some kind of weird dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work out of a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' film, and neither would I recommend it as 'so bad its good'. However, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever  this is for you. Now, whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is, I will say Zombie Nation.<br /><br />Seriously  I think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude. He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one.	-5.504612708382771	-2.667995226620222	-2.1564426271395174	-1.921337898778161	-1.7341434350459868	-1.581244390236018	-0.9529978603947256	-0.9497864886436476	-0.6814046827779516	-0.46484240580427927	-0.10202932315575682	-0.07608307566925214	-0.07400813650975685	0.02401010434518508	0.2963283809163988	0.49024455901650993	0.49759142905191794	0.5918589333939452	0.6068059460623291	0.7478164341041681	0.8374812758029313	1.3800161685689052	1.719105406630586	2.9573613484556724	5.820759885811162	
Fear and Desire is of interest mainly to Kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. Kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. He considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. This is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than "Barry Lyndon"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest, and has its genuine absorbing moments. It's a difficult film to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), though perhaps this may change if Kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.	-2.2535829487584205	-1.4761838289755913	-1.4254672343824812	-1.2759202913852283	-1.1536100051112745	-0.9855735214940182	-0.6195784320776282	-0.5874435734738918	-0.32692546871099504	-0.2872559313185393	-0.22776608196432235	-0.19352042636438893	-0.13896355541185618	0.07527287913579608	0.24869857384810676	0.2857388249687427	0.30911793244312735	0.40358204166894934	0.5044726195900414	0.5411514903436112	0.570538113197647	0.6195093299858349	0.8116547575830244	1.948822550138936	3.5095708781158073	
Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers "Thank you" to testifying officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) as he leaves the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film, you are given the explanation. You will see Mr. Cool J's devilish detective partner Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decide NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The cops in the city of "Edison" are so corrupt they shoot their suspects, steal their money, and snort their dope. Whether he's out to impress his girlfriend (herein, called "Pussy") or win a Pulitzer, the city's corruption does NOT sit well with the noble Mr. Timberlake.<br /><br />Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption, which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of danger. Writer/director David J. Burke keeps the film above water, but just barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" sweepstakes (aka the "rapper to actor" progression). Mr. McDermott has fun with his role. Lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical, but it's more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems lost).<br /><br />**** Edison (9/17/05) David J.

Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.<br /><br />If you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.<br /><br />If you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. You'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.<br /><br />Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (I didn't, BTW), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim's. Then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself, and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized. You might feel a bit annoyed at Jim for bringing this to your attention. You may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish. <br /><br />The sad truth is, much as I wanted to like this movie... I hated it. It took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason whatsoever, looked back at itself and then stopped.<br /><br />Jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one that is conveyed on screen. Jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. He discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. <br /><br />Of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. As others have said it's no Hollywood tale, it's gritty and it's real. It's well made. Life is quite a struggle at times. If anyone were to know "the answer", they do well to shout it from the rooftops.<br /><br />Still, I feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. You feel that it's going to say something, that if you just suffer through a little more of it, it'll have something to say. It'll make you stop and think. <br /><br />It doesn't.<br /><br />Again, I do submit that this is a well crafted film. And therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes. <br /><br />For the rest of us, it's utterly miss-able.	-9.091362270641191	-5.270845525554529	-5.153193749527151	-4.460839952978489	-3.6623035360733707	-3.3364688163463816	-2.3528407201793486	-0.7446084702964553	-0.7322920111817834	-0.5703026053896515	-0.5623591104885957	-0.5600368445569749	0.0200009591321284	0.3199678534676677	0.3695163620049372	0.9956607953520907	1.205953994176383	1.3623297948934028	1.6996468528276303	1.814012842328171	2.0203773002547383	2.512052924748572	2.6066519061629863	6.3389887563171925	11.38550109261168	
Nintendo!!! YOU #%$@ERS!!! How could you do this to me? I can't believe it...this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along....oh God...where do I even begin? The plot SUCKED. The voice acting SUCKED. The animation SUCKED. The ending REALLY SUCKED. If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK TOO. And to Futuramafan1987, who said this was the greatest movie ever, you are a TOOL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. This isn't a movie for anyone but crack-addled ten-year olds with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I'm still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie....and then there was Pikachu's Adventure...don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film. It is, in all truth, one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. Don't go watch this at any costs.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Go out, find every copy of this movie that you can, and burn it. Burn them all, and then proceed to rent a GOOD movie, like Aliens...or Bowling For Columbine...or even Back to the Future!	-7.03535490043521	-3.3199879207624137	-2.7359783431097573	-2.236431048488315	-2.1114580555796643	-1.6209105938361477	-1.5717354613274104	-1.3639734761000812	-1.166702541550056	-0.7815009072555826	-0.6728842080186513	-0.6333188793784426	-0.2744310230574633	-0.08250515535068698	0.15080694835940964	0.3337722740969581	0.4009541676551874	0.7248650107354043	0.9287203884479703	1.0662158405325939	1.2311532050148386	1.77772041167773	2.273462202405998	3.2431381252567237	6.705174158553496	
This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.<br /><br />I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great. The acting superb and the script should be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute.	-2.782714724448174	-1.7593420505398047	-1.7414476712133813	-1.6720800068691986	-1.5060629335142286	-0.6488300265860449	-0.5683174180468308	-0.3981063218585318	-0.3906822072982835	-0.3129848551524398	-0.24931390807876402	-0.22302744200244135	-0.19031655116365365	-0.10436011737986434	-0.0249877901459898	-0.00855474888601794	0.1121650638902045	0.2653616026692344	0.392431298349496	0.6748917668222396	0.7373063980800972	1.028948298060159	1.2611616156149392	2.136983516553263	3.1694454912560284	
Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. One man, Daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. The kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. Yes, I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. This true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents. A must see for those who care about their families.	-2.508308315675097	-1.6407578705366728	-1.1158886086932087	-0.8297127490912553	-0.46683229860961983	-0.4459404098394575	-0.1605277048812152	-0.0035714059867886783	0.0959812856917149	0.10979815557679323	0.21448339439864478	0.2631325896570492	0.35072662098958385	0.4788962437700062	0.5422587156836535	0.651573271914792	0.7249200195888881	0.7896826411916611	0.7997616458889815	1.098706177127158	1.1369055388384959	1.3222698140041866	1.3647480474688654	1.5066580284618587	2.5736334410024266	
Like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick, we plundered the Asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned. We had good reason to do so, the Asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon - the Grudge, and a Tale of Two Sisters. By the time Takashi Miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with One Missed Call in 2003, the market seemed to be drying up, leaving it open for mockery and derision, despite the continued Hollywood Remake Machine working full steam ahead. Now, don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of good Asian horrors being made, the likes of Marebito and Shutter, to mention but two, will stand as minor genre classics some day. But the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party, and was time to take that success-drunk tramp home to bed! Then along comes a film like Noroi - The Curse. A film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it's roots, yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it. What I'm about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on. He starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door, yet there is no baby there, apart from a middle aged woman and her son. These two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around, but strange other coincidences start popping up. A psychic young girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a pretty young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons, and a very sinister demon by the name of Kagutaba, leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town...<br /><br />To say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit. The film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion, and incorporates footage from TV shows and news reports, and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line. The film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the Blair Witch Project, but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night, the comparison ends there really.<br /><br />What is refreshing about Noroi is how it doesn't pander to modern horror audiences. If you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic, look elsewhere. The film's strength lies in it's slow, gradual build up of terror, a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it. The climax is pretty damned freaky, but just when you think the film is over, you get treated to the 'real' ending when the credits start to roll, and sweet holy f*ck, is it a killer. In terms of acting, it is mostly convincing. You get some 'comedy' relief from the crazy, tin foil covered clairvoyant, but that soon dries up half way through the film. The film also has a slightly 'nastier' feel than a lot of Asian ghost horror, as there is a violent streak to some of the events too.<br /><br />Overall, Noroi is one to watch on your own, late at night. Not since my first viewing of Ringu ten years ago have I been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film. It is one that will itch away at you until it is too late, then it is under your skin. Just let yourself go to this one completely. And not a lank haired ghost lady in sight?? No wonder it has barely been released outside of Japan, let alone had an American remake lined up yet. Check this one out if you can, essential viewing in my books!	-9.10639717908827	-5.112959797688141	-4.107985111889461	-3.6133983628838737	-3.471914942002583	-3.342324830882047	-2.618799065027953	-0.8686235372576108	-0.7458254576022381	-0.5336233367804063	-0.5231326284825619	-0.016571701455344923	0.3494297646617277	0.406753352048309	0.9864795871892713	1.1827861726777393	1.5385926434671682	1.5439217287879448	1.719962123941323	2.0072105753527327	2.1090413709310627	2.884645296893734	3.121121171106563	6.027040440780027	12.922699219551522	
I'm a fan of arty movies, but regretfully I have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel. Agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, trying. Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something, or enjoyed some aspect, but there there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there. The acting was OK, though the characters were utterly boring. For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal, she is mightily empty. Pity. I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic, but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.	-4.509719614978629	-2.111182060928887	-1.7372595015355836	-1.7077935166822846	-1.5726573549289316	-1.3844290337377791	-1.2357205780313518	-0.9465699118880868	-0.6419391502801131	-0.5221905076721771	-0.5089648249086803	-0.3116923588660333	-0.06532449278573042	0.0032529047514321466	0.1038500408278776	0.18674623169107754	0.2159339515904528	0.22589752306176628	0.42016797747314943	0.439031806888629	0.6263587680952905	1.1473631628284955	1.9917455166338605	2.0726719108288103	4.450942744754772	
I don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki...) someday will direct the REAL Neverending story. A great dead writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it.	-1.0053675560701554	-0.9881750056930153	-0.5346305599183782	-0.4164336509220334	-0.37969895943649884	-0.37246585476642236	-0.28192694423992093	-0.20939858663829342	-0.20848354232919303	-0.07361431018261655	-0.051078623900317074	-0.042555700780216976	0.04726741621628937	0.06890480378427122	0.11311440468492306	0.11324043824904295	0.13469590842010265	0.28444006576546915	0.3120779070887355	0.6091623520374609	0.7309568517352937	1.0366207902427638	1.0953369339744756	1.103786514156381	1.5950429723231072	
Oh dear god. This was horrible. There is bad, then there was this. This movie makes no sense at all. It runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all. The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' isn't a real city, takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only writing that was decent was'Tilman' in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. It was actually a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout. Too bad. Hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the A List.	-7.367257804211153	-2.902615637206304	-2.8388338229111008	-2.6610077995293127	-2.631853329863649	-2.4961348933338683	-2.1819723210730357	-1.1124986170422886	-0.7080704165632143	-0.4898639313971375	0.06854468837355779	0.26831362716456103	0.30333858792587903	0.3450983098915236	0.3707846681355964	0.4249472102545227	0.43197583466021366	0.4523815504489705	0.5393070760500208	0.5542918803802361	1.1568306993739876	1.5192918162350615	3.3573813425506835	3.360123817283285	7.627668749021917	
You've gotta hand it to Steven Seagal: whatever his other faults may be, he does have good taste in women. If you pick a Seagal movie, chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it. And usually, they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo of Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolie's) and Katie Jones, and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling! And if it seems like I'm spending a little too much time talking about them, it's because the rest of the movie, although passable, is so unexciting that it's hard to find much else to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as if he can't even be bothered to try to pretend to care. This being a military-type actioner, there is very little fighting in it, and he doesn't fit into his role (a stealth fighter pilot, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.

This one and the one prior "Toulon's Revenge" and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice. It is basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series. Basically, a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill, this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action Japanese shows like Ultraman. The movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie. Just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie. You do get to see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti-climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins.	-3.9883073539592027	-1.6915143950361573	-1.599866421204233	-1.4712539539506517	-1.39088575142891	-1.2932548959342935	-1.2325043042090482	-0.5007361452188086	-0.18741885550890247	-0.13559185347014208	-0.12028875016182396	0.033134220267317674	0.05551844962733872	0.06791327416605789	0.12896187586680927	0.20168814868613474	0.2890802145920379	0.3088179887843987	0.4339361792929398	0.5455435404585347	0.6564400139283034	0.6816579347567447	1.7804851732403226	1.8249786543648878	4.386741629850184	
Popular radio storyteller Gabriel No one(Robin Williams,scraggy and speaking in hushed,hypnotic tones) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand(Rory Culkin),who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents. To boot,Pete has AIDS and this compels Gabriel further still,since his partner Jess(Bobby Cannavale,good)happens to be a survivor of HIV himself. <br /><br />He also acquaints himself with Pete's guardian,a woman named Donna(Toni Collette,brilliant!)and when Gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to Wisconsin,he discovers some secrets he was(naturally)not prepared to find.<br /><br />Based on real events that happened to Armistead Maupin(who co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Anderson)and directed by Patrick Stetner,this film moves a lot faster(90 min.,maybe a few minutes longer)than one might think a movie of this genre would run. That's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. It's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story. I'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that,if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's works or his personal story,you feel a little bit out of the loop here. Still,the performances by Williams( I would've loved to heard more of his narration,personally),Collette,Cannavale,Culkin and much of the supporting cast(the Waitress at the restaurant Collete's Donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has!)are top-notch and the mood established here--namely,the chilly,lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York--give a terrific framing for this story. It may have ends that don't tie together particularly well,but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with.	-2.3589784099962032	-2.2368516926185973	-2.0631697445619483	-2.0018034457161997	-1.114201024952406	-1.0484838637019727	-0.7687187528386704	-0.32855982757305424	-0.1965546104113599	-0.18552826004614387	-0.04911715904866204	-0.0029751995036034623	0.12935941382407873	0.26756547304698747	0.450233019074714	0.7162214740822648	0.8244383707022332	0.9325988519358853	1.1275971625855368	1.1294364378939536	1.2582706855110037	1.3223927404736975	2.9241851539340007	3.08678502823702	4.401233293170804	
I had to see this on the British Airways plane. It was terribly bad acting and a dumb story. Not even a kid would enjoy this.

The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure. First and foremost, it is a good story. Though my four children's primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end. The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal, judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say, "He's c-u-t-e!" <br /><br />In 1940, the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, those effects seem very dated ("Look, it's Barbie flying through the air," declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying). Yet they fit into the story well. The film is, after all, over 60 years old. The effects fit with the script. Furthermore, what ones sees in The Thief of Bagdad remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years. One need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In that, it was quite an achievement.<br /><br />This qualifies as a family film, though there are a few stabbings near the end. The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation.<br /><br />All in all, a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.	-4.81929861146463	-3.853418464305507	-2.3579493828597142	-1.9232034347906182	-1.6319928644194164	-0.40805697449819844	-0.28305759385024415	-0.16237764105957453	-0.09896212136530777	0.24165420338522486	0.30192790702657907	0.49119822144593994	0.7354251096027044	0.8362417478253865	0.8640849484435535	0.9813107969717636	1.1202383332053645	1.2454278953731233	1.4279785686763018	1.5767696524053494	1.80886055949726	1.9895755592374789	2.873447412769459	3.706115410741055	5.490705792143443	
No wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie. It's just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch. Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction. Students fist-fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue. The Watts riots with a cast of...ugh...10?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a Mary Hartman look-alike with the most annoying smile since 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift. Drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service. Silly, giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of 'Shindig', sing horribly off key, and actually make it big in the music business. And who wrote this compelling dialog?: "I'm going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair"...."I think I found someone to buy Stick's woody!"...."These people are 'animals'!" "These people are my 'family'! as the Shirelles sing "Mama Said". Oh brother, What a mess. This is like a 'Reefer Madness' of the 60's except it's not even funny.	-7.789121723929656	-3.5081467297061715	-3.2041380337732708	-3.1468673416963724	-2.974377910479774	-2.2251247710844844	-1.814040749845009	-0.8968507096353695	-0.8315255145037422	-0.7522942398201437	-0.43088247805996194	-0.24813721914073505	0.2736316420027218	0.2913603801388936	0.30523411706721004	0.4012736121306015	0.5383915750810278	0.7223478010654085	0.7987042145496043	0.8540005942221703	1.2120971792507043	1.3127315716871186	3.2001973298736344	3.8280197693680726	7.829677251101673	
Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made-for-TV but isn't. Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things), it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things. Like... remembering to lock your front door when you go out. Or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower.<br /><br />Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a cop with personal issues (don't they all). Together with her new partner (a wet-looking Ben Chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling).<br /><br />The crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless. Bullock, though she is very nice to look at, is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield (actually, he'd be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as the conniving sneering suspects, acquit themselves adequately. As if dodgy leads weren't bad enough, a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run.<br /><br />"Murder By Numbers" has absolutely nothing going for it, even a pointless nude scene by Bullock wouldn't redeem it. Well, just a little but still not enough to save it. Forgettable, predictable and redundant - this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward. As Cassie probably says on her next case, there's nothing to see here people. Move along, keep moving...	-6.920145264166969	-3.219078988725833	-2.7306436240491925	-2.628788980628564	-2.5040215295848145	-2.199349725778312	-1.618785550722569	-0.9160475197965531	-0.5777904016640376	-0.5425058326785782	-0.4844231344057298	-0.3012707973033517	0.029872690509861553	0.1567340677308256	0.5452645602102217	0.5592532908263719	0.6322075133112252	0.7214785304058637	0.9223448017210096	1.197010799125295	1.3057062384165363	1.5329245408884238	2.153651306410942	3.000386350258544	7.570945053265957	
I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was, (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc. I hope to see more movies from Tucker and Chan in their separate endeavors, but not in any more Rush Hour sequels. It's just too tired. I recommend a rental, but not a purchase.	-2.3465685801472445	-2.287367135877622	-1.879396348446592	-1.4586810492006763	-1.180470625455995	-1.0701544723105298	-0.8339511312691439	-0.6755457207867688	-0.17653390717917067	-0.026571600835099463	0.03314430105035163	0.06104202206281145	0.1472868145406506	0.16973382737816478	0.24808183966199754	0.27228523195224585	0.46922258073171247	0.4729445434789566	0.5803617627344647	0.6951909333939835	0.7873675491758736	0.8527360344865826	1.2128182762988542	2.580399477761728	4.219196967904127	
I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but neither was I expecting it to be so awful. I hated the mother character so much I had to turn the channel. I turned it back, hoping it was just one part of the movie, but no. And for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed, or almost done out of a job, or driven to madness inside her own home? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother but I'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in MY house. I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all.<br /><br />I didn't buy any of it. I tried giving it several chances, I really did.

[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]<br /><br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: Jon killed it. Jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store. He ended up feeling down in the mouth. Literally. The laundromat was no prize either when Jon and his would-be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear. Jon tried to act all buff at the beach, but soon he angered a real buff guy, which left Jon feeling, once again, down in the mouth. Literally. Jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. No avail. Jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat, a fat man walked up and stomped Jon's guitar. It was hopeless.<br /><br /> Fortunately for Jon, an ad flashed on the TV: an ad for Lorenzo's School for the Personality Impaired. It guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building didn't exactly look the same way it did on TV, nor did Lorenzo act as peppy as he did on TV. Jon sat next to a pretty girl named Mona. So while Lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself, checking your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona get to know one another. They leave together, forgetting all about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona just sat on the porch and talked. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear that she would take Jon away from him. Garfield envisioned the future: Jon and Mona get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling Garfield's tale. Back to the present, Garfield would not stand for it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other every now and then, and Garfield was sure to be with them.<br /><br /> Another hilarious Garfield TV special! This one was made during the run of TV's Garfield and Friends. Garfield was slimmed down somewhat. SOMEwhat. Since hie early 1980's cartoons. The scenes of Jon trying to pick up chicks is funny, so is the one where the fat guy stomps on Jon's guitar. Good ol' Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (The third man of 1,000 voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The woman of 1,000 voices) is Mona. If you like Garfield, then I recommend you see Garfield Gets A Life today! It, along with Here Comes Garfield, and Garfield on the Town, were just released on DVD! So check them all out today! You are guaranteed a good time.

How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.<br /><br />But the the third one has no point!! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry's on from JP2 and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous 2 films! for example: 1) The "new" mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell!! This thing follows them everywhere they go, they cannot escape it's presence and yet in The lost world (the same island) do you see it once? do you hear it? does anyone even MENTION it? NO! Its ridiculous!. The star character in the previous 2 movies was, and always will be the T-Rex so what does the d(urr)irector "Joe Johnston" go and do? Kill it off! as soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again - a new Dino on the town is the excuse.. where did it come from!!?? not a single explanation! and don't get me started on the whole satellite-phone-in-the-Dino-belly thing! 2)Just when you start to get over how stupid the Spinosaurus is you see the Raptors, Aside from their new "Punk" Haircuts they seem pretty credible! *Phew* they will make this movie watchable right?... WRONG! now they speak to each other!! and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the First and second are...wait for it... Evolution! - yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended, amazing! surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now!! OK i am not going to say anymore about the plot because it's getting up my nose, so i will close on this: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this Monstrosity (no pun intended) Avoid this movie like the plague	-6.699403714330311	-5.03332439684808	-4.648402560699933	-2.972913375584136	-1.3609896384400102	-1.1684575426535055	-0.9951068447156843	-0.8891649077739074	-0.5123342838635448	-0.4214966590925203	-0.3340852859954452	-0.2456038786354584	-0.1741980288775205	0.28885854561894886	0.46492194735419035	0.6754757465473814	0.866472872619112	1.0065831514112464	1.1320749450732364	1.2619420344379044	1.6369255050551432	1.6575254452547743	2.056473280414546	4.6101256857484625	8.508505256623877	
Never viewed this film until recently on TCM and found this story concerning Poland and a small town which had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other European Cities for example: Norway. The First World War was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which War always creates. Alexander Knox, ( Wilhelm Gimm)"Gorky Park" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town. He was brought up a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either. As the Hitler party grew to power Wilhelm Grimm desired to become a Nazi in order to return and punish this small Polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind. Marsha Hunt,(Marja Pacierkowski),"Chloe's Prayer", played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this film, and like this subject matter, give it some of your time; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly.	-4.33619871107513	-2.1976282828080644	-2.110436547786282	-1.7701611760945783	-1.5906951605179827	-1.3745132888365337	-0.6619938246230355	-0.6119820272154506	-0.5483337337899483	-0.5296800665300341	-0.16534166910301215	-0.14439503412548815	-0.050353698118750595	0.11827282234706896	0.15890397459872263	0.19497256025263746	0.43625604767540815	0.442817668775074	0.5916627791045029	0.7743264477641398	0.9034351401878812	1.0099695499156052	1.289868895482393	2.4509740368481507	4.750694258280755	
It could not have come from a different country nor from a different time. This movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s Italian cinema. So, pseudo serious and sexually free. Sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight. Plus we get the lovely Dagmar Lassander, surely at her very best looking. The kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the Mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time. You were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings. It might have been better if Philippe Leroy didn't look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression. He does well though and has many silent moments where Dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate. Not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different, this is certainly that.	-2.0741348396139845	-1.90910250844776	-1.8090473654964967	-1.4722082274397124	-0.6577601137614857	-0.6471992517033006	-0.5319756881250253	-0.40113834027153283	-0.2193665633017377	0.015325865179458664	0.077282915844336	0.12023948212526887	0.1512727329402696	0.2353692525772944	0.3092810555572644	0.32595702078050526	0.4025079169756489	0.5703882437746594	0.5815510314251813	0.6983943679922568	0.8806133843943235	1.0843638793460537	2.185952525543172	2.2505055989364573	4.045377322252698	
This formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. He responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from Knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by John Russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. The plot could have been tightened. <br /><br />High points of the film: seeing "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without a mustache singing "Man in the Saddle"; Alfonso Bedoya's too brief scenes as a cook; the color photography of the high country, and the fight scene there with John Russell.	-3.205509474631424	-1.7793184118979608	-1.4726090276531165	-1.332891779613933	-1.1338312560562094	-0.901880388387873	-0.7007035908506256	-0.6196394356443593	-0.5590422839945286	-0.4491677441752663	-0.41806757676570305	-0.2407948466131486	-0.03684317181944462	-0.017947815687440485	0.02763143448525916	0.08733343566981777	0.4080491891465829	0.4356165985929196	0.5073401926191506	0.521978391474569	0.5233667121828776	0.6149782080694007	1.373504134771782	1.6408568329134519	3.2454641287802106	
We so often talk of cinema landmarks - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. One film however is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. I am talking of course about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.)<br /><br />This film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by US imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu.<br /><br />It also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history (until of course Queen's breathtaking work on Flash Gordon). Although a bit of a rarity, this film is well worth seeking out - it will repay the effort of your search ten-fold.	-1.0084235594920063	-0.9071578417182903	-0.8748152448967006	-0.5639550334591829	-0.2827261318879061	-0.2606419419614472	-0.1453892066007776	-0.13191539432228716	0.019646479278233778	0.04733016906312859	0.05843133549249725	0.06215571835543804	0.08108812852820066	0.09868238326102544	0.10780725368000746	0.14578871530162937	0.20365921639439044	0.2041016197741092	0.2829095473163724	0.2913845475298078	0.34708135121920897	0.5571863885375198	0.8163459929912358	1.0302063701431872	1.9570577658770874	
If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a "thriller" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to actually finish "starting". It never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all of the violence of "No Country for Old Men" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters. Thrill-killers run amok. The acting is good, mostly, but the script is a pile. Don't bother, and tell your friends to don't bother.	-1.4694013092032248	-1.3199453151650935	-1.0713477755488832	-1.0411436629204807	-0.9210528614196865	-0.4583062069532139	-0.40719704578674104	-0.3198170842409052	-0.3173724730736251	-0.25414056609157754	-0.19023880194508147	-0.14621808701558103	-0.1462047936149712	-0.025625517351771515	-0.02180820213150189	-0.017765961633886412	0.15309723401582664	0.22262473489822826	0.6332539097354478	0.6932485407820118	1.0605352600761586	1.2061388564708684	1.395237317760925	1.677975375905085	1.9902027088635985	
After having watched "Guinea Pig", two questions come in mind ( besides 'Am I really a psychopath to watch that ?' ) : 'Is it a snuff ?' The answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie I've ever seen. And then : 'Where the hell have they found that girl ?'. Because she gets tortured for '45 min, without any reasons given ( in fact, there is nothing else in this movie !) : Fingernails teared off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested by maggots, ... and many more until the final scene ( I'm still not sure how they did that ). Because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene', it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money. So what were her ( their ) motivations ?<br /><br />I saw it in japonese without subtitles, but it's not a problem ( no real dialogues, the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes ). I haven't seen yet all the serial, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known for being the best one. Still I've rated 8, because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff, the issue is quite good ( ask Charlie Sheen, the actor ). But I think they could have gone further, which they did in the following ones.<br /><br />Another movie I'm hiding from my parents.<br /><br />8/10	-6.543037172482822	-2.7779491743453124	-2.7024527691211837	-2.253715053288053	-2.1698508107945957	-1.803678129598081	-1.394686454075191	-0.6054203118498512	-0.47538440751655375	-0.3582845971980979	-0.2051378304958091	-0.10673760717012662	0.028545859906128963	0.1928067738949422	0.22713043155644236	0.3759855524954237	0.4115952744429105	0.4273292079376383	0.558424014370155	0.6187407166758698	0.7396181771084841	0.9436859324514586	3.0221716755527503	3.4682107010865804	6.944476710683496	
Where do I begin, its one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited bed?? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story. Still though, if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early, having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day, a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things, so far everything's normal. Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fishy, why didn't they bring or buy a g*d damn bed frame before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved...or so they thought. The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe. The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up.(one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old, yuck) The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered (which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill) and decide to get the hell out of dodge. While packing up, the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her.<br /><br />Well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing.......WHY THE HELL DIDN'T THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW???? Seriously, they never said anything about the actual house being haunted, just the bed....so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth. The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol "oh lets give this place a chance honey" scheme going, so props to that. Still though, me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes....why didn't they just throw the bed out? Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something.<br /><br />All in all its a near-watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot (to an extent) but the solution is so simple you're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be? The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can't shoot her like that.<br /><br />4 out of 10 (a low budget porno The Man Show would love)	-11.17981373041985	-4.381867873209464	-3.762128647292332	-3.6575050371487614	-3.0950521137031415	-2.973451213069334	-2.8860942576607713	-1.6458884738946473	-1.224365639623418	-0.9805497200308988	-0.7089814263940112	-0.1399034897370455	0.12794461028357854	0.1306324372007035	0.25529080136863735	0.2757206044844302	0.5440292799213726	0.8766148937895463	1.1421858120456605	1.1669186217747098	1.2082135387544077	2.319676108807627	4.6604120680812064	4.79958153788039	11.21557798062779	
I absolutely loved this show. Never understood why it was called Bug Juice though. I must have been about 13 when it came out. I remember they ran it over the summer holidays on channel 4, between re-runs of Pugwalls summer and Saved by the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there and wishing i was at summer camp too - ha ha. All the kids in it looked to be having so much fun, it was all about "discovering who you are" and "growing up." First kisses and all that stuff. I remember there was this really cute guy in it, i think he was the main reason i got up in the mornings that particular summer.

Sammi Cheng & Andy Lau are coupled yet again in their 3rd film -- YESTERDAY ONCE MORE -- directed by HK's actioneer Johnnie To...fans of To's action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming...furthermore, fans of Cheng & Lau's previous films, NEEDING YOU & LOVE ON A DIET, will also be disappointed to find that YESTERDAY is no where near as funny or endearing...<br /><br />Mr. & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) are a divorced couple...both affluent HK citizens...both incredibly mischievous...both just happened to be professional thieves -- 'two birds of the same feather'....A couple years earlier, they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the loot...Now she's remarrying...to the son of a rich heiress -- a total momma's boy (Carl Ng) through & through...The soon-to-be mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) is suspicious of Mrs. To's past & thinks she's only marrying her son for the family jewels -- the heiress' priceless ruby necklace...<br /><br />The necklace is stolen...is it Mrs. To's materialistic eye that gets the best of her?... or is it her ex-husband, Mr. To's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself?...<br /><br />This is not a movie about two pple falling in love or rekindling a love...its about two pple who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it...they let pride & greed overwhelm them...<br /><br />Overall: YESTERDAY is one part caper/heist film & one part homage to classic Hollywood glamour from its golden years -- i.e. Cary Grant & Grace Kelly's TO CATCH A THIEF...Johnnie To is riding too heavily on Cheng/Lau's chemistry from their previous films...hoping Cheng/Lau's immense popularity & fan base will be enough justification for this third film....I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most likable/charming entertainers working t'day...& Lau is definitely the Tom Cruise of Asian cinema...<br /><br />I really enjoyed their first two films & consider the Cheng/Lau pairing comparable to those classic Hollywood couples of the 40's & 50's...but YESTERDAY falls very short of expectations...terrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements galore, & all the subplots & supporting characters were unnecessary...come to think of it...this film was unnecessary...unless you just love celebrity watching...	-2.1535423212090237	-1.1891934977311054	-1.1694302386772384	-1.1274609312414694	-1.0856011771833005	-0.7096526327854519	-0.48026022331344687	-0.3699144747451306	-0.29238927159518724	-0.18197366431745945	-0.1638270748038827	-0.10301856632618873	-0.07585776037235364	-0.005470194931417732	8.087341972363993E-4	0.1692266123944124	0.20076763980021478	0.24173464940682526	0.2519921292003062	0.3137169138702063	0.46486938748518664	0.5566664573918596	1.1221871688360758	1.3427799912497111	2.157337010792012	
First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sporty type" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this movie.	-3.2225284995082237	-1.9306851830037	-1.7732816475247866	-1.7114902120929956	-1.5619737852013762	-1.2326357967934545	-0.7983092704359807	-0.3956863057706309	-0.35220528128494105	-0.3270363518031884	-0.09503105816525943	-0.053979523975561855	-0.01191477192898463	0.05871135818932566	0.3395100110553085	0.35082132859756215	0.427232401303127	0.4779320644250126	0.5000242720854344	0.5995426476789854	0.7136090109696767	0.953959796555912	1.1786467949507777	2.483032076318464	4.262425508947656	
I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading A Winkle in Time, and would think, what an amazing movie this would make. Sadly enough that screenwriter failed, changing characters, throwing in lame humor, and all out destroying the plot. I know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie. But why can't you stay true to the book? Why must you change the way characters think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft couch, and let your imagination run wild.	-1.8058181534369924	-1.3926587139614315	-1.2576277697960676	-1.1896476033879155	-0.8180763836963002	-0.6588734174369159	-0.48057819630079524	-0.40050844102637645	-0.34501919271292986	-0.16457343450156117	0.06931777864615331	0.07609176274451097	0.09082907207261845	0.1535779871350467	0.16662423108708174	0.25612490385445097	0.31829693281099736	0.475974042160475	0.6786385145310765	0.6820849345007881	0.760905623095796	0.980510490604993	1.9700856105754998	2.227836092608427	3.2086249232938444	
This production was quite good. The usual fabulous scenery, interesting, quirky characters. It was just so strange not to have Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Poirot's office/residence, so prominently featured in the original PBS/BBC mysteries.<br /><br />In the original series, so much took place at the office. Hastings reading the paper, while Poirot "exercises his little gray cells." Miss Lemon pitching in whenever needed.<br /><br />Poirot without Capt. Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson ... he can most certainly solve the crime, but it is not as interesting.<br /><br />And what would a Poirot mystery be without Hastings, with his impeccable manners, falling for some beautiful, unattainable woman.	-1.5600549967470183	-1.0537617290912478	-0.9904649317446084	-0.8235891114430763	-0.727581943087763	-0.476634426000361	-0.42018483680292784	-0.3013072011421009	-0.23372276091473843	-0.23010390354578542	-0.2107227377679482	-0.1321026228399407	-0.1299022533274215	0.02965595777826055	0.04409909785663257	0.1443564229514432	0.24647702688167153	0.3936799424483131	0.6700530526397909	0.7007943801224401	0.8744623016996631	0.9106892946652214	1.165312236518289	1.5933519372344664	2.520287100844295	
From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognised the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics. Basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. The plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. Adequate!	-3.6091401716541744	-1.8481923320621654	-1.6695111359285302	-1.488789978827146	-1.4875048603166006	-0.8235566738246425	-0.5829221636685433	-0.557030516898156	-0.46147226449751066	-0.3245994684397874	-0.28828866408864007	-0.24470890991879465	-0.20429274690344196	-0.11750991658473878	-0.09755689100960084	-0.08409264141846805	0.023061951076699838	0.2108789385031597	0.39059598272897256	0.48869483521616564	0.7829041821840327	0.7998832261798479	1.0680560045661858	1.7817696225534359	3.532578704962662	
The scintillating Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (current day Sri Lanka). Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd. William Dieterle, who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie , does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark, and almost eerie, undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery.	-0.7372963398928192	-0.6554753556185526	-0.630437133830674	-0.5425899184575934	-0.3461155879101291	-0.2794484632019441	-0.19558999510275304	-0.024417174736628168	0.008874918788427527	0.009995587742790968	0.010573304304422168	0.036271057080426106	0.14688876749203716	0.21931153264630943	0.29844528134528436	0.30460525868073546	0.3590648037676082	0.38778357397844926	0.5157060581687086	0.5199775098409931	0.6864777548760653	0.7980439722143813	0.9560310917148604	0.9821974033671812	1.3110010985449503	
I'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. My first thought when seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring I would be seeing something from MGM which did musicals best at that time. Boy was I wrong and disappointed.<br /><br />One Touch Of Venus which starred Mary Martin, Kenny Baker, and John Boles on Broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker, and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin, Baker, and Boles did on stage. The Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a comeback vehicle for Mary Martin who reestablished herself as the Queen of Broadway after a disappointing venture in Hollywood. <br /><br />Look at the names that went into this show. Given who was responsible for the book I expected to see some sparkling wit in this production. Instead I got a rather pedestrian screenplay, it was like all the wit was drained out of it. Doing her best to make up for it is Eve Arden playing her usual girl Friday role with Tom Conway, but it's even too much for Eve.<br /><br />The story concerns department store window dresser Robert Walker who kisses a very valuable statue of Venus who springs to life in the person of Ava Gardner. Of course when the statue goes missing, Conway yells for the law and is suspicious of Walker, the last person to be with the statue. <br /><br />The rest of the film is Walker dealing with Gardner and what will happen to both of them. For reasons I don't understand, Ava was of course dubbed by Eileen Wilson and Walker sings only a couple of lines. The singing is carried by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan playing Walker's friends and coworkers. Of course on Broadway the songs were done by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. You would kind of think that Haymes would be playing Walker's role at least. It was awkward to say the least.<br /><br />Only three songs survived from the score, Don't Look Now, But My Heart Is Showing, That's Him, and the incomparable Speak Low. Haymes's silken baritone is shown to best advantage in Speak Low which was sung as a duet by Martin and Baker on Broadway. For some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century, Ogden Nash, were done over by Ann Ronnell. I suspect the infamous Code was at work here.<br /><br />In Lee Server's biography of Ava Gardner he makes mention of a brief fling Ava had with Robert Walker when she had had a spat with her current man, Howard Duff. When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it badly and didn't speak at all to Gardner off camera. I'm sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn't help matters either.<br /><br />Hopefully some repertoire company will do One Touch Of Venus and you'll get to see it the way, Weill, Nash, and Perelman wrote it.	-11.709537129389492	-5.014591724838625	-3.981560645683715	-3.9482572891269823	-3.339401961597457	-3.10984207198723	-2.193043555382447	-1.8287406388505947	-1.2517188633383556	-1.0830974910755753	-0.9638187981484878	-0.07307457499993407	0.4864744669419224	0.6008361196824252	0.806395203784011	0.8153491621203038	1.1175479455084458	1.1434850505133438	1.3531849028044636	1.5236296962581124	1.8584651433726926	2.188390360298174	3.808773287246708	5.287965014764938	11.661326583202653	
Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be.<br /><br />The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time. But after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be.<br /><br />A word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. This is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood.<br /><br />If you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. And don't forget to switch the light off.<br /><br />My points on different aspects:-<br /><br />Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10<br /><br />Total = 9/10	-2.9155052856182877	-2.0542834063541044	-2.050607661697264	-1.5738914486525126	-1.4881394969374395	-1.0297564519219495	-0.9086560236702629	-0.3174461355882805	-0.3143813942502043	-0.278875768686902	-0.06330686592975492	0.0014899370272018903	0.07100573869703841	0.11488716151816322	0.19187845046808727	0.29384008150267843	0.3406369623917388	0.567331443369063	0.7048597240878739	0.7305962575958909	1.0059301545143038	1.196120022253461	1.370188837397962	2.5742669435754566	3.9999658901456803	
One year after 'Love Thy Neighbour' made its I.T.V. debut, it followed the route taken by 'On The Buses' and 'Steptoe & Son' by graduating onto the big screen, in a picture made by Hammer Films. It opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of England's green and pleasant land, then cuts to a shot of Eddie and Bill walking up a street, arguing furiously. This escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each other's homes. At least the original theme tune is retained ( even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies ).<br /><br />The local paper - 'The Gazette' - is holding a contest to find the best neighbours, the winners landing a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests to Joan that they should enter. The thing is, can Bill and Eddie stay friends long enough to win it? That's the main part of the plot. The film is by and large episodic. One chunk is lifted directly from Season 1, namely Bill and Eddie going to the Club pretending to be on 'union business'. In reality they're going to see a stripper ( not meeting two girls ). Another portion of the movie has Bill, along with other black factory workers ( in the series he was the only one ), breaking a strike Eddie has helped bring about by various ploys ( including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels ). While another ( seemingly inspired by Powell and Driver's 'For The Love Of Ada' ) sees Eddie's talkative mother ( the magnificent Patricia Hayes ) getting friendly with Bill's father ( Charles Hyatt ).<br /><br />The climax to Episode 1 Season 1 reappears in an expanded form. Bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify Eddie, but his friends join him, and they dance round a drum containing a naked Booth, so that they can pretend to cook and eat him. Eddie then has to make his way home in the nude ( surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in Episode 2 Season 2 ).<br /><br />The film ends with the Reynolds and the Booths winning the 'Love Thy Neighbour' contest, and taking the cruise together, but there's an unexpected twist involving Joan's sex-mad brother Cyril ( James Beck - 'Private Walker' of 'Dad's Army' ), who is working as a steward.<br /><br />This is your typical '70's sitcom-into-movie, with all the faults usually prevalent in such films. The laughs are scattered about, and interest wanes after about half an hour. The cast is augmented by familiar faces such as Melvyn Hayes ( cast as 'Terry', a character from Episode 2 Season 1, played on that occasion by Leslie Meadows ), Bill Fraser ( as the factory manager ), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence ( who seems to have been in every '70's British comedy film, mostly cast as nymphomaniacs ), and Arthur English. The director, John Robins, was also responsible for the 'Man About The House' movie.<br /><br />Funniest moment - while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face black. The first he knows of it is when the manager's secretary screams in terror.

"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow moving B-flick in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation. A mediocre film at best, "EG in B" features some members of the band Chicago, a whiff of action, some philosophizing, and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler. Not worth the time.	-1.420651291794737	-0.8593585846013777	-0.8490097018682681	-0.7345553854558093	-0.6649325376207423	-0.6201551392340794	-0.5505261144247179	-0.23810749996994895	-0.18044990694066534	-0.14409217615754488	-0.13972933169529403	-0.13821354744700806	-0.10769922364237854	-0.05958863026319494	-0.013330333980701438	0.07875822713116115	0.13700000209025148	0.18230380977779348	0.26879335702858387	0.28874642481188767	0.3116605149356302	0.39452524803936406	0.44975071969380126	0.87481087052154	1.5704976760777007	
This is one of the best episode from the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women... He kill'em all, they are often the victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, I don't remember the Argento's episode in season 1, etc., obviously Imprint). I think he enjoys to watch women been burn, torture, mutilated and I don't know. Never least "Right to die" is one of the best, with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense (specially with the photos from the cell scene, wonderful). The acting is like the entire series, regular I could be worst like "Pro-life" or "We scream for Ice cream". Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible, killing and terminating women, mutilating animals and on and on... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like "Cigarrette burns" (The best of all), "Homecoming" (The most funny), "Imprint" (really shocking).	-2.2476892906700727	-1.6187872685452525	-1.481796299882788	-1.2861796496177416	-1.2190902291361496	-0.5176987945603431	-0.5034419932854735	-0.37890624915674914	-0.34957066694737265	-0.3282147025117087	-0.28314775786367374	-0.21896221879277342	-0.17827253952249206	-0.146685787914229	-0.12380516241651482	-0.05215747837682427	0.2241279036217349	0.3359784030788541	0.6627797002147437	0.7053249263477217	0.7107572935270767	1.257121892164566	1.2726274008531495	1.9363104152543515	3.0796854250453563	
If you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. It can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!	-1.3942756570078425	-0.8446347479531079	-0.7169468538348288	-0.6968966720501871	-0.5523824682083192	-0.3328431577369788	-0.27554859172554286	-0.2498767610030303	-0.12535189033816174	0.0018013844719983498	0.09983402302590982	0.11844544195850004	0.20063245297819132	0.20661413037493825	0.21124042736309745	0.22877290430270242	0.23177314945500774	0.2556327651102055	0.433456516157643	0.4653534760746145	0.4848113682257035	0.5597920916425567	1.119369688220448	1.6418465818888828	1.8632412896048318	
This would've been a *great* silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, I'm Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way.<br /><br />Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!<br /><br />Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away. This dialogue might've worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.<br /><br />If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.<br /><br />This script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.<br /><br />IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled "weighted score". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.<br /><br />Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn't character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. That's a plot contrivance.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted. Perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.<br /><br />Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his dangly male "look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man" glory.<br /><br />Don't say you weren't warned.	-7.721078592124992	-4.917043586878334	-4.461448141570899	-3.2000641421351164	-2.7920349089012753	-2.4181286403978284	-2.278783570427005	-0.7994621204345931	-0.646696694897417	-0.14666394105306757	0.13284990085838116	0.19512464673070762	0.262400362661366	0.4316095467416759	0.8768143970844166	0.96054601667357	1.0028405912239184	1.1601008428202888	1.1821262193804667	1.646110620324748	1.6996839267784178	2.0257684299435748	2.813571993554324	5.145640983111754	9.984767072964662	
Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent, who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble. I must admit i'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his movies. He stinks. However when compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas' comatose wife Kinmont, Lamas seems like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw CIA because of the renewed interest around the O.J Simpson trial, you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels, you couldn't escape this movie. in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable TV. The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor. Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic? <br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)	-4.62679230315379	-1.8891418899122379	-1.7150762187044934	-1.5878453236081116	-1.3826864988523093	-1.317876229552727	-0.9704534050564022	-0.6510796252606947	-0.3838973231154649	-0.25670969512628744	-0.219901385715551	-0.015397754004411561	0.002373727874899978	0.18129068426449413	0.3627665343973578	0.44290820734125813	0.4742978553267792	0.4745222325302934	0.5202585426392723	0.5981167347822832	0.6815499548064079	0.7133919289238657	1.444080099765728	2.1420077637177117	5.121464181721562	
There are many good things about the new BSG: There's the multiple Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6, for example, which the two actresses played superbly. There's the old school feel of industrial design aboard Galactica ("My ship will not be networked, over my dead body!") Also, all the space battles, the special effects (even though the seasoned sci-fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all) The darkness of the characters, their essentially flawed nature.<br /><br />That makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish.<br /><br />Yes, the first part, the scenes in space, the raid on the Cylons and all that was very good. But the mushy ending? I always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden, so I never know how much time is left until the end. So for me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end happen over and over again. Every time I thought, oh this is the final scene, the final shot, I got one more. Every frakking character got its complete ending! That wasn't really necessary.<br /><br />What really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all: The young Roslin scenes. Why is important for us to know that: {a} she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and {b} that she has a one night stand with a former pupil/student? What does that bring to the story? Where was the linkage? Now, I'm all for a more European-ish style approach, and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows, and all that, but this was just ridiculous. This didn't bring anything meaningful to the story.<br /><br />Also, I've seen the "Last Frakkin special" and in it Ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot: he couldn't come up with a good ending for the story, so .... he just didn't! It's never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be. The whole "this was thousands of years in the past" idea, the mitochondrial Eve thing, was also used in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and believe you me, there are a lot of BSG watchers who know that particular H2G2 storyline. And speaking of Hera, now there's a storyline that WAS NOT worked out well, AT ALL. Instead we get Roslin is doing her former pupil who's 20 years younger. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for older women with younger men. The more power to them. But this ... just made no sense.<br /><br />All in all, (the writing in) this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be. That goes even moreso for the last episode. I hope Lost and 24 do better, with their series finales.	-9.501454906783627	-5.543194075226602	-3.6906630634707707	-3.6014743200861945	-3.134720971885761	-2.90877432772276	-2.2957250879423974	-0.8594336098329577	-0.723693648974559	0.012715499295079691	0.10435706442354281	0.18354295966504797	0.20670334642093788	0.2222711716090222	0.24885632158593204	0.6942481238929228	1.1652265442695287	1.3089473831125662	1.8073405622119427	2.3565430482999044	2.5795126681564158	2.911615063992071	3.702277700984931	6.27449808582863	12.706132815428159	
Wow, I was really disappointed. I wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater, and I wish I stuck to that plan. It really should be a made-for-tv movie. I was kind of excited to see it, as I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do her justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. What a horrible cover up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. <br /><br />There was no flow to the movie, it was very hard to get into it. One scene we get angry, hyped up, we want blood, the anticipation rises, just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been more enjoyable to follow if it was broken up into three sectional sunday paper comic strip.<br /><br />There was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts. The gangster leaders were scrawny guys, not very believable. Matt Dillon head of a mobster organization? Come on, give me a break. There was just no intimidation there. <br /><br />The soundtrack.. wow. I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard. What awful guitar solos, my god. The sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends, I'm sure. <br /><br />Anyhow, there is one positive comment I'd like to make about the movie. The settings were nicely done. I liked the colours, a good job conveying that time period.	-8.665731202029338	-5.076686207780786	-4.969423866910898	-4.149454682671009	-3.6360720177271655	-2.2685664206225087	-1.3701457915490154	-1.331571231582381	-0.9703233891880908	-0.6410928559159559	-0.19102646200597045	-0.0768073991048005	-0.03900748271720153	0.14974396907909948	0.1577691214580946	0.489185867877159	0.5021124184618786	1.111293654637406	1.5058379958168628	1.7144479488583608	1.7905287184008623	1.9143840554505935	2.2833442610414005	6.100956645315227	10.381001055386545

too bad this movie isn't. While "Nemesis Game" is mildly entertaining, I found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie, especially the situations that Sara was putting herself into. Are we supposed to believe that:<br /><br />1) this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles?<br /><br />2) the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun, but don't put the whole "I Never Sinned" riddle together until the very end...and then...and then...get this...she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together?? I know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on, but do they really think we're that stupid?<br /><br />3) when Vern and Sara go to the Chez M to question the blonde, there is not ONE topless chick in the whole building. Nada. C'mon. I know it's Canada, but I would expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Tweed.<br /><br />And anyone else notice that when Vern was surfing the Web and found that riddlezone site, that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow, and didn't turn into a little hand (LIKE ALL CURSORS DO WHEN YOU CLICK ON A HYPERLINK)?!? I mean, if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie, at least get the little things right.

The fourth "Tremors" feature goes back in time, to the year 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small city of "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly "Graboids". Some of the characters in the present-day "Tremors" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is inept with firearms; so, he hires gunslinger Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot 'em up some "Dirt Dragons".<br /><br />This one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster "Graboids". These tamer "Dirt Dragons" are nowhere near as terrorizing as their "Tremors" (1990) counterparts. Consequently, in this film, the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie. And, it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly, when Gross temporarily decides to leave town. Why so helpless? Why didn't Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) immediately rally the people to fight without Gross? Disappointing.<br /><br />**** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S.

In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a party. Meanwhile, they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears. A serial killer, who is listening to their confessions, makes their nightmares come true, killing each one of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday, 13th. Then, the story shifts to a bar, where seven friends are celebrating Halloween. From this moment on, the story has a great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of C production. However, the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan, giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting. With a better beginning and conclusion, this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")	-3.0944684547011514	-1.523197895426266	-1.5202832421469183	-1.501980142070473	-1.286181525424877	-1.0354003108076881	-0.7476211471901548	-0.6869223180587424	-0.5691999718269136	-0.3120516971118418	-0.2938898743166222	-0.16310898322493633	-0.025164124332230094	2.6571916924284476E-4	0.026995835290554805	0.24687561743474978	0.3607439043956298	0.6874643549588159	0.7127256890904347	0.7776853924787899	0.8109059778399434	0.8783878282816887	0.8905551266584362	1.8104573513025644	4.234105010096573	
This is a lot of silliness about a woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon whom she barely knows. It's full of cliches, and the Liz Taylor character is not believable. It has a marvelous set, some exotic location footage. It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty. She looks stunning.	-1.4102391201913131	-1.1675344629333189	-0.9439867348427737	-0.8761312267524899	-0.6557286862123852	-0.4917746466696844	-0.43860932174311107	-0.0625434974135855	-0.05613312074932007	0.03157137569668263	0.035894416233414494	0.12064184966972707	0.15310062973371108	0.1545985987971976	0.21060804070154643	0.2351292820027472	0.31621820814567697	0.35768905408003104	0.6383877235028588	0.738898440608472	0.7888855573363325	0.8877110398954824	1.6588115483241896	1.704627007431311	1.8053635065294027	
Watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish. The story is always entertaining, the tension never loosing up. The whole cast is wonderful. The teaming of Walken and Bracco works to perfection, it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance. Bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence. For some reason they gave Walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut I can imagine  it's sort of a parody of the one Burt Lancaster had in Elmer Gantry. For me it added to the pleasure. It's the first movie I saw Miguel Ferrer in, probably one of the most under-appreciated movie actors of his generation. He's very good in a small role as Bracco's pimp. Even the Jamaican thugs are a sight to behold. I can highly recommend this movie.	-5.077889179436749	-4.105857224139171	-2.28373239218222	-1.9478278559064155	-1.7281138571693448	-0.47478811105447905	-0.05229296877421709	0.15714641461200296	0.36319873650315454	0.37665431056320486	0.4538295316080795	0.5695282454178651	0.5965713820184775	0.7177250737790557	0.8687507644224783	1.0443204958929213	1.31558183593848	1.3485664504573656	1.9882898613946864	2.122913110594128	2.277457136748136	2.9281542016118847	3.439553195552191	3.53462831952347	5.30854417010815	
This movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `Oh I want to learn more about Custer's life and his last stand', do not rent `They Died with Their Boots On'. But, if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film, with a little bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />The story starts out with Custer's (Errol Flynn) first day at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. The movie follows his career from West Point and his many battles, including his battle in the Civil War. The movie ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn. In between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland).<br /><br />Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant, but suave George Armstrong Custer well. Olivia De Havilland plays the cute, sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet. Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. The acting in general was impressive, especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. The director's portrayal of Custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn hate him.<br /><br />I give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film.	-5.095473751678561	-3.3710944822660522	-3.017159158084902	-2.3458207764091754	-1.152155293805251	-0.5117231006635673	-0.3700806692318385	-0.3249092926061618	-0.3017938795687545	-0.14710846226731727	0.012330170583125896	0.3856090018599696	0.8693273041739762	1.0495138943590652	1.1162929971909876	1.427006881854706	1.4481586757360243	1.5106475043645144	1.8490882909449418	1.872925835100866	1.9843113713237024	2.056171409490438	3.255295701806948	3.500957213224949	5.986710028604767

Reality before reality TV? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A precursor to "Say Anything" that's grittier? I can't decide, but the soundtrack *is* the 80's--Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie, AND U2--I can't believe this, they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today.<br /><br />I remembered this like a teenager--mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80's. Watching it again, I just can't describe how much I love that Rose, play by Kimberly Richardson, turns out to be the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90's, and she was almost 30 when she was in Last American Virgin, playing alongside 16 year-olds--fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy, and comedy--with a sincere cherry on top.	-4.081996131173988	-1.8564900189487386	-1.6171980496098775	-1.5316559780532488	-0.8589396781418459	-0.8524078211388487	-0.8386099634739129	-0.72767970062069	-0.7158227516991764	-0.7093368828194844	-0.49903764099788506	-0.32066813503549507	-0.17801123357840787	-0.0022641143730001007	0.09927785329252645	0.1086889507229288	0.12168350617410713	0.2843743459567885	0.3366062126445779	0.5279072418405193	0.634797631248917	0.6691819344744554	1.5725002575363898	1.9103815199171341	3.842121859792092	
This movie was a major bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a UFO movie. Well.......<br /><br />I think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend, or a friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of the UFO encounters. Cheesy! As the movie progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors. (There are a few exceptions).<br /><br />Rebecca was verrryyy disappointing. She is always found in the house and doesn't show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has return to the fold. Doesn't she ever leave the house? <br /><br />I had to turn off the movie several times in order to finish it. I hope that Rebecca doesn't believe the message of this movie - believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change OUT OF LOVE, NOT FEAR.	-3.6978347029035192	-3.2214620421636755	-2.3762374563235005	-1.6597639466819718	-0.9459992218639901	-0.5167454077752234	-0.5102067090252834	-0.3221895589854195	-0.31560701471635133	-0.15683109327979705	-0.11785124566914068	-0.0536494855409836	0.10438795258192693	0.33540142000987044	0.3366500710562809	0.3430259952210078	0.4946212573318174	0.49544711197676267	0.7073373903643314	0.7970632800573421	0.8467317454340579	1.1813466532783166	2.381337168711908	2.477862529782325	4.66781263933189	
Director Fabio Barreto got a strange Academy Nominea for his last movie O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto did one of the Worst movies of All Time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english? In the film they do. There isn't a Screenplay, It's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.	-2.464584674545521	-1.3553807652698002	-1.0141683495946618	-0.9604873735307871	-0.892710409155242	-0.7273760729295335	-0.6177470563530227	-0.500414778111094	-0.484954613564495	-0.433420840984378	-0.10257903555467411	-0.04459373760476422	0.008091924453295221	0.048075937347464265	0.05289632049132967	0.08784443915578416	0.10250873754785733	0.21087168532409906	0.25181024756189135	0.38178019563805066	0.5066059719853023	0.6396465309881102	0.8568932047160098	1.1035343677144542	2.2349134738140934	
This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed. While late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest film of the era I have seen regarding Nazi atrocities.<br /><br />The film begins in a courtroom in the future--after the war is over (the film was made in 1944--the war ended in May, 1945). In this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal Grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. At first, it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after a while, it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama.<br /><br />All in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second-tier actors. There are many compelling scenes and performances--especially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears. It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first. Overall, it's a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film.<br /><br />FYI--This is not meant as a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was referred to as "that paper hanger". This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper. This is in fact NOT true--previously he'd been a "starving artist", homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI. A horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!	-2.8889273441234464	-2.8603313103550656	-2.8127590821299475	-2.499113954414373	-1.657936744637236	-1.5696137153456386	-0.9800250492295137	-0.8407766761788364	-0.5744043571905718	-0.4670319484025651	-0.40851979376837566	0.08989396833496839	0.11821841969680752	0.2112896920853098	0.45597092612985285	0.47517001586552027	0.5249886335619535	0.7011433107377842	1.1962931925947728	1.2316784602655066	1.627372601886363	1.873743765454928	3.2902587726749153	3.914297513594715	6.199129679348618	
This review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based.<br /><br />The right to be presumed "Innocent until proven guilty" is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society; but according to Fred Schepisi's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous Australian murder trial, it was not granted to Lindy Chamberlain, accused of killing her baby. The story suggesting her innocence was unlikely (a dingo was alleged to have taken it), but those implying her guilt even more so, and there was no solid evidence against her. But the Australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt, and the deeply religious Chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media (and the media themselves, of course, were anything but innocent in this process). So although cleared by an initial inquest, they were later prosecuted and convicted. Although Chamberlain was eventually released, this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence "proving" their innocence, something no defendants should have to produce.<br /><br />'A Cry in the Dark' is well acted throughout, especially by Meryl Streep, who puts on a convincing Australian accent (at least to this Pom's ears) and manages keep Lindy sympathetic (to us) while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure. The scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking, because we believe in the characters as real. <br /><br />Regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story (something I can't comment on), the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the British popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership's least charitable instincts. No legal system will ever be perfect; but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary British tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put Lindy Chamberlain away. I'm not a religious man, but the Bible still contains some killer lines (if you'll excuse the pun). "Judge not lest ye be judged" is one of them.	-5.68909505915267	-2.7828322136344963	-2.375835045332203	-2.2430260076472988	-2.03754108871155	-1.7034787182760247	-1.235239289541772	-0.554713300262105	-0.4425844167697773	-0.30020979382768254	-0.13056028797647362	-0.0760525797174558	0.20841291008499788	0.21176459127374536	0.3178885708710347	0.3721731035738777	0.42518637296672906	0.5721541204893689	0.6995578621513039	0.8678837248931259	0.9156536881712142	0.9387266474606085	1.9673878986510664	3.0876144397750758	6.12836700567474	
I first saw Thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the Jinn I guess. As any kid would be, I was delighted with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. Several years later, I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script I had missed on that first viewing. I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years. In addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller at his very best. When you see Thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time. When you see Thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece. It`s as timeless as the story it treats. An amazing work.<br /><br />Thomas McCarthy	-3.2466075218346817	-2.9580498159126734	-1.739654129869249	-1.47762783421304	-1.0129197578011508	-0.5916935382799956	-0.31732875453518433	-0.26201865793369633	0.017906330581144145	0.3224897788082204	0.38957142470817707	0.43501880987741376	0.4844587577757107	0.5050353740081764	0.5341172075935922	0.5801914032984458	0.5832703960791379	0.613186986736582	0.8517859636615344	1.2626658444478842	1.3875615548201372	1.5132882039833717	3.047424088845604	3.7003484383629712	4.247169182677152	
Postwar England, the dawn of the "atomic age". Yet, the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first "kiss" cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as THE BOMB. This was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the<br /><br />1940's. Free of political correctness and preachy messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (and<br /><br />hormones) of a young teenager can create. Wonderful subplots<br /><br />maintain character interest ala "Gregory's Girl", and plenty<br /><br />of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has<br /><br />ever been in love, or ever wanted to be. Does he ever get his wish? Watch it and see.	-2.030163502989121	-1.598112667335386	-1.0690506939312538	-0.5236492729206699	-0.5218026054603826	-0.3668790349107178	-0.22944968163659812	-0.10755070882853057	-0.07006295873500945	0.23106213516089896	0.23407935231541915	0.29865813802120456	0.3452668050978539	0.43826294379071296	0.48303806973336594	0.5300369710243152	0.5792599621867931	0.5866103065513839	0.600149423115452	0.6253224890782989	0.635471045225471	1.0537278029408785	1.251704247364371	1.3454471374609789	1.970794162183938	
Now this is more like it!One of the best movies I have ever seen!Despite it made very well on all aspects,this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate.Loosen up!There are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand,how entertaining and how captivating this movie was!Now this is what a movie ticket is all about!You will get exacty what you want from this movie's genre and all naysayers are those with the anti-Flynn syndrome.This conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti-Elvis,anti-Ali,anti-Clinton,anti-Kennedy syndromes,usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs.If the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art,you will find this movie not only one of the best classics,but also one of the best movies of all time.I rate it the second best western ever, right behind Wayne's The Cowboys........	-0.44434486860267824	-0.3581175025128388	-0.22277212856568482	-0.21844150901056406	-0.2123219445255653	-0.1696761933901206	-0.06775318139889668	-0.04890563077006934	-0.03768627276949277	-0.03385355231757161	0.003445688785449395	0.0056375206544212585	0.05611445792532066	0.09321165124464031	0.1067045505335285	0.12648141836383134	0.14045653360393878	0.20993159544770632	0.2157445843678649	0.22133018201048038	0.2735599706256718	0.2805061507764514	0.35158829644267453	0.4220294011732784	0.4431012674122452	
This would have worked a lot better if it had been made as "Mitchell in Malta." At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit...not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger. Mitchell being Mitchell, the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either. Oh well. At least the comic comments of Mike and the Bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of MST. I can't imagine watching it on it's own, however.	-2.126868922350472	-1.3865182529608493	-0.8627750588197269	-0.7687843312313903	-0.6621532735686073	-0.19804782756334416	-0.1573817210518007	-0.11644985940073534	-0.09457156520774093	-0.023500761506365528	-0.019518355169076768	0.017343788000586252	0.04760417059934901	0.04862648220720719	0.07271031556836319	0.22167369042035326	0.23650923881582842	0.2461628146357332	0.38155919347966116	0.40147748865000715	0.5829594642467538	0.7391649839803703	0.9714964305675212	1.2898074436418736	2.239312720800682	
i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good, right? how wrong i was. <br /><br />i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah)... well the director/writer of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man, because i cannot see how he (along with the other actors in the film) would ever agree to be in this disaster. <br /><br />this movie is absolutely appalling! it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. <br /><br />some examples of just bad silly moments in Edison... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird... 3 guys being shot in the head...<br /><br />this movie is the opposite of good.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM EDISON!	-4.331717826710957	-2.848318927878091	-2.8431546601422073	-2.320843531672712	-2.2851754107834874	-0.8685591109296759	-0.8506965973100636	-0.775747785898806	-0.6302644188566195	-0.5960876319380574	-0.3599341549315742	-0.2508027443275369	-0.07632188469132757	0.16685956113127962	0.24527950033256407	0.5294664095049704	0.7306190722239391	1.0271668003313332	1.0440976558971944	1.1878420675054726	1.337434892461082	1.5099693924566564	1.6103674224897215	3.6850856984868225	6.0927049997204765	
When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors. It was one of many movies I watched with my parents, but this was the only one we walked out of. Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently, and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it. What a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career. In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, non-love, halitosis, whatever. The film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos. This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a "more pronounced depth of meaning and truth". But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman. The film is painfully slow and dull. But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters. Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity. Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room. Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes. Everyone is "lost" and "struggling", desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them. It's never about resolution, it's only about interminable introspective babble. It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect. Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out. And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining. I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance. I highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death. Otherwise, let's just pretend this film never happened.	-12.02871220521649	-5.470354465966797	-5.014756533335722	-4.944599722003685	-4.933258528761987	-4.921869450459846	-4.634525329895941	-0.8303552693618913	-0.7072968266320283	-0.7014762332740868	-0.3926461215412687	-0.391287749834372	0.10434761049908356	0.3152109269935249	0.515148580087969	0.7304651344686718	0.942270853203147	1.2718256421988743	1.6379116083971574	1.7626094633179978	1.7906410440269989	2.183731878603452	4.9483981464757125	7.372900090028291	14.1529921092617	
Absolutely awful movie. Utter waste of time.<br /><br />background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech. Well if you really listen closely, whatever they speak is actually unintelligible.<br /><br />Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives a headache, action is shoddy, dialogs are unintelligible, Acting is abysmal and well Kareena used to look like a wrestler, now she looks like a starved wrestler. Hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace.<br /><br />After spending three hours watching a movie I want to like it, but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure. <br /><br />Please if you want to torture yourself, go ahead watch this.	-4.616757132718202	-2.6347836323098153	-2.5525526201818085	-2.53579237898887	-2.3834344850266884	-1.068482085606758	-0.8456801566535942	-0.8308572213732905	-0.8055679849724707	-0.7918458651181652	-0.5637920733525746	-0.38560421177354803	-0.14968349601456482	0.04135264426183176	0.12769721834449987	0.5152578196358147	0.7311512403824163	0.8335106581962733	0.9903535389399428	1.0957151040765456	1.2708815062116645	1.367367365223655	1.4436061526842974	2.6756883490369123	4.586105253197118	
i see there are great reviews of this film already, i've got a few points to comment on, reasons i thought there was something special about this film...<br /><br />first and foremost, the film is realistic. it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager, but that's really the kind of superdrama that goes on amongst teens all the time. second, the good guy, the guy who treats women with respect, doesn't get the girls. that's the way it is, in real life just the same! he's too nice for his own good. people are just selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self-confidence. i mean, that role already takes confidence from the actor, i'm not just talking about the character. overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky, partyin' teen sex comedies at the rental shelf. don't get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's a good laugh as well.	-2.3935344452051255	-2.0768733065293645	-1.4033345707134557	-0.7809856846150045	-0.59017922244405	-0.4064476212886867	-0.2820624678634232	-0.10546606766807101	0.004879624832361067	0.010330598797755886	0.02234899941917029	0.035277686899521876	0.12938471034611912	0.28977954167983516	0.34360556548168786	0.4602664700370125	0.4789410484563525	0.5238955353422434	0.6228273796892179	0.7526658976224833	0.9411869716854023	1.1874006149109102	1.8849549340251188	2.401796548916448	2.7582932627876553

This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and I'm still wondering what the heck Bill Paxton was doing in this film? And why the heck does he always play the exact same character? From Aliens onward, every film I've seen with Bill Paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...<br /><br />Overall, this is second-rate action trash. There are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch Judgement Night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.	-4.243229881772611	-2.618514008787723	-2.57685408857475	-2.3343977009233257	-2.284956984797722	-0.9488988699296144	-0.9100906114783116	-0.867233067482158	-0.6018734062148535	-0.39077678627547774	-0.3234424563764061	-0.321998112201265	-0.255439090398329	-0.13082255774303292	-0.11365125686702851	0.04626898820970835	0.04833156812949186	0.1372394443791745	0.7861075678428895	0.8819993672487266	0.9456566810111569	1.4317599875668336	1.4775469796559468	3.0990648266218943	4.696669406627091	
Another Asian horror movie packed with intense, and creepy moments. Another Asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot, which is here as well. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!<br /><br />The movie starts pretty simple - two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself. The sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the elder one - and they seem to ignore their father. All goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father. Then it hits you, "your sister has been dead for years now" It turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn't know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well.As for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sister's alter ego) is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in! I hope it has been made clearer for confused Asian horror fans out there.<br /><br />Finally - my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack. Very creepy! 7 out of 10	-1.8982258174884663	-1.7535686669092836	-1.247032218230578	-1.1788491168862216	-1.0676064044164169	-0.4729122592906849	-0.42847226909902925	-0.3585999245179659	-0.29377450890871426	-0.2204800814104951	-0.1696183963240486	-0.16379282627646857	-0.01543539997103327	-0.007993252382451715	0.00884127071098438	0.12178139834483208	0.16001691236616103	0.17584980411488021	0.7355872720517689	0.9725604779808971	1.0982540928397442	1.1575503759227135	1.1716048967962038	2.004353406145252	2.8912417171387617	
I am currently 22 years old, and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out. You heard me right, I was 5 years old, and yet I can still distinctly remember what I saw that afternoon so many years ago. Was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of Mark Twain's creativity?... No, on the other hand, it was a quite creepy film about Mark Twain's dark, depressed, and in fact suicidal side. One scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain is playing the organ at his own funeral.<br /><br />Would an adult enjoy this film? Well, this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of Mark Twain's writing might enjoy; but trust me on this, "Adventures" is NOT the film you want to use to introduce your young children to Mark Twain.	-2.234240527401791	-1.2891737079225178	-1.1677610382823658	-0.7725569300600293	-0.7555008218321869	-0.7434576364376069	-0.6505589201277001	-0.2903295790563435	-0.03606607246923914	-0.002961906875256392	0.009085008222322583	0.05110999783233798	0.08860698841700404	0.09210269155092952	0.09379126645865747	0.1569104521062114	0.22535013939998624	0.266899536328179	0.2990904924021455	0.5796949430837232	0.6267232043978274	0.7636422225006391	0.7699311578586913	1.541168700430648	3.1389883659996234	
The tenuous connection between this film and the first Grease is established right at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young Maxwell Caulfield who is a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton St. John's foreign speech pattern is not explained, it's explained here Caulfield is her cousin. What's Conn still doing in school, I guess she just likes hanging around Rydell High even though now she's a beautician.<br /><br />Caulfield's a smart kid, so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed have him labeled as a nerd. And that's especially bad when Zmed's girl friend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd just isn't going to cut it.<br /><br />That's when Caulfield decides to put on a modern day Zorro act. He gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride. He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face. If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted.<br /><br />Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed. If you saw the first Grease film, a much better film, than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out.<br /><br />In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Dody Goodman, all faculty members from the original Grease return in their roles. The music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original.<br /><br />It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not all that great.	-4.975085670524303	-2.767551654148379	-2.6681673813184803	-2.284380463225935	-2.187205488521635	-1.4524735866700895	-1.4139146863757217	-0.7019666467825953	-0.41793341695690045	-0.16812520544420695	-0.13959358524837917	0.0762288715692834	0.34078644236688876	0.3487772354098223	0.35646732591773517	0.4393636097420035	0.5611253493361781	0.5822002400532031	0.7844158500660303	0.9775685681755683	1.1958281180384933	1.451485253034311	2.2859209498448605	3.599561100420318	6.755370159295452	
Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining AND memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") misadventures into the world of first-time sex and true love. Along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow hopeless romantic Gary (The main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it's ending. If you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look...sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. L.A.V. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it's genre.	-2.207768414318477	-1.2063519384282237	-1.066056003433696	-0.842607497751225	-0.7669293278355287	-0.45863897105939827	-0.41254370128388285	-0.3813101405795508	-0.11694117205103713	0.12114614927935409	0.2029968633939287	0.24682433978035045	0.27195152193758065	0.4163006468076252	0.5078694456654109	0.6055897251451167	0.7156999485449478	0.7628881992332841	0.7999771499181085	0.8326141095886618	1.2803933107615462	1.306039577425078	1.4310495466141986	1.5332675456782485	2.164165638536508	
This is an extremely-powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be infuriating to watch. I say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people, in this case an innocent Australian couple charged with killing their baby.<br /><br />Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned it so well I had trouble understanding her in parts.)<br /><br />Without giving anything away, all I can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally.	-1.4268085378758064	-1.112925151175069	-1.054922975947846	-0.828189704694805	-0.597884180490252	-0.5311346083134443	-0.233912155060936	-0.21773379315441846	-0.17682016619234597	-0.07551770949885293	-0.02104009260837722	0.004850676499683321	0.02761262337741166	0.06348101270631692	0.1141015590500711	0.14846143293441544	0.3266210568537079	0.39308503683219287	0.4222275680954792	0.47324021165880786	0.5417980558347761	0.5832692989210809	1.0120040256126608	1.4528742344555352	2.565724243148456	
The movie is truly poignant, unique and uplifting. The story is universal in that it's a battle between good, evil and the world between. THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading, and a travesty. Blockbuster has it rated as though it were an X rated movie. The truth is is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub-titles.	-1.7931892182312135	-1.6549374106543469	-1.226363462197638	-1.2039133266790323	-0.8604106446658214	-0.413356224768303	-0.3682688659793002	-0.03631770504554148	0.06990222964243477	0.15244776332145837	0.17547358026669851	0.20570403296509793	0.30846364540667415	0.44494530113017355	0.4759658245562366	0.5788006612810872	0.6734699699315115	0.6942791421047755	0.7661105722354868	0.8402733459337912	0.8494182455600828	1.03506349248386	1.4968490197144262	1.5884362674956471	2.0038864030348047	
This movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of Alan Ladd. This is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say, but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that tough-guy Ladd is going to hoop through his usual paces, is going to be mighty disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly introduced in the third reel. True, his role is a key one but it's small and likely to get lost in the shuffle. There are many key roles in former newspaperman Martin Mooney's ambivalent screenplay which hits out at all political alliances and quite ruthlessly denigrates Reform candidates. It's the lovely and extremely talented Joan Woodbury who ties the various strands of the wide-ranging story together. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps, much like the films later turned out by the French "New Wave", though easier to follow here, especially if you are aware that the film's original title was Paper Bullets. Nonetheless, some of the film's narrative and character switches are a little disconcerting, particularly in the role played by Jack LaRue who has wisely elected to act the part in a strangely non-committal way. One of Jack's best acting jobs ever, but no-one is likely to notice, alas!	-2.636235728969438	-2.270045861352791	-2.2165934474912703	-1.699293891963007	-1.2494452169620862	-0.8469392861831021	-0.7918205355768593	-0.5636264270667066	-0.24715448215992014	-0.20367475054792455	-0.09639273479169458	0.21102046970142888	0.37690611495080495	0.42627021766349954	0.4425874312280741	0.4982564437862726	0.5411605300100613	0.5962632872950222	0.6968406161837735	0.7057892326121185	0.9060408912490152	1.003657867670157	2.235707997814839	2.7900068136608387	4.509357708754936	
The DVD for this film is by Alpha Video--a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints. In Alpha's defense, often that is the only print available, but the specialize in public domain and cheap-o films. If you can find another print by a different company, try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded. Still, compared to most Alpha DVDs, this one is excellent--especially since the sound is pretty clear (and Alpha never seems to include closed captionings--even with films with horrid sound).<br /><br />A man has been dating a lady for a very long time. One night, he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon afterwords, he comes clean to his fiancée about this, she forgives him and they marry.<br /><br />Very soon after the wedding, he gets a frantic call from the other woman--she NEEDS to see him and has just tried to kill herself. When they meet, he learns that she has an STD and she wanted him to know that he, too, might now have it. Then, although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! The makes a HUGE mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife. Some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! At this point, the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people (actually, these were just films of people with STDs that they spliced into the film--most of whom have syphilis).<br /><br />In some ways the film is very progressive. It addresses a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples NOT to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urges--but only with each other (not bad advice at all). On the other hand, the film never exactly says what it's talking about. They never use the terms STD, VD or the like, nor does it even name the diseases. Often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it's talking about herpes or other STDs--the information just isn't very clear or specific--a VERY common problem with such films from this era. Audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their 'faster' friends explain it all to them! <br /><br />Speaking of "such films", in the 1930s-50s, lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex (though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in Hollywood films). Many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over-done and the information so inaccurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both by the same two-bit production company) and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are, this cheap film seems like it should be in the Criterion Collection!! <br /><br />Interestingly, there are weirdos out there (I would definitely be included among them) that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun. This one, however, isn't THAT bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films. While the message really should have been more explicit and useful, for a 1933 film it's pretty good--despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene. Remember kids--just say 'NO' to suicide!<br /><br />Oh, by the way, the "two years of treatment" they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. Nowadays, it's a lot more treatable--as are the rest of the STDs.	-12.411908478010607	-5.698583297315187	-4.8778922525811605	-4.223682960466907	-4.0277075213770495	-3.8741275653475715	-3.572526191100937	-1.7508785937173932	-1.2413377541119104	-0.7305600742018109	-0.5136728186337963	0.30859961301987143	0.38902210130636633	0.5755338149692146	0.743851392810781	0.8107182867862734	1.2143013842199601	1.5404595632587559	1.7489369517995135	1.8277627277959945	2.002959501316855	2.6655884871687943	4.512250368489352	6.739099626015261	13.820222723714641	
Madonna gets into action, again and she fails again! Who's That Girl was released just one year after the huge flop of Shangai Surprise and two after the successful cult movie Desperately seeking Susan. She chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie, not suspecting that this latter could be a flop, too. The movie received a bad acceptance by American critic and audience, while in Europe it was a success. Madonna states that "Some people don't want that she's successful both as a pop star and a movie-star". The soundtrack album, in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title-track single was agreat hit all over the world, as like as the World Tour. The truth isthat Madonna failed as an actress 'cause the script was quite weak. Butit's not so bad, especially for those who like the 80's: it's such a ramshackle, trash, colorful and joyful action movie ! At the end, it's very funny to watch it.	-3.495582249544281	-2.264573721955426	-2.2027051891135767	-1.6616388794365426	-1.1952167913021055	-1.0686641154771621	-0.766361805431781	-0.41217079604579154	-0.3370301751632174	-0.2909363788995981	-0.27687794469164595	-0.09265617266231288	0.07185729298584631	0.18349786302030513	0.28463306005958106	0.3033849004300683	0.34467999832922835	0.6489547127419344	0.8933932131853773	0.9353524155295277	1.0397669889869037	1.2001118685744727	1.4586361915300956	3.171135812315988	5.085315065379262	
Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life. Abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go with this plot and, because of bad acting, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve, although it is difficult to speak of any characters... perhaps except for Sonny. Beside him, actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to, they come off as self-indulging amateurs. I wonder what ruined the movie more: the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or the bad acting, disturbing any appeal that might be left.	-2.77093203307395	-1.9715663805638788	-1.5117875354466865	-1.2974047990624853	-1.1582249204250723	-0.9417323510079618	-0.8688564761537076	-0.6677908718659331	-0.3054330055831932	-0.29728709966605116	-0.2224333041601535	-0.21687135464290677	-0.17788533247870103	-0.1377391390139417	0.14085188299757925	0.150796426875343	0.4564730198628653	0.5409124132531509	0.5623450165364029	0.6730578321600711	0.8891401997730289	1.1321990863828848	1.2653502036797126	1.802507462780805	4.347122462368411	
The anime that got me hooked on anime...<br /><br />Set in the year 2010 (hey, that's not too far away now!) the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! Oh the insanity!<br /><br />The "heroes" of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki, a red haired Japanese woman (yeah I know, they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond, blue eyed nice guy Al. Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain (also known as "Brenten"), a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper. Britain didn't like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare "where the boys are more your size" as he puts it. There's also Specs, the bifocal genius, Bible quoting/God fearing Chaplain, purple MO-hawked Mohican, and the pot bellied Chief, who's right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics. Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they're not very well liked by the people.<br /><br />The "villains" are a cyborg named Buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as "Green Peace", his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma. In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku. The story, however, was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic ("Manga") book that's very hard to find.<br /><br />All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you'd better go get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police".	-5.975557160332342	-3.321487558459468	-2.919220918914128	-2.2781870856450372	-2.072358070993488	-1.2751508653125736	-0.947251262094174	-0.4718888331497506	-0.41776226483287626	-0.41729861348856795	-0.2928942437569604	-0.07752838190547916	-0.03970484404814138	0.14699101451039637	0.19171028734552018	0.7873512156490651	0.8285329092323169	0.9316631625828047	1.101513258170944	1.1139946295586132	1.2051230426121995	1.3500835718619868	1.4906404133763	3.50955336478982	6.895508232833751	
I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6,7, well... not so bad. Genre: scifi...good I like scifi. So I got the movie and I was looking forward to have a relaxing Sunday evening watching it. But but...NO.<br /><br />As in summary, this isn't a movie at all. It is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about Jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. Movie starts with a epic abduction story: Driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... Well, actually that was the film. Last of this ..ummm... frankly I don't know what to call it...was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement. Quite a same stuff what these TV-preachers tell you, but they are "good" at it.<br /><br />Honestly, if you wan't to see a scifi movie or something with UFOs, please stay far away from this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear some cuckoo head's opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do. Then go ahead and watch this "thing", but I still prefer going to the church at Sunday.<br /><br />This is complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as another users said= Well... I should have red another users comments before I got the movie. <br /><br />(27% of voters have rated this "thing" as 10. Yeah, right. Please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda)	-4.533614193329583	-3.6852280066671947	-3.0503226820612133	-2.9706364248344856	-1.8065318133709514	-1.0378860669103507	-1.004398816023641	-0.987242450800665	-0.5233676289537911	-0.43545098247787895	-0.39335079186225086	-0.37376581174616147	-0.16307487468062862	0.10084689267639131	0.23277074508956452	0.33635342173322447	0.44321542344418746	1.072463254245414	1.282004892112304	1.430925302105476	1.4972012999491697	1.5118022743910768	2.4914800048338934	3.496003238309413	5.827133798054595	
It's hard and I didn't expect it... But it's really the worst film, me and my wife saw. Awful dialogs that extend incomprehensibly through time without any apparent reason except to fill time. The storytelling doesn't follow a comprehensive intelligibly way everything is a mess. The action and the dialogs appear at jumps. The thing that disappointed me most was to see Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this uh I don't even know how to describe it without being polite The rest of the actors where at the most poor. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character, making a flat inexpressive performance. Poor special effects. I don't think that it was a complete waste of film but it's close to If I'm to say I would advise everyone not to see this movie. I think it would be a complete waste of time. Sincerely I never though I would say something like that about a movie but there's always a first time.	-6.009135632407247	-3.447549318253321	-3.3620077512414417	-3.2500305381884296	-2.9073297390335053	-1.4351222615143011	-1.2434937809676345	-0.9307886390110818	-0.8792331140598484	-0.8100681471795572	-0.7211478326053534	-0.6577302481048977	-0.3298793740248154	-0.255462064252855	-0.1647698041994941	-0.06719183411168998	0.20616445685897847	0.48228686383643454	0.969513673299091	1.213797229138294	1.4595402859585918	1.62217377072699	1.9572992662917394	3.4554263298204853	5.9843881285154605	
Gilles Mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before to get engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's haircut. Oherwise it can get very confusing... Still a strong film debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the 5th element, the Messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a darling to watch ... I felt a little disappointed near the end so I gave it 9 out of 10.	-0.5313130014820544	-0.47274862104759824	-0.3909780254522109	-0.3844437817615603	-0.3282747930813342	-0.248985593885437	-0.23262057050596358	-0.171625456063765	-0.15219084321450974	-0.10147663527489549	-0.049879210680395275	-0.040748237133872725	-7.144045886595465E-4	0.007653657521674573	0.009942673481100617	0.06545660454190379	0.07861042452291007	0.08250043761764346	0.13059364483477479	0.2757810561557285	0.289415905620389	0.42776749910544076	0.546316409402354	0.6097621809086209	0.962645775055246	
This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but don't be mislead, it's not at all. There are barely any weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weed in this movie. The marijuana field is merely a plot device.<br /><br />My impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of (their idea of) witty dialog and make a movie. The product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting, to say this movie has no 'hook' is a huge understatement. Don't waste your time or money.	-3.763815612484764	-2.009570529555835	-1.8982285194649082	-1.7377013433677644	-1.512627777410776	-1.1804424698995926	-1.04929029353215	-0.5288227010419779	-0.3289131821308579	-0.28982298657102884	-0.19912919137269713	-0.17196613031650712	-0.015948631593137492	-0.0033949035272598793	0.03278828159697497	0.07063139616544312	0.07689511135290003	0.2020766105083369	0.4062284025368386	0.5603251831034797	0.7663718411474842	0.8127476195018325	1.5191106956132114	2.022900471236725	3.7900201706739987	
Featuring some amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, superbly designed and executed sets, Nightbreed is a great film.<br /><br />Sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity.<br /><br />Perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries.<br /><br />None the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie/superhero genre.<br /><br />A sequel featuring Highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting. <br /><br />Another idea would be the foundation of the new Midian. Perhaps in Texas somewhere or the swamps of Lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus.	-1.6502562217565013	-1.527295940954497	-0.7563210293568883	-0.7215966205596911	-0.5662248944234579	-0.5284229784048404	-0.2983659050941748	-0.27739460741836486	-0.23924154849363147	-0.09025670077327087	-0.01626662929375039	0.036856685191029526	0.15540826703905172	0.20023306260690732	0.29307749022086205	0.30422714395886896	0.3415702443380284	0.4797694017517096	0.520274125158551	0.5765090985756138	0.6775102612192012	0.7429564679643611	0.8315646938604268	1.2968143048441094	2.353713352011642	
I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. Sure it is a bit slow moving in parts, but what else would one expect from Rollin? Also there is plenty of nudity, nothing wrong with that, particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous, Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead, bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. There is also a sci-fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but I wouldn't bother too much with that. No, here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still 'alive' without memory. My DVD sleeve mentions David Cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films, there is some similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space. As I have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations, including a stunning railway setting at the end.	-2.1443074986491166	-1.4269729371297837	-1.4006137125609013	-0.8816065119189905	-0.6253833595961977	-0.34145900745933455	-0.24157134413338452	-0.20788316384997646	-0.18837288010030095	-0.17498184549194623	-0.1683250254212248	-0.16778686578304763	-0.16687862139117413	0.08660155241392374	0.21250764066174577	0.2741559276523485	0.3877145544602696	0.5691149365061965	0.7389331047841686	0.9156731540717993	0.9707421755672094	1.1468981950455417	1.801095475348714	1.9102800524659311	2.360384715301784	
I was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here? What was up with the pumpkins? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.<br /><br />I am truly amazed. I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.	-3.732268904788303	-1.6623900725812975	-1.4755144371631481	-1.3761514997382331	-1.2219357660037145	-0.8717276034286412	-0.7702535766912287	-0.5439657587163251	-0.5162636578942631	-0.41031963250091424	-0.17980889160069716	-0.16045772355105611	0.02511221065849499	0.030219610117092288	0.19455291879420364	0.21741875490211643	0.26525338439641377	0.3079567935920998	0.4729514235035936	0.7181374453668752	0.7317905024378848	0.8107475302671555	1.3880610772430964	1.899409468926454	3.9974491308641187	
This movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the North americian falangist party - or some similar group... The strong man (Kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash. The only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the KKK was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy... Try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you'll see what I mean...<br /><br />It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page actually made music for this movie... :(	-1.4164532451384981	-0.851485199794151	-0.8482205869031165	-0.6538993911240631	-0.633047701647151	-0.3422425511228234	-0.33281075656549153	-0.3219502733123838	-0.3028608420246406	-0.2593248799840418	-0.23142485885258723	-0.2211403109963978	-0.11875226332629704	-0.061394493572590206	0.0050207555126276365	0.04828358926089213	0.18611444861589127	0.23021633113004733	0.2679839863302438	0.3065548088430823	0.37706175437187217	0.4474678718932623	0.507676220590531	0.7596583877525928	1.3677437485045636	
Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt, in his heart, was the right thing to do. The viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done. The adversity that coach Jones and Radio both faced was both tragic and predictable. People did not understand; nor did they want to understand. But in the end, the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened. Radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little, besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature: Intuition, compassion, and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how. It was sad the way coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that terrified the life out of Radio was enough to make you want to severely punish, not only the boys involved, but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it. However, on the positive side of the scale, the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies. This movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed. Ed Harris was his usual brilliance. Gooding was flawless. Radio is an inspiration.	-2.452887206489154	-2.1807120195527765	-1.6564547094622346	-1.449718446843243	-0.6681906909109199	-0.4609168446752534	-0.4058050678256018	-0.39151466213151787	-0.2786523116196207	-0.16863597798803381	0.013744858034702975	0.07258310562655511	0.07957226950861367	0.08417753108185433	0.11073668856110475	0.3791765782338014	0.46572902189582943	0.49266834480785077	0.4950131953755387	0.6711482065267598	0.9452586565224256	1.359960662408325	1.7676894982791311	2.198602625720448	4.118656289229642	
How awful is it? Let me count the ways: 1) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a UFO investigation, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? It annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, I'd run like Hell in the opposite direction. They're scary! 3) The acting is terrible. They all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) The cinematography is home-movie bad. Wait, actually its not even that good. 5) Script bad, bad, bad. All dialogue, no action. Like a tennis match, they bounce back and forth between the "talking head" close ups. 6) Direction... what direction? Oh, there must have been a director there somewhere. I challenge you to figure out where.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I have some positive comments about this movie. The editing seemed professional, but couldn't make a difference. A good edit of bad material is still a bad movie. The opening theme music was actually very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad the movie wasn't about UFOs.<br /><br />If you can't tell already, here's the bottom line. I wasted my money seeing this movie, and it made me angry. If they had not disguised what this movie was really about, I could say it was my fault.	-10.943877867729153	-5.864670751296632	-4.840889358611285	-4.575838953232006	-4.344533529234632	-3.215382738835793	-2.7357911654622837	-1.3238461405864768	-1.08879103471093	-0.7797577868318015	-0.769631635109975	-0.7540271341099382	-0.27843053075545476	0.5505155224551561	0.6613297813200971	0.9829983838230417	1.0753145868076277	1.4615095627834886	1.5150159495689077	1.7033472185628276	2.0420006835924176	2.1269395472552732	3.0185563283599537	6.594447985740725	12.384275260569039	
I am not understanding why people are praising this movie. I didn't like it at all. I watch it with several people. None of them cared for it either. First of all. It is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. The actual filming looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When you watch the movie along with the DVD extras. You will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent. There are facts that do appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it. I have read several books and have watched several shows on this story. What I have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish someone could really do a good film on this one. It has always fascinated me. The bad acting really ruined the story. The little boys situation really hammed it up even more. When you watch this movie. The little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about. It didn't make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him. It was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was OK to throw baby brother to her. It is a whopping tale with him and his little problem. I can't still get over the little girl saying "Mom said tobacco will rot your teeth." Frank Fox's statement and facial expression is so bad. The scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to. The sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho. Also, The girl hovering over the bed and her little "Bladder control problem" are from The Exorcist. This movie is lacking from the talent of creativity. We put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a bummer. I also noticed that their was defects in the film quality. Parts of it looked like what a person might film on a Home video camera. I noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs. This is probably how this movie was put together. Someone said I like this story. I will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer. Doesn't matter if we don't know how to act. As long as we get it on film and say it is good. We got the family together and prepared food. Then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.	-11.740688911824831	-10.139261154681629	-7.42155788206676	-6.209163017681496	-3.9654946742246415	-3.1798963400210227	-2.6877786086359956	-1.3874514816711068	-0.6200726603986503	-0.5774243307719681	-0.4571647187585965	-0.05247084221436625	-0.027435120937788174	0.2649207108754686	0.5985357725172987	0.8756477698338668	0.9430033553000926	1.214560294110747	2.091748194021191	2.347683394767569	3.1535887215098675	3.183026517734031	6.521646200067711	8.413087702109504	15.017387118556371	
Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. Commercials try to show how unique and "funny" a show can be. Yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, I've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing, either.<br /><br />I don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness, cuteness or humor. The characters were insufferable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair's (which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this). The few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite.<br /><br />Rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all. And this is not one of them. Kath and Kim has exactly ONE redeeming quality - and that's Selma Blair. Despite wearing repugnant outfits and acting like a pitiful, whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still nice to look at.<br /><br />But if you want to look at Selma, go rent Hellboy. You'll at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of searing this abominable character into your brain to associate with her.<br /><br />All in all, Kath and Kim is a waste and truly epitomizes the worst that TV is or ever has been. It sets a new low.	-6.790502772979853	-3.578699195246787	-3.173870891514476	-3.139124225625513	-2.4839224569791103	-2.3133976227506623	-2.1131076049926727	-0.7175818669593	-0.31934245944900846	-0.18382812726059425	-0.10266996088683845	0.11598495383280112	0.129699412936797	0.17568007322156004	0.42566119964191507	0.49314979216500077	0.6276500063844415	0.7879746941669642	0.964676225460504	1.2910209804645516	1.3930522659024587	1.8339420268328397	1.8835966019429096	3.9656340274406885	8.080786905329404	
I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious movies, especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between his VERY funny side, and his serious side. He is of course VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease. he is truely a multi-function actor.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston's acting. I think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass. Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene.<br /><br />Overall, I would have to rate this a 9. Good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good film.	-4.015496096046511	-2.9504279201129515	-1.7785475914891051	-1.110434959698817	-0.8934429114623703	-0.4076310953985871	-0.309661580155303	-0.07547429382978636	0.034928415647733885	0.2888920098215591	0.3553112501500964	0.48647441538417685	0.6670076387164214	0.7935280236892839	0.9382920544893125	0.9439805528611573	0.961828062712675	1.0069698942352245	1.090389003975103	1.336873274269337	1.459904140715672	1.6999387375562285	2.3316491302475395	2.3959896231976683	4.312523389843116	
It's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. WITH SIX YOU GET EGG ROLL is directed by Howard Morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a TV show.<br /><br />DORIS DAY decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why. Even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help. BRIAN KEITH, BARBARA HERSHEY, PAT CARROLL and ALICE GHOSTLEY do their best, but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen.<br /><br />Nothing much can be said in favor of it. Skip it and see Miss Day in any number of her more worthwhile films.	-2.1542896939194134	-1.5360962478949245	-1.2642085088570336	-1.113986419347684	-0.8055930460660119	-0.5139748635088303	-0.4458090063953808	-0.2969649544913218	-0.2945060678463296	-0.2238678442379662	-0.21898354453400334	-0.17745380764506852	-0.13021926286509028	-0.058762365422857316	0.06151380262807023	0.06485633990331682	0.09317205716513921	0.47680751054485315	0.5588291622308392	0.6869244268563927	0.7465441436073775	0.849510218240823	1.0325816685151976	1.4712184226720522	2.5011433431638306	
...instead, watch it as a great coming of age tale about African American males in the mid 1960's in the ghettos of Chicago. For all of you out there under the age of 50, "What's Happening" was a light-hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) concerning a group of young African American high school kids living in a working class neighborhood. I liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. "Cooley High" started out as being the basis for "What's Happening", but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences, so it was redone as a comedy, even though the credits on "What's Happening" still read that it was based on this movie.<br /><br />This film starts out light, but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960's and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. The guys deal with sex, betrayal, joblessness, hopelessness, and even early death. The ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either.	-2.299476145425868	-1.932862263180987	-1.6077447646608596	-1.2561770988218492	-1.0013847761135026	-0.9054187165551486	-0.21416486219157574	-0.1489934963441893	-0.028478801960472422	0.10641477032079055	0.16415664249822925	0.17807120309583288	0.21293696817077867	0.2535098428010839	0.4089677927419528	0.4486096017984532	0.47594752512042876	0.7963273341587832	1.1212498754409255	1.1892474868840455	1.7364669801072077	1.9376675038789484	2.6213622593253616	2.6450392726805343	3.402863844476851	
I was very displeased with this move. Everything was terrible from the start. The comedy was unhumorous, the action overdone, the songs unmelodious. Even the storyline was weightless. From a writer who has written successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. The actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all. Of course, Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds. I think Hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done. They tend to exaggerate way too much. In Chinese films, this style works because that is their signature piece. But, Hindi cinema's signature are the songs. A good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic. But, in the future, I'm sure these action movies will get much sharper. Also to be noted: Comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly. Good Luck next time.	-5.429179317627978	-3.621698395489623	-2.933563973375384	-2.4737237704380686	-2.42877107089065	-1.9486697639243509	-1.483980189089357	-0.3079542001150022	-0.2048788737045419	-0.19893163926075505	0.03628572793658849	0.14688016158299733	0.15548886513857874	0.2728042682056681	0.42266107138790954	0.49360017617015867	0.8193442270598832	0.9204773564604298	0.9825891629025433	1.4204968948903292	1.5265031376433416	1.7855358288383392	2.0201301000307974	3.9291188432087067	7.852011729065522	
It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. Things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing CG colors. Not much to recommend here, even the title seems to propel it into obscurity.	-2.834919107023039	-1.2310904951964772	-1.1738963999751202	-1.1664061847010978	-1.1445306239551758	-0.7481270477026551	-0.36262034910559454	-0.3510375656986036	-0.3271118940358583	-0.2289723963339524	-0.19027851686295336	0.0024893176962852287	0.051775488205818385	0.06360359269989746	0.08849982206410487	0.09011937538816261	0.1483509704959829	0.2092266849711829	0.3256999792062718	0.5154073953861598	0.6303428499528199	0.6391632808395095	0.7586633216401327	1.522787942077156	2.9885155557235867	
With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity'. Obviously, it is not. For one reason, many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set-ups (when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen!). For another, his concealing of one important information: the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film. That is, goitre, a sickness caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research (heck, if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he'd have found 'goitre') he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people (still, doubtfully). Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly, talking about them as 'cretins', again and again, dramatizing the action, setting-up scenes to create the spectacle, all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all-mighty objectivity. Bunuel talks all the time in this film, not letting one word to the people he is filming. He talks FOR them and, even then, JUDGES them. This piece is flawed to it's roots, to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film.	-5.110308178615266	-1.8623257707384606	-1.8035815279168785	-1.378660192753604	-1.2828286287232307	-0.9167438604442533	-0.7764328308588805	-0.7518760632385756	-0.4736591191671736	-0.37992609174828906	-0.36448551633944964	-0.07376242054484912	0.01993561393888925	0.11442298195320244	0.11567176037138663	0.37985718329766266	0.4701256858812367	0.5611479047725173	0.5627009989127563	0.5849694959123626	0.722709032662825	0.7615350093755376	2.0685046164659577	2.438426700999554	4.957629211896293	
The "Wrinkle in Time" book series is my favorite series from childhood. I have read and re-read them more times than I can count over the last 35+ years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are near and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story that I love so much. To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement.<br /><br />If you have never read the book(s) I imagine you will enjoy the movie. The acting is passable, the special effects are well done for a made for TV movie, and the story is interesting. However, if you love the books, avoid this movie at all costs.<br /><br />I found this statement at the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said of the film, 'I expected it to be bad, and it is.'"<br /><br />I, like another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind.	-2.1494567518142507	-2.0784897284017685	-1.9046948261228411	-1.6001369991237886	-1.4406642583902132	-1.1255495053222087	-0.9419627950873498	-0.6939685500853154	-0.43813167189060104	-0.20450279743614988	0.15766065661483358	0.19623164655665973	0.26336502952618396	0.2777779484831399	0.30805746293915914	0.5569305634596579	0.5921038196070757	0.6513069779421508	0.7113675554526102	1.1886914810260785	1.27800645383141	1.4930682433441003	2.5574550154966107	2.6124025106809223	3.7028013274807208	
Felix in Hollywood is a great film. The version I viewed was very well restored, which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films. It has some of Hollywood's most famous stars making cameo animated appearances.

it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. i did not like the film. it's crappy!<br /><br />there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid.) the story is just dirty and shameful. i wonder what made those people get up with this story. and above all: who cares?<br /><br />the technical stuff didn't satisfy me as well. the sound is poor, so is the editing and the "direction" is absent. the actors are admittedly fine, but guess what! it's their job! their job is to act! no need to jump off your seats if an actor did a decent job. do you applause when a bus driver brings you home safely? see?<br /><br />i gave it 2/10 because after all this thing had something that i can't put in words. b movie charm? camp fun? nudity? i don't know.	-4.648923727348142	-3.0432483623714353	-2.645750233707245	-2.0800383603445396	-1.4749350266558203	-1.2507148768693994	-1.2016783522910486	-1.1705158074379651	-0.698301648027553	-0.46801138828998684	-0.2475155266294011	0.015413652351784733	0.10299489313785781	0.17116157284885064	0.3047465370549322	0.37458199982814394	0.38067085129977013	0.40473568583918984	0.5546666860248627	1.0691510251523915	1.2585554633545055	1.4075169727549506	1.4596769901147324	2.46099756541842	5.016767124470637	
I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their "real" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not quite important after all. You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. I am on a journey too. The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.	-5.442191576691754	-2.2814122835598276	-2.234512706856848	-2.2254802125890074	-1.486121912878741	-0.6920321680507013	-0.3941834924251787	-0.306532194339746	-0.028253352071875827	0.0389245394613081	0.26424235469935065	0.2786240074768921	0.5006971598594745	0.5592951467344948	0.7473955802864615	0.8479137650223523	1.0655680481643766	1.1506833801822665	1.3568192505490813	1.4488487312325933	1.6170462273060162	1.8180409767810148	3.847913721431954	5.090702231418788	5.224582824692599	
What's fun about Barker's Nightbreed is that it's the story of a human on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this one, the monsters (the night breed of the title) are the "good" guys. It shares its sense of celebrating the different, the twisted, and the dark with the first Addams Family movie, and much of Tim Burton's work. It also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by Barker.<br /><br />Especially fun is the performance by Cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the Nightbreed. As happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks. Only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic "weapons" with guns and bombs. And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.<br /><br />This isn't a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work. But it's pure fun, it looks great, and remains light without mocking itself. Worth a look!	-2.4971333371286226	-1.730266295538704	-1.7098965097198977	-1.2164397317831535	-0.7601722176502622	-0.5186994571215473	-0.1414188179828805	-0.1224013492499618	-0.11446490336904713	-0.034653982383002546	0.1570854562309543	0.32179070143224275	0.4386936794923534	0.44583478997023707	0.5194661427226736	0.5365996404107561	0.6275684353331085	0.7335216735714505	0.9395650589105672	0.9908343956795379	1.5452330107061663	1.9124094037224677	2.1570350098113895	3.188210337747603	3.4351054806171666	
This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, LEAVE IT THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS MOVIE... Although ashamed, I do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this at all. They play it up to be "A Sandra Bullock Movie". She only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. Well everyone has to start somewhere...	-1.5667585038861145	-1.0655468983740042	-0.9346982983805879	-0.6888918133674027	-0.5009716908477242	-0.3274999777476253	-0.31866708286903783	-0.2847247656191897	-0.20503231147707593	-0.16343614780390017	-0.09793285412533162	0.018567879063897882	0.035911661630421934	0.04360880765836829	0.054529509646435576	0.05983412132830476	0.06152440306527718	0.20405366586417314	0.21148769077583796	0.37377050535318534	0.4055611312816001	0.659122751812749	0.7100501198754594	0.9031605643150724	1.6926865672849267	
I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film. I even got the rental company to give me my money back because I argued that they perpetrated false advertising.<br /><br />It's not enough that the movie itself is a p.o.s., but the cover art is what sold me. I've done better make-up effects on my children at Halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art. Can you say "raccoon eyes?"<br /><br />I'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details, but come on, the movie's main character is an L.A. cop who was born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent!?!

I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior "Rebecca." As others have said, you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor, only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger-than-life yet deeply flawed relative. You have the stern and disapproving servant, a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart, climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead.<br /><br />Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to "The Letter," the Bette Davis love triangle set on a Singapore rubber plantation rather than a Sri Lankan tea plantation.<br /><br />Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" just two stars, and IMDb readers aren't much kinder, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked lovelier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father. Dana Andrews -- a favorite in "Laura" and "The Best Year of Our Lives" -- is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history.	-1.6024400075569336	-1.558547812367503	-1.4922055047901743	-1.2106643746051433	-1.1578562875855014	-0.9713149282686762	-0.8395669655418223	-0.7665774318530101	-0.12481984208550445	0.022196568347609247	0.032660594707087015	0.06928145283894066	0.09940722271510415	0.10983533828981318	0.18459934651717946	0.339577460397189	0.37919128686808484	0.39047165409053075	0.48995283604706713	0.5541783898062292	0.6358042333265047	0.8976979989629927	1.36703142435292	1.9602655198406755	3.3072670801756643	
Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, "Falscher Bekenner" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum American re-title ("Low Profile").<br /><br />Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests. It starts out with a grabber, as a haunting shot of a desolate off-the-highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter, who ultimately walks by a totaled car, where supposedly a brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead in a gory mess. Stunned, he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine.<br /><br />Just out of school, the drifter turns out to be Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition. Persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job, he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it, every one with the same fruitless outcome. Getting mighty sick of it, his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion: claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit.<br /><br />Pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise, he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown. As the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter, as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he's doing nothing out of the ordinary.<br /><br />If you seem confused about what exactly is going on, don't worry about being the only one: this is about as far and coherent as the story gets. The plot seems simple enough, and perhaps due to it's seemingly direct purposes that's why "Falscher Bekenner" becomes pointlessly convoluted, becoming enamored with endless false conclusions, dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument (supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland, or something about youth's fascination with crime. Hey, it could even be a coming-out movie.) at hand. It spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols, both tangible and surrealistically allegorical, but they don't seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest. <br /><br />The most fatal flaw, however, is how the filmmakers paint all it's characters in a rough shade of vanilla. There's hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal- perhaps too normal- family) catalyze the already under-developed lead character's "plight" never comes into focus. How are we supposed to identify with this young almost-adult's rebellion, with little sense of the world he's living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it? <br /><br />Many people drop in and out of the movie (including Armin's sort-of girlfriend Katja, and a strange, affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies) and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever. They ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next.<br /><br />And even a movie that supposedly toys with reality (especially with Armin's nightly exploits), it ends with a literal, almost moralizing head-scratcher that seems to halt questions to a "story" that does little but put it's viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion.<br /><br />Without any color, it's impossible to shade anything vital in.	-12.95214301530596	-6.65097137885319	-5.953529975144226	-5.702508697614204	-5.546756078062024	-2.776442786411289	-1.5520852556619196	-1.403717887648476	-1.1278344082669085	-1.0467482602356544	-0.974563112737594	-0.8103364899661907	-0.8009634698607973	-0.6884920971318484	0.6392734239249759	0.6403109275986999	0.7321135014483684	0.7980935319777007	1.0292152135972727	1.3470960906842449	1.5623093065270819	1.795035127338122	5.0396258067716015	6.497783246000271	12.77009084972891	
Roy Rogers stars as Jesse James and his look-alike, gambler man Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Mr. Rogers's ex-pal, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a noteworthy team, as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero.<br /><br />Of course, mistaken identity / impersonation is a plot development, since Rogers essays a "dual role". Rogers is charming, as usual; but, there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll/Hyde performance is done in by poor material. The better pair to watch are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye as the St. Louis Journal reporters - they are the film's highlight. The songs are fine, though badly synched. <br /><br />*** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm	-2.0489261073931577	-1.4424849730941474	-1.0188261596645303	-0.503343175401767	-0.49136734413818667	-0.4050749041453121	-0.32416708526197185	-0.3229941843329638	-0.3185657102210061	-0.2863947349903181	-0.26437456310866175	-0.08175682854174397	-0.04046786887908378	-0.0018228112518702648	0.00636444769059033	0.23340196625045156	0.32645559510069233	0.5418746407633381	0.6173270451340888	0.6526616650562054	0.6757218904754877	0.7122752446013485	0.8232110263536053	1.3388462071622602	2.468746027778363	
Dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making. The storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action, slap-stick humor, touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions. It's hard to believe that there was only one director, as the style changes from episode to episode. A must-see movie for anyone who likes anime.	-1.0125881495455027	-1.0106122740182186	-0.942202353713428	-0.8260281740754296	-0.6298638161330636	-0.595525441969059	-0.3424629279208229	-0.20651299367798548	-0.19028951149623216	0.008521668072549157	0.049665866647534945	0.13981671854910988	0.1804694204035697	0.20599706884309296	0.2454450622180762	0.3490743336350793	0.4186874411540091	0.4210749867289759	0.6096610650754779	0.6421520360702457	0.6427916461683282	0.7051182430829346	1.416352055890751	1.496518453673262	1.5947711004792748	
I loved this movie from beginning to end.I am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love(skateboarding,drawing) but my friends were always there for me.Music was like my rehab,life support,and my drug.It changed my life.I can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say.This movie left me speechless to be honest.I just saw it on the Ifc channel.I usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite.The ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it I never would have found this movie.Im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don't do a very good job on translating lines.I mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess.I almost never got to see this AMAZING movie.Good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed..well earlier than usual.lol.I hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and Love this movie just as much as i did.I wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film.I Give It Three Thumbs Way Up!<br /><br />This Movie Blew ME AWAY!	-1.1993245447071321	-0.5411354570017015	-0.5400711195103792	-0.5002061029701265	-0.24889465026895974	-0.24801779473995136	-0.21543041332392726	-0.18329268969678447	-0.15708229784097372	-0.14598373081634375	-0.1119347823476321	-0.10895406163200325	0.002973303942119865	0.005552388748516185	0.046530476667663134	0.06093161914808995	0.0694706047437465	0.08648727230272196	0.09672525860860964	0.2183498504913479	0.23141260143477427	0.2707760522462566	0.4097701912065547	0.6236936769669393	0.8095133570397158	
If you watched this movie you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe!!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both were popped in the street.<br /><br />The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all. It would have been much enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.	-4.92589547299563	-2.8945669307956976	-2.3594675224786372	-2.039525727166097	-1.5520512993439566	-1.4019594757457488	-1.2080843427632018	-0.6288236802859658	-0.3301903459746147	-0.09042654701737386	-0.06952010643661025	-0.06272224342701643	-0.019297893997407826	0.1635352058488012	0.28927058832529784	0.45272183770981833	0.4603273591171474	0.6053150063721264	0.9253649297902025	1.0222068144654946	1.2652061063543298	1.2835371182422912	1.7818196203055856	3.5655427590759645	6.098019976865166	
`The United States of Kiss My Ass'<br /><br />House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.<br /><br />The gambler Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty. He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts. The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet.<br /><br />In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film. No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order. This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension. House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime.<br /><br />The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.<br /><br />An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 9/10	-5.224817053411423	-3.910250943877616	-2.8290742698467466	-2.435619937188189	-2.1102363775699478	-0.7289661453446484	-0.5824459387599314	-0.020626783901768517	0.17587877987140735	0.5393172116011767	0.6575330926443853	0.8104444516944318	1.0999130274389428	1.1065667512829607	1.3696802317903818	1.5503373700964567	1.5817209728219548	1.7460395449238895	1.7592799086210484	1.839303331666401	2.107578078121472	2.1499084949119016	4.4969538352778455	4.818562593970417	6.031333467031536	
Being a fan of cheesy horror movies, I saw this in my video shop and thought I would give it a try. Now that I've seen it I wish it upon no living soul on the planet. I get my movie rentals for free, and I feel that I didn't get my moneys worth. I've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time, hell I'm a fan of them, but this was just an insult.	-2.3633591466486905	-1.3320095510002006	-1.2382761313257107	-1.2106289793520708	-1.1313662495229528	-0.6510100766109679	-0.518421368862199	-0.5129386601031474	-0.40822230052907416	-0.3209311316432679	-0.31000775601734953	-0.2960158949580417	-0.2180035098999127	-0.11776956567435456	-0.015366922910572456	0.018230444292118578	0.18049645311095838	0.3692664825974905	0.3795469648535249	0.4667450747087373	0.5908189870958405	0.7662896613563459	0.8580369021542827	1.332522595376533	2.504165321175819	
This movie changed my life! Hogan's performance was nothing short of incredible, and I still haven't recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 Oscar nominations. And as brightly as the Hulkster shines in this movie, you can't discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film. If you haven't seen this movie, drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy. I guarantee it will blow your mind. And if you don't like it, then I just have one question for you.... Watcha gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and Hulkamania runs wild on you!!!!	-1.2803260514345558	-1.1776326149061418	-1.1698264813497807	-0.9331939859698066	-0.6495423543403519	-0.4427080070836868	-0.315043185181434	-0.2378611679217202	-0.22837093211183584	-0.2244194622394943	-0.17039324722671906	-0.11010409616768398	-0.09732775185897874	0.07656692069076985	0.12349994138038692	0.18488021022185086	0.28418010632669255	0.3194498649594575	0.43935185100286334	0.5404193366447141	0.6560800195855969	0.725330634893031	1.2793667286484023	1.623184209040125	1.9685004961624366	
I found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept my interest, but the other 11 odd shorts really didn't pique my interest or make me think of anything at all. The music and 8mm footage all seemed to be so random that it all just seemed random. I would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free.<br /><br />As for the music being so in step that didn't come across either. I rented the DVD because I thought it was all stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action and only the first short was SMA, the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action. There was paper cut-out stuff in one, and the rest was outdoor shots from an 8mm camera with the music bed. Just didn't have any meaning to it I could see.	-3.377949373792516	-1.5833155632812923	-1.4045613348023616	-1.2591981801448624	-1.1500259521934542	-1.1498505125347909	-0.6686931463124333	-0.5554138761465579	-0.47086257170020823	-0.4222297452772382	-0.26465128309393654	-0.2391128035736204	-0.2066269251034599	-0.0890498206573146	0.025996263284214532	0.11567846757353012	0.37910938869269484	0.4845503399590698	0.6144432956600061	0.6528626116013958	0.7556498043701844	0.9216630568147667	1.1068278489689876	1.733799532289116	3.527810036944741	
Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.<br /><br />When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is "wait a minute, you don't?" I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why. "The love story is too cheesy" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.<br /><br />And finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.<br /><br />Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I've ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br />I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.<br /><br />I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.<br /><br />I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.<br /><br />I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.	-8.50725943458097	-5.393634896272117	-5.18361282428584	-5.176757593463257	-3.996894355085105	-1.8764073768610308	-1.8256412022284163	-1.1736581036482407	-1.1692338124655892	-0.7790934359451599	-0.694248774371862	-0.05595881479147255	0.11989518337602371	0.25460185007500297	0.36936175750852496	0.4176959862904005	0.43371841526692234	0.5887844101396021	1.6797603432902302	1.7501624304805639	2.3802308459508583	2.973713280069469	3.3285468360268076	6.553218933513233	11.029535265985421	
I have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film. One thing I see, over and over, is annoyance with Megan, the idealistic political scientist, trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe, because I am a 23 year old political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I relate to Megan. Besides, she's cute. She's no super model, but more of a cute girl next door.<br /><br />OK, so she cried and screamed a lot. It's very dramatic, and seems overdone, but doesn't it fit her character? She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick. I think she made her argument very well. Of course, being a young naive girl, she is terrified of what she is about to face. I think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. Furthermore, I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in.<br /><br />As for the movie in general, other than Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. It had excellent gore scenes, by micro-budget standards. The plot maybe took a quick thought, hardly any contemplation. It's basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film, which the name implies. I love the sadism of the doctor. He kept ripping Megan's shirt off, not just for the cause of sleaze (though largely so), but also to torment her, before he kills her. The Chainsaw hick was hilarious. For slasher film lovers, he was probably the best character.<br /><br />I give this film 4 out of 10. It had a good setting, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro-budget horror.	-4.596884336130842	-4.108615311966154	-3.51825874396807	-3.247201074691416	-2.3021698864323783	-1.4864557653857309	-0.816857997459928	-0.8165056674469449	-0.7376191510224748	-0.6151511823719593	-0.12055561668238338	-0.11546809762420444	-0.10733729390970857	0.28999437837438685	0.3257876706520684	0.8330196353823215	1.1777422345136117	1.2304459105901715	1.3588608615426683	1.5735810299377315	2.1713171100675273	2.315365057126936	4.910754856798414	5.049205310133216	7.99964659966036	
I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. I was stunned. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple. <br /><br />The movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go. You can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. Even the little moments just melt your heart. <br /><br />This has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever. A masterpiece.	-3.054547797424247	-2.627779434606275	-2.0077073358270714	-1.3705073818322049	-0.9972557307501755	-0.7208212656814514	-0.4476054025276176	-0.3575803503110305	0.05925558972612789	0.12616839121894166	0.15215466109055678	0.2925501779643827	0.406570370339593	0.6202369215589421	0.648517406629504	0.9085906259428933	0.9305117878668792	1.2167269604202997	1.2436957915024398	1.2970026917929602	1.3187310566711887	1.4095575945872811	2.6823329633069095	2.926707950557603	3.613382481200412	
A very enjoyable french film. This film has many twists and turns in the plot and is superb.

As we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known. The two leads always have to get together. Late in the third act I was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together. A clue was given right from the start, but you'll never realize it until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It Had To Be You cover a lot of the usual ground, but takes a fresh spin when ever possible. I liked all the NY characters and I loved the locations. It's a postcard of NY. Also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it. So, if you like a good old fashion romantic movie ... then this is for you.	-2.3692722565178075	-1.8707399252305326	-1.4931365729938288	-0.8568833538298091	-0.3882102036358518	-0.35792852770671735	-0.30823034515174863	-0.27715053123697764	-0.18966979108664256	-0.16596831341035614	-0.07577276283401319	0.04296256243163739	0.08422753797625976	0.25337442594036147	0.2715346110258082	0.38932223667707766	0.4022167955621365	0.42644785628690723	0.5470099879406677	0.7981326924664986	0.8351041327121138	1.0334489257263038	1.5583150231920015	1.7220459022884351	2.5766192854677095	
"The Man Who Knew Too Much" falls into that Hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s: not a masterpiece of suspense by any means, but an awful lot of fun nonetheless.<br /><br />James Stewart and Doris Day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue. The famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert, where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score. The impish Hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is, so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist.<br /><br />So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn comedy "Foul Play" that I have to believe that film was inspired by this. Neither film is a big deal, but both are easy to enjoy.<br /><br />Grade: B+	-1.1171202095484307	-1.0274074013140886	-0.9193366929851063	-0.6807050729988298	-0.5865349331717439	-0.4506790355158393	-0.2698363485644007	-0.26222796924670827	-0.2558149531956063	-0.12832307193685377	0.022892774327457392	0.05884334931809876	0.0644387145895157	0.11713150750114042	0.15119300878781322	0.22955882437128644	0.2722423290386528	0.4229814938439592	0.5054942323902021	0.5504793444549793	0.8950247122817152	0.9540426783253244	1.0460535654354675	1.18047209175596	1.481692569725078	
Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, was his first attempt ever bad!<br /><br />Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood film. It has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of "Reefer Madness" going insane for no reason.<br /><br />Sure, you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there. It is a psychological/horror study of war. The characters became dehumanized and insane. There are people playing more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. And there are a few interesting shots around there. But really, this is a mess.<br /><br />Of course, I am not discouraging you from watching it. If you get a hold of it, you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it.	-4.884337689479177	-4.389473129826684	-3.123833412359819	-2.7615243552817574	-2.124563405422359	-1.9011290737048705	-1.3422939207524216	-0.5996560506400638	-0.5905225332874913	-0.37773399467399715	-0.22478377257218193	-0.052967995239044045	0.1569966543361945	0.4579750857479698	0.4817754814261025	0.4964002759679732	0.7773773590014464	0.8132732729475909	0.8362241639756951	1.2335844748435092	1.2514177659145775	1.4287252933268506	2.2758810535718754	3.535976008136464	5.913041686501867	
Dull, cheap sci-fi thriller, made with an almost total lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only ONE MAN, and is VERY poorly guarded at night), and full of campy sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few "I'm here strictly for the money" performances.

A story of amazing disinterest kills "The Psychic" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (as is Fulci's mad camera work, which is usually a redeeming factor in his films), and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found. It's padded out to an insufferable degree--by the end, you won't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom (and, like me, maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie. Fulci gorehounds beware--there's just not much going on in "The Psychic."<br /><br />3/10	-3.3505008921241535	-2.0475210960218932	-1.8629948456603436	-1.7079935811418112	-1.707359285670893	-0.7574631501177284	-0.6023031004387458	-0.5779124279286715	-0.40582854461382867	-0.32886112797579525	-0.2855096026540384	-0.11864741336831645	0.03954268121553868	0.048088507882356496	0.14490999762379764	0.23236956693133054	0.2852894919443519	0.4529705002223765	0.46925600022322705	0.5820760672471685	0.6761659333743031	0.7393564081817462	1.0680151813627816	2.011723939878636	3.452873142926484	
Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. Whilst shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got progressively tenser, this just stinks. The Radio DJ, "we must stay on air" spends effectively no time on air. He sits on his bottom and watches the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a single person in the USA or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word "zombie"? Well, by the 50th minute this bunch of misfits are still calling the zombies, "the infected ones" or the ones with "rabies'. The word "Zombie" might make a guest appearance later, I could care less. Maybe there's a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words? Like the Bluetooth earphone is called "the ear-thingy" I kid you not! To finish, no plot + no acting = no-one cares. A waste of time, a shameless, poorly executed rip-off.	-6.904952646006045	-3.1397370171570462	-2.7376501175956056	-2.3005226458869013	-2.276643227619392	-2.045808411193473	-1.9424336139634468	-0.8617335641010012	-0.6013439974924146	-0.35499573410360996	-0.34158034451984354	-0.05716563903053837	-0.05614962767939054	0.22894120069831003	0.2576196705722013	0.29513183890718875	0.3133431306043685	0.338843595523504	0.4124274123163434	0.4849863813399894	0.7567163032738513	0.9884083909444789	2.8354462527591164	4.435202543131868	7.139354400836881	
I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it scared me witless for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to (obviously) the violence. My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie. I think they only say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it ;0) I am currently reading the book (out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and it is really a great story. However I don't think that it should have been made into a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way. Gives me a little heart palpitation every time. Yah I am a wuss but I strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids, read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content. Not everyone finds it as disturbing as I did but we are out there ;0)	-4.978599437892798	-2.3005744112782804	-2.1689308686928395	-1.514020109031367	-1.4557909338123065	-1.3188874444249863	-1.0185797522570132	-0.7798889741265752	-0.6714407445752213	-0.5997363989068786	-0.5212471529227298	-0.4517585479698874	-0.24785511632452006	-0.09408745676715291	-0.08706139382271544	0.25032477849926177	0.31003644599236524	0.44239539453213556	0.6417898919179768	0.7953843738033989	0.8522369457178002	1.0715695272480563	1.5784059676813211	2.283624201698525	4.757656188738587	
I can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />In a no-budget way, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck.<br /><br />This film should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those "festival films" that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it "different", therefore good.<br /><br />Bad film-making is not "different", it's just bad film-making.	-3.2070049489073105	-1.9818753412826722	-1.9771968491485792	-1.8419045231704765	-1.4444855543764965	-0.7336911780129507	-0.6767474112592727	-0.5078258852256021	-0.43673041326029916	-0.18994941509850805	-0.09763866384321443	-0.09192372090008495	-0.07595423957451272	-0.02265325075760273	0.27927386670446724	0.2843510325312233	0.29072371817618936	0.33315459895983424	0.625683916728691	0.66653510783876	0.7271661541928418	0.8148665245361655	0.9224495889032877	2.352989713758431	3.493847177353512	
This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kong's 'New Wave' that began with Tsui Hark's "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain". Tsui set a tone for the New Wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. "Burning Paradise" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.<br /><br />It's not that there isn't humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.<br /><br />When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' of Red Lotus Temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. He is the very incarnation of Milton's Satan from "Paradise Lost": "Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven!" And if he can't get to Satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.<br /><br />That's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: It's not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. Thus there's a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.<br /><br />Of course, fortunately, the film doesn't end there. Though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (If you want to know how, see the film!) Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. Hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all.	-5.311743251383029	-3.5481980002395015	-3.294080691530556	-2.4127395348319824	-2.2767590795934014	-1.3836966789400642	-1.1815948312281621	-1.0209917714856052	-0.590693381645443	-0.4200191365823365	-0.13923379004852993	-0.13249663981507834	0.0834645167579397	0.12021210615090756	0.30459852264280435	0.40128077359686537	0.5565727211454471	0.8028567319495565	1.4405409387266381	1.4447146997518099	1.4619348671047852	1.5390155085318815	1.8318959253502	4.576535421935572	6.995069441679248	
The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved) is Father Pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine. The cast are not too bad, though most have now retired from acting. The film has terrible sound effects (mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems) and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky, for instance, for what feels like hours at a time. Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way and the production is adequate. Interestingly one scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band's assistant Bennah Burton. Despite its plodding nature I genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it.	-2.3413214940249616	-1.7388775927706457	-1.390193086246075	-0.9283497012517512	-0.6071672557899559	-0.5997614214489945	-0.4812852316251744	-0.4649139151350087	-0.4407858830531257	-0.21881936107165462	-0.19259103551999368	-0.09288300315503924	-0.07665240831906077	-0.06415535178091339	0.043520710172599175	0.22657426704008918	0.24099579619223918	0.29976882708937924	0.6441773195550209	0.8581433881457988	0.9562598617934188	0.9771610775831202	1.021813894319943	1.921905631713966	2.9536715056923635	
I attended a screening of this movie. It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups. I think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast. I'm amazed this movie cost $3-$4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? It obviously didn't go to writers for re-writes. Nice thought to bank on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a major miss. There was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best. The direction was uninspired and looked like a student film.<br /><br />I don't even know what it means Everybody Wants to Italian. Is that a real saying. I've never heard it.	-4.707349989996522	-3.202561737130091	-1.9119955767217909	-1.7800469319422785	-1.7333560527331053	-1.2043891528833301	-0.999132598806147	-0.5898611243015681	-0.3013182030098846	-0.14122374708826027	-0.008311788175519301	0.00642539857268247	0.042000966465267735	0.12231117705606112	0.28937492715683427	0.35650733787573047	0.36245544464585444	0.4360799270399162	0.5672187655671372	0.7597511133860152	0.863760206212358	0.9064474333269531	2.0852853110308884	2.385744793002161	5.455569065474133	
Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film was okay. It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others. The problem isn't with direction, acting or anything technical. The movie is just destroyed in the third act. Why? The murders, twists, turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes, THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever. What a let down.	-3.278803606168598	-2.4147507330653886	-1.67134128007426	-1.2949212481116494	-1.1760541186073596	-0.7661118556168908	-0.7508499584863609	-0.49732668794574286	-0.3978518543666722	-0.12651038706848644	0.0020729719001548255	0.032463845792187265	0.07288962529314776	0.19978515439990643	0.2282947514328942	0.24732500948167346	0.3385821828634017	0.5582455071224842	0.5619797570881919	0.6236305725434883	1.0427020353371703	1.2535557996185862	1.4691052728496357	2.0122835129423233	4.3180491852491425	
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a film I hadn't seen or even heard of.<br /><br />Now I like slasher movies in general, but this is just abysmal, not even good for laughs. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever come across. Now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had, but not here. Painful example of home-made horror.	-2.2798506432271517	-1.5803486442430543	-1.502783483273657	-1.2513670136818364	-1.1295124909327159	-0.5545919994725294	-0.44662950671783086	-0.4083122319484823	-0.4022444561787607	-0.3711195887948552	-0.28779272978645887	-0.25507332964638096	-0.1445159860130812	-0.12812569494241893	-0.03416018936601731	0.022894131504900578	0.1501673149973718	0.1664956748789101	0.18688036932749677	0.35235777550048997	0.4801102854782573	0.9167123757400725	0.9903146631034727	1.745546057728194	2.550837658360457	
Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well.<br /><br />It was filmed in England (nowhere near Morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. At the outbreak of war, everything was moved to America and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - "I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it". It remains a favourite of many people.	-1.4284647751834807	-1.0651433146356946	-0.7121987825733799	-0.6777316924823376	-0.5964307077764295	-0.4824319196822235	-0.42042170181583083	-0.3766566778536078	-0.3758756728647394	-0.17183409680042067	-0.07536062544737057	-0.06544090012335557	-0.047580532021154615	-0.02948870888346866	0.05363122942071863	0.0686289523971146	0.12122215493135975	0.2905007825168623	0.3338881663803417	0.45106377240156115	0.5786613627075099	0.8060307401563485	0.8537506658794272	1.2605561022029033	2.298546114340448	
I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it was cheaply made. Badly scripted and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it. The witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was nasty and very strange. I really can't understand why someone would think that would be entertaining. It shows another scene where Dr. Mize arrives and Betsy Bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers. Instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother. How sick? The little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects. I think they should have left all of that out. The makeup on the Reverend James Johnston as a older man didn't really make you assume he was older. It made you think he was dipped in fish batter. The blood on Joshua Gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse. The John Bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man. To me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture. These people would do better if they film commercials for local TV Stations for bathroom products. They chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner. I rate this film Capital F minus.	-11.448334454856672	-5.364640513065507	-4.9115571686056985	-4.246632474127475	-4.062130982325127	-3.9766109377369787	-3.806775645370801	-0.9435224553983802	-0.738457654975297	-0.4925674581524232	-0.27398897234755615	-0.20043488967694312	0.2097193416298253	0.25216781993318815	0.35698400670844066	0.5387704785417055	0.7778580541955993	1.5698296237058682	1.6968149188672246	1.7053352887198676	1.7946892524372422	1.9208065537314352	4.235583707595055	6.172364720777213	12.743975863163126	
I saw this back in '94 when it was finally released. Apparently because Orion pictures was in bankruptcy, I think, the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier.<br /><br />I have problem remembering details partly because I haven't seen it in a long time, but I do remember it as a very dull movie. I kept debating whether to walk out of it. The store was not at all interesting or engaging. Was a 3rd rate America Graffiti imitation. <br /><br />None of the performances make it worth watching either. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating.	-3.50779921726731	-1.670647162356441	-1.2838133440988677	-1.156558205024918	-1.1003813164895544	-0.946237741226895	-0.7458511573807746	-0.4395677985104666	-0.4344147046668908	-0.39804692393665914	-0.25002668008673806	-0.2447826489064564	-0.06571700861184505	0.11042390811756529	0.13853463129810428	0.3352914422722097	0.35651787365256293	0.3704209737536468	0.4582749960214891	0.4963112661696105	0.5587408034797211	0.5840134594985661	0.9106383592737779	1.582257589116665	3.401816889346419	
Okay, just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started out good but became so boring after the first half hour. *spoiler*<br /><br />It tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way. She always wins the competitions, therefore pushing the mother further towards "eliminating" her. After talking to a "hitman", the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit. So actions are taken but she eventually gets caught.<br /><br />The cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening. Don't waste your time watching this.<br /><br />	-3.739196240918044	-2.440851810155985	-2.0458183205557736	-1.8236866100528168	-1.7349985192859845	-1.3201975827148218	-1.1081041614640026	-0.8412931008875949	-0.5991526865277631	-0.5855475409122729	-0.15226061543177394	-0.0808932432298751	-0.00920887493161339	-0.007138928859386593	0.038339797507015515	0.39843071002492997	0.4091663568668544	0.6195469886748374	1.0224890183689315	1.0536997661540282	1.1282569819966084	1.1398405002482215	1.3952175231331838	2.3165875801295535	4.192672997416903	
I saw this movie years ago, and I was impressed... but then again I was only 12 years old. I recently re-watched it and want that time back. This film is pretty bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (watch My Bodyguard (1980)if you would like to see a GOOD movie that he was in... of Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, this role does/did nothing for their careers.<br /><br />Anyway, Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is an ex- race car driver who plans on driving his race car (which he had in storage) across the country to California. One Problem: The government has outlawed all private transportation. I thought the concept was OK (not the worse I've heard of), but the execution failed horribly.	-3.4459732462512074	-1.6792609155440865	-1.4613096841538704	-1.429054260534416	-1.1380300891452644	-1.1171025767190081	-0.913014422211139	-0.5000860041380097	-0.4627597340841376	-0.33305095591704703	-0.07458069460522765	-0.04150623257761286	-0.00839726490866348	0.018677082056825264	0.04267510507409915	0.06163557452125764	0.08234838201715972	0.11593365288085256	0.47867887577972457	0.6305844832383695	0.76909035044422	0.804866227290857	1.0613907309078638	1.986747888051928	3.7329152476340934	
Excellent performances and a solid, but not overplayed story, helped this movie exceed my expectations. This movie was far better than I was expecting after some of the reviews I had read - but frankly those reviewers just got it wrong. Very inspiring and uplifting.

'Radio' is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy, nicknamed 'Radio', and the football coach from the T.L. Hanna High School, Harold Jones.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as Radio! I would never imagine to see him in a serious performance, specially because most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones, but this actor IS great, so this is not anything new.<br /><br />The mentally challenged young man called James Robert Kennedy, always walk around the T.L. Hanna High School, without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. One day, when the football's ball is throw near him, he decides to stay with the ball, for the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met. One day, Cash decides to punish James, mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up.<br /><br />When coach Jones discovers that horrible act, he stays angry and punish all the team, deciding for this day on to help James, who gets the nickname 'Radio' because of his passion for radios in general.<br /><br />The movie shows how Radio becomes an adept assistant, helping the team train despite hardships from the players, and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city. <br /><br />I would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson,specially showing us how a person can make a difference, even not being what we call ''normal''. Radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone, and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives.	-2.5273440720492912	-2.4951040746961337	-2.0310012487855156	-1.8631561455467487	-1.8147195651919632	-1.5448146244608632	-0.9713609859451112	-0.898566055097487	-0.7414272560891626	-0.20852725262507776	-0.08551226319348579	-0.028027876633692606	0.10899304881464955	0.16549755636792352	0.322235716310254	0.3903144460517598	0.8184534212051554	0.8317298990879147	1.015721619787547	1.0956464956088032	1.2079217312653772	1.3601395044561138	2.4311314105139084	3.1577784667317754	4.620606066429405	
Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director. In keeping with Miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script, this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with. What takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same-old however, is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's cinema. And this isn't that nice cool, clean violence so beloved of US cinema - this stuff is nasty, painful and HURTS! That said, the pace is breakneck, the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities, Miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be, making it hard to look away from the screen, whatever he might be showing you! It doesn't have the "Ohmigod" ending of "Dead Or Alive," but if you're not squeamish, now's the time to get on board the Miike bandwagon before he ends up on some Hollywood studio's "new John Woo" shopping list...	-2.0960325666689332	-1.2515946168607834	-1.2321602361911665	-1.1647101710479952	-1.1559083712235678	-0.7592492296586859	-0.5034689473007747	-0.2822781317706046	-0.09660809504518476	-0.010355547551454222	1.963652617882096E-4	0.00313520911975727	0.09888713422653024	0.14446901262010647	0.17173573821201554	0.17378869911018852	0.19095992826299202	0.25055010470717626	0.3505088283905617	0.6443712047481962	0.6799427021370849	0.7263886790657864	1.098490267907286	1.5784464824202664	3.30873376617531	
This entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - its the best ending of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, simply wonderful.<br /><br />I found this movie delightful, even with it's French taking-itself-too-seriously deep meanings thing going on.

The saving grace of this film is its humour. Playing up to the strengths of their star, Warner Brothers cast their version of General Custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism; it was Robin Hood all over again, and Flynn blossomed in the role. All his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing, and this one was no exception.<br /><br />It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; the part of strong-minded Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later films, and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de Havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part. In this final collaboration, she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is, at heart, basically a romping adventure movie, and the screen chemistry is rekindled -- for once, she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple, to equally winning effect.<br /><br />The Flynn/de Havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability, when most of Flynn's other Westerns -- held in such affection by the contemporary American public, although allegedly not by their star -- have long since been forgotten. The action scenes are fairly cursory (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the piece turn out, schoolboy-fashion, to be the same people who were horrid to Our Hero on his very first day at West Point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career. It cuts down on the cast list, but it's a trifle too morally convenient.<br /><br />However, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. Ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players (memorably including Anthony Quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the Sioux leader), Errol Flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal: charmingly sheepish looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous twinkles, flash-point indignation, cheerful fellowship and sheer high-octane charisma. He's a reckless braggart, but you can't help but like him. And it's hard to go away without the tune of "Garryowen" threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter.<br /><br />This is one of Flynn's lasting hits; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun, and is a film worthy of being remembered.	-2.5552001731802347	-1.959398951982111	-1.9327549871286291	-1.7816928581468137	-1.555575806161469	-1.5135527440143322	-0.7883241691851364	-0.4156374863710195	-0.2311049007867313	-0.16538739442704486	-0.11840691663983838	0.03032119911754072	0.0939284425438495	0.14885706239280785	0.1746441611507898	0.4488854918767814	0.5786733253935605	0.6328281512553486	1.0990517583083093	1.306723417527164	2.4445933040367214	2.730691686225697	2.9335505794074366	3.5690312671861015	5.52877931212359	
The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie. I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before. Some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie, but I think it's the great plus of the movie. It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006. It has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content, dramatic feeling. This is no americanized movie. Neither is it a predictable movie. You just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be. This is no excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.	-2.561847031075732	-2.0243243991299167	-1.6335598699292428	-1.6108217447806543	-1.0524941262051226	-0.5371617699971565	-0.47097637457259434	-0.26162439401291443	-0.1048062610878065	-0.0947435334559773	-0.07594089338085205	0.06030389742536679	0.1638624097101241	0.24862320198586588	0.7084236893161513	0.7420963315290301	0.7621743786521518	0.8323312212686307	0.9210524297097755	0.9227474060625953	1.2346513192729045	1.2525210088586614	2.9985331709698655	3.0271618658714794	3.781959956021256	
So...we get so see added footage of Brando...interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy stuff. Susannah York was hardly a slouch. New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets. Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that...let's listen to Donner make fun of Lester's version that made more logical sense. The president talks of the Zod "defacing" the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd. Superman's "freedom of the press" line sounded silly compared to "..Care to step outside" which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to Clark's earlier scene in the truck stop. Then there is the ending with the "turn back the world to go back in time" effect. It turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for Hackensack, N.J. ever went since it doesn't free Zod and company any more.	-2.4804965910812755	-1.921061403691142	-1.4119864196027494	-1.2900267038510804	-0.8692890283305666	-0.7417487192973811	-0.513962246827322	-0.5122258054586845	-0.3007773828695885	-0.22665917956133885	-0.19467310403654886	-0.17087786004545966	-0.14833972237296317	0.010817516638642576	0.16589048014802887	0.24273501507895875	0.24670363505115867	0.27846330898305777	0.2989104331109625	0.4786777334190678	0.6209805094057098	0.6867037823303199	1.0865232254497115	1.5050581522754716	3.3505847465371623	
I have read the whole 'A wrinkle in time' book and then saw the movie. The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting.<br /><br />A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin must team together to find Meg's father and get off the island Camazotz. <br /><br />The beginning of the film is really a stinker. The acting is awful, the direction is laughable, and so far the situations aren't necessary. I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book, and a terrible film. The acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting. Yes, I got to admit there was cool effects. But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible. If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie. I wish could give it a 0 but sadly I can only give it 1. A half could have been useful.	-6.306553218055661	-3.347938970219372	-3.321342703887351	-3.1657660228756246	-2.854813476409658	-2.0957572286469848	-1.8672533365429516	-0.6421308892200935	-0.613705564982319	-0.41255683915222213	-0.40482048465720366	-0.324886382960119	0.058916222900866094	0.16065600528391122	0.5586576167942671	0.6484548322450289	0.6755644211152512	0.7090222048258008	0.7685117492045246	0.9225189381269996	0.9545055648710371	1.4551587319828814	2.588514692476777	4.177046759891317	7.052490283688501	
I was browsing through Netflix and stumbled upon this movie. Having fond memories of the book as a child, I decided to check this out. This is a movie that you should really pass on.<br /><br />It is just not worth seeing. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel that it would even be that way to small children. It has no magic that the book contains. This movie is not horrible, but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it.<br /><br />There are moments that just come off as weird. The witch character is not very good. The family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening. I know this is a kids movie, so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things, but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before.<br /><br />The DVD that I had began skipping in the final moments of the film, and instead of trying to fix it I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I really didn't care how it finished. Skip this film and read the book instead.	-8.35421567919767	-3.8217339693330485	-3.7932142959430823	-3.687541589287674	-3.435979044548957	-2.370633558037714	-1.5109856833529696	-0.764517278222791	-0.7099054449358818	-0.705610542427255	-0.5084056525998795	-0.107165317502561	-0.0018092285581597645	0.0856871857043977	0.5869893733985071	0.6421424748311235	0.7996781447543273	0.8256258352476027	0.8836473163691597	1.2100727674399765	1.4061716833957143	1.6935016561494403	2.659277008218975	4.929801427617269	9.155078674266955	
I won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating, plenty of other people have already done that. Suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that I've owned on DVD, this is the ONLY one that I got rid of- it was so worthless that I couldn't see ever wanting to watch ANY of it again.<br /><br />However, I do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). While skimming through the 4 pages of reviews I saw no rating higher than 3 stars. Looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less. It looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the IMDb "bottom 100" list. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars (none of who wrote a review of the movie) are actual active users.<br /><br />Don't be fooled, this movie isn't worth your time.	-5.182941592496521	-2.0601422713223094	-2.002939476626246	-1.9104150761133392	-1.7730667186694604	-1.7588063709962178	-1.7321758552073672	-0.6691646907744573	-0.2696447550683706	-0.21531286624071486	-0.17648737870348627	-0.0709844149466437	0.028175259023764096	0.03172868819122447	0.18926700138774558	0.20220564997140889	0.30148051004568727	0.36276570483715004	0.46021197779062895	0.46325120407655823	0.5604178907683403	0.9465241831943056	2.3797068436523032	2.514132503234074	5.557134836672347	
The fluttering of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the Chaos Theory, I'm not sure exactly how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly-unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect each others' lives. (The six-degrees-of-separation theory can be applied as well.) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film. The acting is finely-tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is luminous), the stories mesh plausibly, the humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement.	-0.9598740502186908	-0.8689255983970317	-0.6484015870450615	-0.4590939015204155	-0.45410191963862484	-0.24867256365490542	-0.17068575107560047	-0.09565631460570839	-0.09098386230703578	-0.06301533103660054	-0.0428027036098569	-0.016939969134876862	0.031177851207083107	0.054215224228583936	0.1828213161525239	0.21857839650707142	0.28058270823968984	0.3470742178986363	0.38178269568740997	0.4920245471447483	0.6007254342181068	0.7901504299542076	0.8813131196376507	1.1146325599144276	1.3706995581524086	
Well, I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Sholay. But you cant get a Sholay every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures of "not without my Daughter"(Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most "inspired" movies go, this one was a well-inspired one, well handled and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, but all others are commendable. Specially so about Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her grace. In fact, she has performed much better that when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age?<br /><br />All in all, a nice watch.	-1.6269656117853009	-1.5036240004098753	-1.4040352657977209	-1.0303523162549415	-0.5538153646069363	-0.5537379345254044	-0.5065650808990475	-0.26475555053121497	-0.10389073159227197	-0.07985163946130416	-0.04054138129485911	-0.0057293471353775105	0.015757390257813753	0.029270645128880127	0.03011625226409016	0.13665201608507355	0.17631057850430637	0.22079905446440834	0.38961744139270515	0.5597913473714872	0.6613885745375998	1.2390706284168764	1.3655885872552287	1.707345208107955	3.1233313536239833	
I saw this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time... What stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say. This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through... they don't break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.<br /><br />These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they're not that different. Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone. Anyway, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.<br /><br />Now, what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness. Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes. And, the addition of him halfway through the movie (though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance) is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs. I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.<br /><br />Considering the target audience, who I'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues... I think I'll give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. It's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think.	-4.5561938829449895	-2.929626315839661	-2.556648116239224	-2.517921656755831	-1.8955253275584674	-0.933618367334855	-0.8379818532936565	-0.6032235164225788	-0.5919925537518284	-0.4559768589810657	-0.05689728670974756	-0.04019507917827059	0.005622889074056489	0.06584916160768414	0.15734835301791367	0.3371609435403986	0.5147249056965009	0.7081488643027303	0.8444321080310339	0.8807036401124895	0.9962736048339942	1.3772707773324326	1.3914667538771321	3.335092756203785	5.835981225313166	
This is the first out of the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection.<br /><br />It took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films. I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date. So I popped this sucker in and sat down.<br /><br />From what I had read on the internet, and realizing the content involved in this film, I was expecting to test my nerves in full force. This ended up not being the case.<br /><br />The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point, and how long a human can tolerate pain.<br /><br />Sounds like one sick flick right? Wrong. The film fails to shock. This may be because I have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror, but I think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease.<br /><br />On the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen. Though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence. Including the ripping out of fingernails, intestines thrown at an unconscious woman, and a needle through the eye.<br /><br />Overall I think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it, but I suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one.	-8.05858664671358	-3.507604031249216	-3.3871393485321186	-2.932477422856983	-2.929366107874177	-2.0939122098146026	-1.133513424766605	-1.0137316719519822	-0.7012400505799687	-0.5843590940084571	-0.5141134543857534	-0.25561522771286055	-0.08098654411995472	0.3612704974927442	0.3791329452788996	0.4348704602360005	0.5128010424626173	0.7527602904846011	0.8161354754691074	0.8951074243740796	0.9572928163077087	1.1453224754985976	3.5389635721421464	3.687955930619342	8.13941372897393	
Count me as being one who is happy to see no Hastings in this episode. The poor-man's Dr. Watson does nothing for me, as he simply drags down every scene he's in. Japp is often necessary to the story as the representative of officialdom, and a little Miss Lemon is fine for seasoning, but Hastings swings from painfully dim to over-mannered in different episodes. If I have to sit through one more vacuous "Oh, I say there!" I'll take the gas-pipe.<br /><br />As a general rule, the more Poirot you get in a Poirot story, the better. Every line for Hastings is one taken away from Poirot. And I've never read the books, so I really don't care about fidelity to Christie's characters. A lot of viewers/reviewers seem to have a problem with separating the movies from the books. If you want the book as written, then read it. I don't see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage. Theatre is not prose - don't expect a transcription.	-5.488960331807561	-2.2901292957126342	-2.035143436979087	-1.890209317651041	-1.7083846166179044	-1.6834474987304757	-1.473048015515769	-1.0204806758046807	-0.599758274270048	-0.4390978375032627	-0.2427365432721123	0.22768157789642293	0.2768251030321853	0.3595046665490067	0.37488355265493944	0.46720661773124805	0.5192015242832084	0.6154988802525658	0.6515609030307498	0.6764655884860296	0.8573138281874734	0.9822629967784136	1.995399119263995	2.630487410407229	5.838489555188469	
As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure. I've a feeling I'll be watching this again and again for years to come.<br /><br />It's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film.

I have to differ from the other comments posted. Amid sporadic funny moments, there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny. The strain shows. I watched this with two friends on another friend's recommendation- none of us were thrilled.	-1.2114375793177237	-0.6042654752514178	-0.4913725657360811	-0.48876713553679985	-0.44159792950012616	-0.38703621039196207	-0.3265909263722553	-0.31198641943478134	-0.18440072082735803	-0.16954765600658434	-0.07489733351931072	-0.0023685463696264675	0.10344224901816965	0.11599518871533154	0.11956547321865797	0.13854274282175016	0.14559769691607358	0.14649082068850938	0.1598700727658621	0.18284161432848817	0.222644392269273	0.2389768818631391	0.42002113157478127	0.4774761728362602	1.4226997639509784	
One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find, if you are lucky, in the video stores, is they are very accurate retellings of actual, true stories. Farewell, my Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much Hollywood, and especially Disney films.<br /><br />In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along an having lost his only son many years earlier, he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. From there, the story get very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera -- a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera. It may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati, but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality.	-2.7317914025003245	-2.347462650096872	-1.666886090238018	-1.1941559009772384	-1.0119911648790805	-0.3670062528434965	-0.26607366309491975	-0.05856527392872364	0.09444397919712359	0.30080263288921033	0.3210375654159037	0.44758451344211964	0.5839562245265429	0.6168295580418524	0.6315808759727056	0.7326853361019755	0.739512543008559	0.7417810058562584	0.7645949746782754	0.8865438316628655	0.8985768431143255	1.3271799140549783	2.0776525758873703	2.3773814161442046	3.1200614105371463	
It's a horror story alright. But perhaps not as you know it. The real monsters in this flick are humans. While the monsters, are human and prey. As weird as that may sound I see this as "Monsters Inc" for horror film fans.<br /><br />Sure, the effects are of a std horror film, the monsters are there as in any monster based film, the gore is there as well, there even is a slasher in the shape of Dr Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see flash of Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here - or is it the other way round?). And it is Decker &c who are the bad guys. The monsters want mainly to mind their own business, warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided, wanting to join there society.<br /><br />By the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters (and the dog) - not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes....	-3.9557650788684127	-1.9090293532522742	-1.4638748991360142	-1.0659914699750515	-0.9911218851404044	-0.8291843730581512	-0.7352032322233903	-0.5857477757780063	-0.4359456053440993	-0.2960053269113618	-0.2572278137590398	-0.07546264202507601	0.18747748167623265	0.19981497879446075	0.22877571856323586	0.29670464506518474	0.3658308562419947	0.39069615303459637	0.40935957601217043	0.4402060516136189	0.45932817808556775	0.5148031865500541	1.421857991952184	1.80489675657147	3.5467367126742073	
A gem of a cartoon from the silent era---it was re-discovered by CARTOON NETWORK, and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades, if ever.<br /><br />What makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos...Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos; Will Hays pays a visit as 'boss' of Static Studios; as well as appearances by Chaplin, Keaton, and William S. Hart. The image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace (a money-making idea for Felix's near-bankrupt shoe-=salesman boss) cannot be described--it must be viewed. A terrific cultural gem.	-1.717808347348147	-0.913077857401104	-0.5693281777639088	-0.5395876213526221	-0.3422516841911844	-0.23814488270748282	-0.2375638975471303	-0.10393026227675999	-0.06060330834520842	-0.03979668019954069	-0.02405788090935201	0.18230911759153232	0.2880415885489739	0.29475474402391677	0.3988171085978478	0.42905492095930825	0.5435334034162955	0.5512138896209147	0.8309872387545771	0.89001779104575	0.919301690633071	1.005894319424701	1.0823154414754015	1.1964469538162392	1.4272819433141484	
Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason. Furthermore many changes have made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) in the movie "Paul Renauld" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to be killed. This is completely stupid because if Renaulds plan would have succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld.(Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs Renauld identified the victim). 2) The movie has "combined" two persons into one! "Cinderella" has been removed by the movie. The girl Hastings falls in love with and the ex-girlfriend of Jack Renauld are one person in the movie! Why for god's sake? 3)Hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player. Totally unfunny and stupid. 4) The movie tells secrets much too early (for example at the very beginning). So you know things you shouldn't know. 5) The murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn't exists in the book. Perhaps because the person ("cinderella") who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie. 6)The book is very complex. The movie takes only about 90 minutes. Sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning (e.g. bicycle race).	-7.696964535255703	-3.4032041712188987	-3.363792195761542	-3.0883619776151128	-2.9730595261666912	-2.7426117055876276	-2.3661873719713373	-0.8915385224217754	-0.7857798484232548	-0.7171759889560129	-0.24984535167647343	0.10213290707861417	0.22846621930502192	0.3354679125864348	0.3651891641422418	0.4159364238912214	0.6516811766225008	0.6676514207969606	0.9002295948892745	0.9847773553276534	1.0197161346670525	1.1397255399683706	3.7235524456133775	3.7764302943131938	8.80983817774852

I agree with the Aussie's comments for the most part. However, there id seem to be a fairly decent plot, if unoriginal. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge. She gets reacquainted with Chip (Bobby Johnston) whom she had known when she was growing up in there. The plot thickens when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane) because Christina had been James' stripper friend in years gone by, and the implication is that James had done her wrong somehow. To add interest to the movie Sophia Linn (Monique Parent) a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge, as do Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), pair of lawyers from the city. James sicks the local building codes inspector on Christina's business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down. So the question is, "How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed?"<br /><br />Watch for Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty Betrayed." She seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the "R" world. Another notable is Samantha McConnell, playing the role of "Bait," clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies!	-3.9321534596194323	-1.9218823332669548	-1.4001072417299913	-1.0920325062142457	-1.0701765273710973	-0.8685948846811986	-0.7681764351119207	-0.7582404706606959	-0.3164389121372677	-0.06766949484477472	-0.010534259247711342	0.0197502193887496	0.10918911124501718	0.13150816417656105	0.2535076119124686	0.4507167526781818	0.45910278006286787	0.4645191313378677	0.6251849341538784	0.6910893942359921	0.7153176513861096	0.9074117170943381	0.9431666205361363	1.8189886819807894	4.439647658784449	
Now I'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so I had high hopes for this one. Then I came on IMDb and paused --- I'm always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we've got another --- a bunch of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real low ones. I'm also suspicious of 10s with the word "visionary" in them. <br /><br />Sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them. Despite my misgivings, I saw this film and have to side with the ones. The stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish. Treat yourself to the real deal get some Svankmeyer and leave this also ran on the shelf.	-4.013740794580521	-1.9256562799304162	-1.7294636624616868	-1.3920375075601175	-1.3455313044857382	-1.1584048048949458	-0.6925970006480946	-0.5926617723128346	-0.500735413986059	-0.3614821216028878	-0.35853716936980407	-0.296976100819277	-0.056528412810984835	0.12141254620553382	0.17227049755190627	0.215318616081409	0.41796053142694045	0.5558600835907489	0.5834263040491822	0.6524490939922265	0.6585408035503361	0.7673961812802808	1.1225710620569722	2.2627828020115004	4.376027663815724	
When you go at an open air cinema under the Greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is! Edison started really good with some good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be actors and a once again great Morgan Freeman but... (In a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience,done, a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action ,done, and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie...) when you see 30 elite police officers (packed with weapons that can demolish a building) shoot at a guy behind a car, fail to hit him even once while he kills all (but 3) and then the guy takes out a flame thrower (to kill the rest 3) ,you realise that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this!	-1.0584199288675884	-0.41695668214918064	-0.4034769664465513	-0.3612588882191144	-0.3313339887260857	-0.2746869197998805	-0.2539745661496614	-0.18587698273547265	-0.12561142684288645	-0.11494759639179851	-0.05511847961988273	0.020670127503355527	0.027064107343452354	0.04730863758702903	0.06944481764851962	0.0696341974389783	0.09071669964604993	0.1226953236615371	0.13968320039222362	0.14126818355034937	0.14142925388877964	0.21665032208836765	0.44756673910858014	0.490655424903373	1.0290856786431486	
As a writer I find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face. Talk about insulting. I was writing better stories than this in 8th grade. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure. <br /><br />The only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time. Who would green light something so poorly written? It's not artistic, clever, smart, suspenseful, mysterious, scary, dramatic-NOTHING.<br /><br />The characters are flat and boring with no development. The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to line a bird cage, not a movie. <br /><br />Oh and last but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow. <br /><br />Avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an STD.	-7.636980896715391	-3.4650093948673706	-3.250433056162109	-3.1157556685343124	-2.929635357462818	-2.398478247575094	-2.1160210709730127	-0.8045292954273301	-0.5537509436080852	-0.4565524592299585	-0.3265697345111344	-0.04020159988719371	0.039017455483195865	0.09754209369549968	0.23837440355152725	0.38250059909338124	0.4108601984967159	0.478095764050935	0.5474563504557135	0.9092907496071376	0.9580663786290208	1.2291661737082809	3.635342309781096	3.827275355431955	8.031254154191004	
Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos etc...How do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one token black. This was typical in the 80's. Hey! it's 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes working as actors Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention to his cast.

Many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years. I was inclined to agree with this until the influx of Asian horror films, a trend which has admittedly grown dull. However, it has produced some true classics, and A Tale Of Two Sisters, for me at least, stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema, and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time.<br /><br />Based vaguely on a Korean folktale, it tells the sad story of two mentally-troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother. After experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home, they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship. The tension rises and there is the inevitable snap. But what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes, as the story takes several twists, and the scares become more emotional and quite real. By the end, you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind, but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to watch again and again, if only to work it all out.	-2.46692397481371	-1.3794039791398853	-1.255208842945589	-0.9010980033937118	-0.8272393571135632	-0.6959875988495212	-0.4039671872423853	-0.34422378996215036	-0.2759192998823442	-0.2695963063478819	-0.22447812765539163	-0.1684213077420237	0.053153145788026324	0.08129704082771279	0.15159070714459955	0.32640082425739103	0.4105524583708246	0.46828635253134454	0.4703013592223355	0.4835226773808867	0.6756999508536317	0.7686423396337114	0.9958605288275051	1.5201106656012204	3.5577548395235463	
I love the frequently misnomered "Masters of Horror" series. Horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment. Projects like this (and the similar "Greenlight Project" with gave us "Feast" - like it or lump it) are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror.<br /><br />This one began with a kernel of really-kool-idea and ran ... right off the edge of "where in the world am I going with this?!!!".<br /><br />I don't know how to spoil the spoiled but "SPOILER AHEAD" All of a sudden ... no, there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier ... we have long haired luminescent aliens (huh? ... HUH?) brain drilling males and ... yeah, I get it but ... well ... the worst curse of storytelling - a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement.<br /><br />Cue to storytellers ... your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up. Not the other way around.

I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher wasn't involved with this "movie". An American leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in Hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx didn't make an appearance in Hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Perhaps we'll have to wait for these California spin doctors to butcher Paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.<br /><br />Cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs. All the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered - while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the "other side of the aisle" - to not have been a conscious effort. The singular exception I noticed, in the hour and a half, is JFK has to have sex with Marilyn Monroe for eternity: The token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non-partisan.	-3.94692597620552	-1.7926072542070615	-1.5402409378291424	-1.4420622224846105	-1.406781923380762	-1.3727753163288385	-1.0288029611035858	-0.5816852506254058	-0.3787140208629546	-0.37425516174310675	-0.2988903668631461	-0.16267407634120762	-0.0999532019665024	0.022380922972816908	0.060195592632614085	0.21380008244174084	0.2527778679315471	0.33125115420459084	0.3855215879105129	0.4250889539366015	0.46283408967325046	0.5061510665009286	1.762720260877781	2.039945261747537	4.340751608912656	
A country-boy Aussie-Rules player (Mat) goes to the city the night before an all-important AFL trial match, where he is to be picked up by his cousin. And then things go wrong.<br /><br />His no-hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark / drug-dealer Tiny (who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively Australian). Needless to say, Mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos, and it isn't long before thoughts of tomorrow's match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night's frantic events unravel.<br /><br />Accomplished Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy Mat, and successfully plays a part well below his age. Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and an entertaining role by David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events. Roll is fast-paced, often funny, and a very worthwhile use of an hour.	-1.5163852196726524	-1.4085975092151375	-1.2702304806914757	-1.0346377369105264	-0.7709637625891393	-0.5826485978911748	-0.5643120798746677	-0.3064792485858171	-0.2693605547091902	-0.08392639971135121	-0.06645566204732006	0.14814850713192967	0.30047838905943586	0.3288343222090784	0.465590402785422	0.48781277478093577	0.5635826332243232	0.6077836832656252	0.633041327403317	0.6978519142792545	0.8099887576406225	0.8165714096177021	1.4997944292174052	1.956746077905774	3.498026705182687	
I LOVE Jack's jokes like 'The cliché is...' or "Over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky...". He is just hilarious! Daniel's starting to catch up on him to! Good thing Jack's not on the team anymore (in a way) or else it would have been sarcasm mania!!!!I just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I'm starting to pick up facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c...It just all theoretically possible and exciting...oops! Their I go again!!! Sorry, I'm also starting to pick up traits from Carter, and all of this is driving my parents NUTZ!!!!!!!

Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her lover James Franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby.<br /><br />What more would expect from a rotten slasher film with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end. This is BAD cinema. And this movie is sooooo poor. It makes it look like Halloween mixed up with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this.<br /><br />Rated R for Graphic Violence, Nudity and Sexual Situations.	-3.938163116060233	-2.1484779400145717	-1.647758791603054	-1.5008050767357966	-1.2212151133287485	-0.9493457314989133	-0.9300003936238784	-0.4000198166032459	-0.3558795935093965	-0.23800651429383107	-0.1937621228629141	-0.09046628439234117	0.009346195522767053	0.29070399049500695	0.2944279326328636	0.3955761691474208	0.5671911294977525	0.5738864691791241	0.6194826648117018	0.7593635624685662	0.8171959161924036	0.8288176055463838	0.8910683806516881	2.1383147302783527	4.382878580796309	
Just two comments....SEVEN years apart? Hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling-power! As has been mentioned, the low-budget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. Having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.<br /><br />True, the plot at its most basic is a re-working of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror. More a case of intrigue! Gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played Halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the "house" as the main suspect. The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard. It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.<br /><br />Having picked the DVD up for a mere $3.95 last week at my regular video store, I cannot begrudge the expenditure. $10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. Just don't expect fireworks!	-5.1105886634983655	-2.6416690165491414	-2.030399991168556	-1.9983835233789806	-1.413702267763045	-1.2669640191756755	-1.2144828118138846	-1.0436999509554659	-0.5061676699599835	-0.3697052659707304	-0.10275752827099442	0.037357518398297054	0.1012327069458974	0.18307713305299897	0.21502953919834047	0.27770600800004996	0.33703257058839414	0.44854100368273864	0.47129652342341843	0.5064847160522301	0.5254320534071343	0.5859917158213384	1.6517517186906647	2.50355537733309	5.067941963289323	
(Spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it at a Blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that, I had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing it with "Night of the Demons," but, you know, they're basically the same thing. <br /><br />The parts I loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage. That black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed ALL the time. Even when screaming wasn't really necessary, he'd let out a "LISTEN UP NOW!! BLOCK THE DOOR WITH CARS!!!!" and so, they'd run cars head on into other cars. But, then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick I believe it was. The other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn't want to come over... To what significant aspect of the movie did that give us? What was it? Why was it there? Why did the movie end with a guy breaking the TV's in a studio? I saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was kinda far away. I mean, he could have just turned the TV off. Yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, I hated it. Good day...	-7.088806118001698	-3.2957454668091644	-3.0500441592481313	-2.7456440329383476	-1.9928025432694878	-1.7973081138921352	-1.4060258302712894	-1.3292837684255703	-0.7359290851149617	-0.45506712650418113	-0.009645983126765012	0.1084506397665054	0.3200331583902136	0.4182249948714002	0.5221756333027019	0.5538331173012473	0.6040154928717986	0.7424834658683233	0.7619499650643796	0.884607687507319	0.96007974450532	1.3755081814140575	3.152438068899287	3.1769541049774785	8.01318779586472	
A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. <br /><br />As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /><br />I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out.	-2.6038142959610635	-2.5674498500094587	-2.524774547548419	-2.1526039677306295	-1.173296943640074	-0.8289939848520707	-0.8142778679890276	-0.7312614322039728	-0.5568668357657957	-0.00297246940421194	0.01050027403650114	0.053828124487612	0.3365179393115756	0.476449911605666	0.5417579342882259	0.757454527071276	0.8004347931504292	0.9038922531210337	0.9915929711947014	1.0032840501081524	1.2834197368119498	1.371400110049203	2.987338099577601	3.7814341149013395	6.2694588960596125	
You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of "Death To Smoochy", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener", despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period.<br /><br />This is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic "caretaker". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.<br /><br />This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.	-3.354593625272656	-2.408504433235623	-2.34705949839141	-1.987669324384652	-1.4845918151456803	-0.9989356733759214	-0.8574610015976362	-0.460268807397744	-0.15000593951905383	-0.06752359005476717	0.14327822592066666	0.23972046781052092	0.3544071814228025	0.464179485525265	0.5412215138928727	0.5829879527794086	0.7166939144019971	0.8526918555785834	1.2516459399722206	1.3113374155315531	1.449410995842238	2.2965658000249887	3.390157757471238	4.12802739129606	5.232323087468075	
In 1989 here in NZ wrestling was somewhat of a mega-hype phenom, and who was steering starship at the pinnacle was the orange goblin himself, HULK HOGAN (one of my uber-heroes at this time), so it seems obvious to me now why I adored this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is a shockingly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse!!! The story line follows a standard WWE (then WWF) circa 88-91 story line culminating in the standard good guy beat down, hulk up and then get beaten down again story line only to follow that the good guy calls on all his inner strength( gained from eating vitamins, saying prayers etc etc ) to mount the epic come back..... Pretty standard formula here. Worth watching if only for reminiscing your youth!!!!	-2.447029153490599	-1.5390648372851132	-1.4967247081810826	-1.0884444627701566	-1.0654377376032702	-0.6446638627029025	-0.5593365487319238	-0.449220339633383	-0.26902145790554854	-0.25891406480264845	-0.15929565337259313	-0.0799170530027758	-0.052639012567798196	-0.007881037676398302	4.491207825007941E-5	0.02647463985492949	0.06863807234398425	0.2746056377633294	0.35630238707462836	0.42415462779230634	0.47212950589972813	0.5625567615327424	0.9614283062873874	1.2307376224119868	2.5219502543637087	
House of Games is spell binding. It's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens. There are few movies I've seen that can grip you so quickly. From the opening scene this movie just gets you.<br /><br />I'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO DON'T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.<br /><br />I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists I have ever seen-bar none. From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.<br /><br />Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.<br /><br />There were a few movies I've seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it's way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. You know something's going to happen but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the "something" is, you realize you haven't even scratched the surface....<br /><br />House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well. As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion.<br /><br />In closing, I'd rank this 10 of 10, call it (although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list), most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best "twists" I've ever seen as well. Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to movies of the human psyche, it really doesn't get much better then this. See this movie.	-4.9972524229167945	-3.934863860151084	-3.551627568665062	-2.5359111279214286	-1.4186567755478097	-0.40314396499858834	-0.3450382906798722	-0.18549957160878497	0.038694154251375845	0.3575542302019674	0.4219619760574067	0.6554046791799625	0.6786923506291266	0.7479498308870194	0.8469862355133875	1.013988368607618	1.36280898577781	1.715083922654082	2.0813347411015606	2.098934136943946	2.2305750544245235	2.259877904633234	4.676830813525675	5.810108655058216	6.152350280231729	
James Cameron's 'Titanic' is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event...

The visual effects are amazing, like no other film's... The decor is overwhelming... James Horner's music intensifies the emotions... The whole movie is hunting and involving, filled with a wide range of deep feelings... <br /><br />It's truly a moving tribute to those who lost their lives on that unfortunate ship...	-1.469791192353741	-1.430198280998806	-1.414987468900014	-1.1209887284339857	-1.073985893281674	-0.7735807800436479	-0.6644625443793806	-0.4692766009068994	-0.20721057091813339	-0.14541166610601317	-0.10763528435777009	-0.08349216874198259	-0.05982353979431021	-0.02111495694767651	0.15689016191633784	0.2286420293619109	0.3678056670142233	0.4420835016801372	0.7424524799459543	0.7986693592179294	0.9961553530398841	1.1052884111154928	1.570971170945643	1.848042839301843	2.0145197878700905	
I recently visited the Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mom, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just children, but when you see quality shows like Mickey's Philharmagic, you realize that the magic of Disney is for everyone! It was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I would encourage anyone who goes to Disney World to check out this show, which is not just a show but a world wind, fun filled ride with Donald as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble!	-2.0895437490587945	-1.7833361415026139	-1.0014075482298885	-0.7143010917698022	-0.505163131984832	-0.2834245430896096	-0.1872924632561596	-0.013368407420306344	0.04057055455417455	0.07788167731918219	0.12586972143291866	0.16589303373356046	0.22129817584342026	0.2237707613727336	0.35630587003747577	0.39140528027245003	0.45018974653046573	0.5130935750955475	0.700683138117141	0.7724590997121521	0.8763340149600277	1.009049713924477	1.3766429134934752	1.6115874653316826	2.2535825261373597	
This show has to be my favorite out of all the 80's horror TV shows. Like Tales from the Darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, PLEASE sign this petition I started, to get the word out for Monsters and get it out on DVD. Here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes would have to be Glim glim, and Rain Dance. I also loved the opening intro with the monster family. That used to creep me out! One of the things I would have to ask the DVD creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be. I don't know if any of you remember that part but that's one of the main things that brings back memories to me. I mean, come on! War of the Worlds the TV series already has been released on DVD, so I say Monsters, and also Tales from the Darkside, and Friday the 13th the series should be released too! We the fans need to speak our minds! We need this awesome show on DVD so PLEASE spread the word!!!	-3.8668609852930693	-2.4843588321316346	-2.4530683239761726	-2.091586488507292	-1.4782746317953617	-1.3643121204906687	-1.2525086973917532	-0.3538844792502704	-0.25066430575371385	-0.1538485848515853	-0.10580539632073144	-0.012289715329693363	0.0023991746253283486	0.005051135189627982	0.08183775182644866	0.25891753732188993	0.38420871047764665	0.630178951783389	0.900826842640926	0.9207705834713068	0.9423801598160759	1.1992944232720923	2.0362464437710908	3.3233681718660826	6.104456375576527	
I caught this one on cable and I was very surprised. Steady direction and some good performances accent a twisty and very engaging story.

That is the only question I am left with. Why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast? Why was the writing so bad, it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters? Why did it not make any sense at all? Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and "Hollywood" the hell out of it when all it needed was good, smart story telling? Why? I never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released. I hope for the sake of Freeman an Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, that this never is released to the big screens in America.<br /><br />As someone that holds a Bachelors Degree in Journalism, the whole story is just utterly laughable. I just...think the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a cliché, and an awful one at that. Just.

Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.	-1.735798656682808	-0.8189956829670462	-0.7894190736123895	-0.7586062225683586	-0.7021560803913978	-0.677518289853297	-0.5438913708899367	-0.14901957931443519	-0.1386249228790561	-0.11988182368605003	-0.09090347484317138	-0.06472848637352274	-0.05692478463363386	0.018241024801511255	0.1245464178268538	0.19851569206055955	0.21385330913222733	0.22365026185560943	0.2680438614616708	0.2701877519487276	0.30683036081882287	0.3402063173055235	0.5035855645248893	1.1519412813647434	2.074590518787727	
If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />As for Flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's depiction of General Custer in "Santa Fe Trail", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's "Little Big Man". Let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer's character, when he stated - "You take glory with you when it's your time to go".	-6.659406562441989	-3.942631349059144	-3.5387027340386235	-2.907707351174594	-2.341165988184865	-2.3055522027692805	-1.9271268844574756	-0.9142335355183158	-0.8567975741733396	-0.29196288094448747	-0.24610042536163118	-0.205836066609311	-0.053489398073149154	0.6468230427324448	0.6552000805199976	0.6932177464442154	0.7531257757304753	1.154608696331702	1.2373705663607426	1.637529471494753	1.7824213427160478	1.9927919598796024	3.1472780456202205	4.965291964363053	9.703188713227195	
This Film is the One which you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time. The most influential aspects about his films are sheer Simplicity & Gripping Drama. The another best thing about Hitchcock's films is a Definite & Gripping End.<br /><br />Any thing said about "The Man who knew too much" is less. The Cinematography, Acting, Dialogs & Camera Works are magnificent in this Movie. The Song "Que Sera Sera" at the end shall remain in our memories for life time. The film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends. Rarely would Hitchcock include humor in his films, this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie. <br /><br />This film is absolutely brilliant & as good as Vertigo.	-3.548144675250905	-1.6336394819904454	-1.4104054082808117	-1.3438713461097862	-0.9340003031509537	-0.36662790257580213	-0.23465439285785766	0.06677676485305181	0.27974316747475064	0.35023760450362984	0.4819084630285757	0.5218407550509467	0.5438617228589119	0.6152295569839532	0.9791898436186102	1.037935449841271	1.0596958015022555	1.065640056396774	1.148376126058797	1.425748575815334	1.4454663765885747	1.5889681533200302	2.212856485577785	2.5092453682947666	3.74717383285698	
This is a special film if you know the context. Antonioni, in his eighties, had been crippled by a stroke. Mute and half paralyzed, his friends -- who incidentally are the best the film world has -- arranged for him to 'direct' a last significant film. The idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it. So we have a film: about a director who conjures stories by simple observation. And the matter of the (four) stories is about how the visual imagination defines love.<br /><br />The film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination. The result is pure movie-world: every person (except the director) is lovely in aspect or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely, and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter. There is no nuance, no hint that anything exists but what we see; no desire is at work other than what we create.<br /><br />I know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. No one understands Van Morrison visually like he does. Morrison's Celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion: the sensual touch that implies but doesn't physically touch.<br /><br />Antonioni's redhead wife appears, appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster 'making of' film that is on the DVD.<br /><br />Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.	-3.30188980650619	-3.0378590757497017	-2.4827936350614968	-2.3080947625734693	-1.0943506940583139	-1.0797450570872829	-1.065698553707934	-0.7153620215114354	-0.6501744310030347	-0.4410019719147894	-0.24162713763499966	0.07746031403478862	0.08878041172140366	0.17019553794413478	0.3415415659230181	0.38027364470648956	0.4090745462663359	0.6818181142246196	1.7067723570148545	1.7376377095308069	1.816910376700105	2.195081136162483	2.9292277208087514	3.057217652739294	3.242359087377491	
This movie lacked credibility for two reasons. One, no mayor of a major city, and New York is certainly as major as it gets. Would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. All of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At 62-years of age, I have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. Even "Escape from New York," which was fictional, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn't resort to such deep-seated violence. In this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. Also, in this movie and I have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the "Escape" movie. Secondly, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be. On the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed. Yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. Outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack Bronson's character? This was not a great movie and I could go on, but I won't.	-7.441682238944155	-3.5431133817909997	-2.9889093980654744	-2.9388133514005683	-2.2195785132026122	-1.691027931461916	-1.423124596087223	-1.1487186808131116	-0.8098977694198852	-0.5904263485399223	-0.5361877397252239	-0.04717728052749069	0.42730788582590307	0.43462161565499585	0.4505293572875473	0.6677332133584358	0.7156059369808488	0.7449969369211512	0.8217790003496872	0.9432869880112096	0.969121923522252	0.9903421246525241	2.6413053415465235	4.377827364809725	7.481830777565307	
I can't remember the series, I believe it may have been "American Masters", but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge of the development of the A bomb, and those that have little, or none, probably think it is a pretty dry subject. Anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way. You get to know the turmoil in Oppenhemiers mind, and how the development changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he became, and why. With 7 episodes you get to know the major players, and the intrigue and backstabbing. I have contacted PBS about the chance of obtaining a video, or DVD, but have never received a response. Too bad, I would love to see it again.	-3.8308744199359737	-1.4680141876665906	-1.3927166795877008	-1.342511768585912	-1.2569087221309663	-1.2278205675718328	-1.1736317131482696	-0.5379868288146757	-0.5081473804574348	-0.4418261916551368	-0.21823015874846083	0.05306633534180071	0.1300103363526293	0.15533377291035816	0.21441818002629498	0.2186833725358912	0.30804141458565854	0.3097077975303213	0.33346090233963793	0.3645583733472689	0.5758841160268797	0.5815339391144858	1.3079089037594247	1.5786594854801619	4.0196720419517815	
1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies. "Friday The 13th" and "The Burning" may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like "Don't Go Into The Woods Alone" and this one. But in all fairness "The Prey" is nowhere near as bad as "Don't Go Into The Woods" but it's still not great either. One thing is that it's just boring and acting isn't very good but much better than "DGITW" and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at, all three of the female leads were stunning. One thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space.<br /><br />So, what was there to like about this movie? Well, there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments- I couldn't contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon-walk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes- my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag; and the phoney looking.<br /><br />All in all The Prey is dumb, boring and the killer I didn't find scary at all, this movie could have been a whole lot better.	-4.860813873490216	-2.570483579825872	-2.4578576320806182	-2.1912108105973167	-2.037866241302466	-1.4221027210019668	-0.6397162583249851	-0.5539115915652755	-0.542431594011703	-0.5339808877008057	-0.5250612319880674	-0.4515736603978386	-0.2716321029846849	-0.030521273053738016	-0.003601866934927306	0.21227598784091903	0.3368587978817221	0.44265439516659366	0.46765356530690433	0.7708036706003616	0.988950984365979	1.1362728482374642	1.6662306735778514	2.4933982771239678	4.995334675368719	
Awful, simply awful. It proves my theory about "star power." This is supposed to be great TV because the guy who directed (battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick. B O R I N G.<br /><br />Find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your TV with no picture and no sound. 1/10 (I rated it so high b/c there aren't any negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system.)<br /><br />-Zaphoid<br /><br />PS: My theory about "star power" is: the more "star power" used in a show, the weaker the show is. (It's called an indirect proportionality: quality 1/"star power", less "sp" makes for better quality, etc. Another way to look at it is: "more is less.")<br /><br />-Z	-2.4258797619741004	-1.6442105567606857	-1.252086451177637	-1.074173834491062	-1.0705585353158695	-0.32643974791364927	-0.3133461373839301	-0.2975207069351408	-0.2732342820787961	-0.2719108665388389	-0.2598391247617474	-0.2385420575491779	-0.21749383288975666	-0.173062127477273	0.012756598313195255	0.1335168889445404	0.19401378291992527	0.5685615734352958	0.7283637786931019	0.7946258195302018	0.8082878093361425	0.8403429272193307	0.8910872441945256	1.743216099239251	3.057491174677692	
When I saw this movie I was stunned by what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would ever give a 10 star rating. I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I don't think anyone could have a better job than Kate. <br /><br />If it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, well, this is the one. You will love all the acting, special effects, and much much more.<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!! You won't regret it.<br /><br />	-2.606008658932765	-2.1823733154275153	-1.5011831690678525	-1.3959059325649612	-0.7690876697547024	-0.2932199063933267	-0.22823142321014164	-0.09627639319345271	-0.012318150994410129	-0.010467741258772763	0.12601366041257442	0.13027757208062607	0.2234024708902443	0.2517610038007241	0.3071302261794549	0.3721916721573836	0.5164703676110306	0.5924810996066578	1.0894893648841277	1.0947929671010876	1.2056400460772632	1.2541431476593876	2.262237262776141	3.2605955774890547	3.270724566751784	
I have been getting into the Hitchcock series very much lately. I find myself always renting one of his movies when I'm at Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. Like I said before, Hollywood is loosing it's touch incredibly, I needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there. Not to mention, I want to be a film appreciator, not a movie buff. Is there any better way to do that than with Alfred Hitchcock's movies? <br /><br />The Man who knew too Much is another great and exciting thriller starring Alfred's favorite leading man James Stuart and the woman who steals the show Dorris Day. They play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when a spy tells James some information that could arrest another spy, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom. James seems to just doubt Dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back, but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick.<br /><br />The acting again, I would say that Dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast. James did a great job keeping up, together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film. I loved the little bit of comedy at the end that Alfred added. You'll see what I mean. I would always highly recommend this film, despite not being the best Hitchcock film, it's still a treasure.<br /><br />9/10	-2.3172940941193825	-2.2813904484661	-1.7033723725853813	-1.4273801455658237	-1.3456868868911	-0.6083862099333376	-0.4696875260799229	-0.46458826204052134	-0.19961915400090388	-0.1496033133540743	-0.12378094861779379	-0.003614415979013172	0.052508762691917336	0.24086606520016102	0.2416434634154667	0.3890702527764778	0.6453959706812324	0.8291069431749419	0.85323848197493	1.0021846261414473	1.1845223186674105	1.276719443520825	2.8373395359991305	2.899747936327684	4.3514266384461955	
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.<br /><br />I have watched the original from it's early days on Big Girls Blouse to the last series on Channel seven. Kath and Kim was a great Mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get.<br /><br />However in this American version I found it to be dull, Molly Shannon is to fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm. While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original Kimmy wore. I also found that Selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot, she is obviously a (Australian) size 12 where Kim should be (Australian) a size 16/18.<br /><br />The exchanges from Molly and Selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldn't be pauses or the pauses are a bit long, as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses. It's like Molly and Shannon are not used to each other, there is no Mother/Daughter chemistry.<br /><br />Phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like Kel. However Craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble Brett from the Aussie version.<br /><br />I found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play. The acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes. Especially her sulking scenes.<br /><br />To sum up, I find this show to be a waste of time, the script obviously has been dumbed down for Americans which most on the board say they prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the original.<br /><br />All I can add is Magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of Sharon.	-5.839032373471615	-3.666298636385601	-3.0601593438869794	-3.0499591019453187	-2.593784192687158	-1.146046727085813	-1.125868631231009	-0.8660218303280558	-0.8108196227047011	-0.7021995705842838	-0.5924940527195645	-0.3207487147233251	-0.06864913217322113	0.07784282042972798	0.148615705884939	0.5266189700352104	0.5378129317328793	0.6098337175745092	0.6808514205636688	0.7035162641018466	1.0991708802893638	1.6616851244104027	1.9932533100577619	3.622453480368208	6.383888870015153	
After 'Aakrosh' , this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as a director.Till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in India.This movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence. It was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released. This movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'COOLIE', 'BETAAB','HERO' in 1983.<br /><br />SmithaPatel, in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him. She was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs.At one time,she even gave up her love when the hero's ruthlessness touched the roof top.<br /><br />There was another character in this movie, which was played by Om Puri contemporary, Naseeruddin Shah.He played as an inspector-turned-alcoholic character.The role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero's ending.<br /><br />In his debut film,Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare.The cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent. The anger which left half handedly continued in Govind Nihalani's other film "Drohkaal". Even after two decades, this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew.

Now, I am not prone to much emotion, but I cried seeing this movie. It certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups, but there is something here for everyone. The classic song "It's so Hard to Say Goodbye" really makes this one worth watching at least once.	-0.9522990807835177	-0.541483773480264	-0.386230428795018	-0.30907700903481256	-0.19107905919120338	-0.13477889992044323	-0.12864095839881207	-0.039287290655490414	-0.027291128984681834	-0.018901815232787042	-0.01671300790841422	-0.015132088656381458	0.023201231196503108	0.02575640431544323	0.12471960461596004	0.214292775374389	0.22173667131660918	0.25194360783411013	0.2930460585321285	0.3165118678206768	0.49803120972361536	0.5476046562095365	0.5676142528081838	0.6242130002526448	0.6450900509098529	
A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot. The film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor's innermost feeling. Max, who has lived in New York for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there, comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend. Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well. The three women Max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations. His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see. She gives him also no love but only stability. True love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex-girlfriend. Merely a fantasy for him to escape - many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable. The one who really animates Max's life in fact is her best friend. The equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because Max has understand much more about his innermost feeling. The nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated. Not equally ingenious as "Pulp Fiction" but things seem much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to Romane Bohringer. The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful. A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing. <br /><br />	-3.477910049152128	-2.8104222244024966	-1.9805298039884742	-1.4082786872981918	-0.9213814719377943	-0.624385502471045	-0.4672919406315646	-0.19068403156516048	-0.013959510587187536	0.1570118997308883	0.5460569258641536	0.5726428411549749	0.5893712281541017	0.6451158747723681	0.7402451787077389	0.7467027422105816	0.8045443283137573	1.0348345339915848	1.095305048476342	1.3978263444436196	2.3279784188418504	3.029724778601498	3.1041150450161576	4.3950445084989935	4.659830875718138	
After seeing the DVD release of the Blues Brothers, and their mention of "Wired" on Belushi's bio, my boyfriend and I were hungry for more information on John Belushi. I had heard of "Wired" but didn't know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really p***ed over this movie and I thought it was because it didn't portray them in a good light. But that had nothing to do with it.<br /><br />The movie starts out okay, until they wheel in John's body to the morgue. When he wakes up on the autopsy table, and decides to run for it, then begins the utter tastelessness of this movie. John is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with "Angel," a Puerto Rican cab driver with a wicked sense of humor -- subjecting him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over.<br /><br />The two actors who portray John and Dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors, (let alone anyone else related for that matter, i.e., Lorne Michaels,) making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life... but that is the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />I believe this was supposed to be an "artsy" film -- John constantly being tormented by drugs (i.e., the powdered soap in the bathroom being cocaine,) in such a way that was also difficult to follow. The flashbacks are choppy, also making it difficult to understand.<br /><br />Probably the most tasteless scene was when John is (literally,) forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain while they remove his heart to weigh it, saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use, obesity, yeah, we get the point without the grotesque portrayal.<br /><br />There are very few other actors we know of in the movie, (where's Carrie Fisher for instance? They were incredibly close. And Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show,) it looks VERY cheaply made, (we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early 80s or late 70s,) it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all, didn't show the side to John at all. I felt I knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of Saturday Night Live.<br /><br />On one last note, Bob Woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie, arguing with John about writing his life story. For someone who was supposed to be very highbrow, concerning the bust on Nixon, his calibur of person could match any writer in the National Enquirer, and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward.<br /><br />SKIP THIS MOVIE. If you want to see more on John, watch his movies, see clips of Dan Akroyd talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on John that goes along the lines of "Man on the Moon," which is ultimately what we were expecting. I guess this was a "moral" kind of movie -- you know, don't do drugs, but I guess the creators of this film didn't understand that his death made a number of people (like Carrie Fisher,) stop doing drugs altogether for that reason.	-10.368922268077192	-4.859085980771638	-4.424264960950971	-4.417594339654389	-4.351421170126135	-2.337904218196546	-1.1791791563110523	-0.8910256768097394	-0.8251906787225894	-0.8208773201088853	-0.7933911411620371	-0.7603356480922044	0.10774074497842934	0.3019005523423498	0.42767897509155395	0.5602340903481706	0.9131787425431735	1.0172568745697266	1.3497374934834343	1.596973405901868	1.6911381074770944	1.7062190724187571	3.083463954003643	5.640613149818253	10.912483158478217	
I have to admit that I stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen, besides the dead body in the first scenes... and her disposal of him. I was wrong. It was a cinema verite of Betty hits the Beach encased for the first part by Mordant Morven. I really don't care what young lassies from Scotland do these days, who thy screw, what drugs they take. Visually, the stroll through the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me. The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend. As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts... 1. That's all there is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. "Bare Bitch Boredom, or What I did on my trip to Spain." I'm such a sucker for sticking these things out.	-4.060947944456441	-2.990607608404526	-2.104434149061628	-1.5258721139088762	-1.3189706446642078	-0.9409614261292144	-0.9029653072452867	-0.43088653716612085	-0.2456016529592723	-0.04300941455981246	-0.01409225662870462	0.13241070323519705	0.1919957188522713	0.21610545245494694	0.2556234513805096	0.2794935920512019	0.2940891633171548	0.42486937110851786	0.6877514729631522	0.7442713454171072	1.0190869162840321	1.3259975460501043	1.8319197322360141	2.2258564510757495	4.873710320604893	
The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved. I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team!<br /><br />One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Brideless Groom! All appearing in this short are Dee Green, the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre provide great performances here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There is another similar Three Stooges short like this one called Husbands Beware and I recommend both!	-5.8039571536302335	-4.612414327655413	-2.9366204889162097	-2.038736481847943	-1.549917957237854	-0.848866920010829	0.10055212148800102	0.1353757964468526	0.18017246902332462	0.37930733898800467	0.4894202183020535	0.5277664003503685	0.7494612503648832	0.8759381042322321	1.534936397995439	1.5919843380217218	1.7743021333200462	1.809313570858196	2.1632307834962727	2.522549020774709	2.724005488364591	2.8321527689842734	3.7711356338058573	3.877937684826051	5.4984718397471	
There are few films or movies I consider favorites over the years. The Gospel road was one of them. I watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again. My favorite parts were the fact that <br /><br />1/Jesus was blond, <br /><br />2/the last supper was a huge meal,<br /><br />3/ he liked playing with the children,<br /><br />4/His death was for all people and for all time.<br /><br />The movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting, but it touched my heart at that time. Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture. If it ever comes out on DVD, I will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons.	-1.3171721557313283	-1.255932438552941	-1.1809550680760612	-1.0682791564304226	-0.5978587945720809	-0.5418233855876177	-0.46912864557763817	-0.34144648241328834	-0.22325226089649203	-0.1733167366803937	-0.1546413259294121	0.0062356158790749724	0.03226553211438521	0.034204069159995694	0.03561251945632462	0.09156457202024135	0.2298409512560963	0.3256848551067022	0.36954021655055325	0.5900339841684925	0.6073335642272931	0.8373241663094404	1.2967413755854014	1.324847447596908	2.567267243742257	
A good deal of running around. A badly conceived adversary with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them, gets caught up with aliens. Along with his pretty wife, he invades their territory and is given secrets about them. He becomes rather traitorous in the process. Granted, he is given little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens. The plot isn't technically bad. It's just that we are usually following a car, a trip through a woods, investigating a building. This is what editing is all about. I suppose the story wouldn't technically support much more. Not much here.	-5.0855977549808244	-2.601984784098395	-2.369709060069104	-1.9806723690641004	-1.7415374905886882	-1.4951159453026897	-1.4857694571876987	-0.4159591508241996	-0.29754071462912657	-0.28014042118191185	-0.031441123789089975	0.02319698164206259	0.04047900925132404	0.26675760450798747	0.36430661861418334	0.462575923517919	0.5450728877703707	0.6513056318545286	0.8087544779435256	0.8598525215252286	0.9583183409344744	1.0976521277884104	2.3532733217173236	2.605987219927258	5.544175977617877	
This movie is just plain dumb.<br /><br />From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.<br /><br />Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.<br /><br />To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.	-7.701956472196113	-3.8614136438582243	-3.7932643175057077	-3.7552587707881293	-3.188526541257416	-1.9214676778540918	-0.8094230092010483	-0.7241489861322717	-0.6883836022396618	-0.5744367900329894	-0.44306523861935876	-0.32782846016000167	-0.21784871882890888	-0.1456036104862522	0.27631065556008594	0.4406484387547802	0.4957002815464676	0.7126297814135408	0.831880205396465	0.8748034313393831	0.875111716355183	1.3419320788651916	3.205941521170045	4.150905558319366	7.883317606453803	
I, for one, absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />It is not a "typical Asian horror" where you would see a gruesome looking ghost (usually a woman) that is going around scaring people. You barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius. This is not the movie for you if you're into gore (e.g. Saw, Hostel) or "surprise scares" where stuff pops out at you (Hollywood horror, slasher films), but this movie has an underlying "creepy" factor throughout the entire movie which I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by Hollywood in today's society.<br /><br />Please don't let the documentary-style of filming turn you off (why should it?!). It is far superior to the Blair Witch Project because, for one, the acting in Noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing.<br /><br />Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Only a few films have made it into my Top 5 horror; and this movie holds a solid #1 spot on my list.	-2.20195026018671	-2.0194608248259907	-1.7654310983978942	-1.4299867693715496	-1.4178254979504588	-0.9959606401267251	-0.5740201413105346	-0.4565768738331274	-0.4444947739037329	-0.4137764835710776	-0.37535340506200315	0.10960526976249843	0.3216800827299068	0.40855575203824235	0.4472038033405703	0.6045047040879832	0.6102312574641676	0.6397864800834996	1.057729520975545	1.15677407868179	1.3278473925455838	1.39646569826545	2.0437299415468964	2.6474460164916134	3.8373360507036933	
Even if you're a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. For once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! True to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. Yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema, dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and Philippe Bréjean (a/k/a "Gary Sandeur") contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore.<br /><br />Shot in and around a Paris office block before and after working hours, the film was largely cast with porn regulars Rollin was already quite familiar with from his "Michel Gentil" cash-gathering XXX efforts, most notably French f*ck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead. Playing Elisabeth (rather well, I might add), she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by Robert (Vincent Gardère), driving home at the end of a long work day. Barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur, even forgetting Robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. Prior to making love, she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to Brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. Because of this nifty bit of context, the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other "commercial" interludes Rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding.<br /><br />When Robert leaves for work, he's inevitably erased from Elisabeth's feeble mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant Solange (striking porn starlet Rachel Mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. Here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a/k/a hardcore performer "Cathy Stewart" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared "memories" for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. That deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and Catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It's also Catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges Elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them.<br /><br />Several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and French porn aficionados should recognize the likes of Alain Plumey (a/k/a "Cyril Val"), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess Marilyn Jess whose rape at the hands, mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES. The pivotal part of Véronique, a girl Elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with, is beautifully handled by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in Franco Zeffirelli's LA TRAVIATA. The six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined "patients" ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell, unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, approaching complete meltdown by now, and a wounded Robert stumble along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands.	-6.856639940208188	-3.784311620348017	-3.6481193651076795	-2.943854511601111	-2.567229639612897	-2.5384325496779288	-2.060314254505476	-1.3543245148809022	-0.8823651557870205	-0.5252028780492808	-0.48636720723205545	-0.26374526660915665	-0.17276257329126524	0.24143366013933437	0.684741567492092	0.9268101655648466	0.9702817948355732	1.253128536142803	1.343016090021042	1.4297134138048853	1.4833185627963283	1.9967371326997614	2.0348762484947964	4.41454647896806	8.937735137265356	
Admirably odd, though mean-spirited comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight. Some of the cinematography is evocative, Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as Bud Cort's vision of a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her!). In the lead, Bud Cort is--once again, after "Harold & Maude"--a true original; not off-putting like, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, wacky and inoffensive, a tough act to pull off. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's misfires. He can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else, but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward. ** from ****	-3.454638201273819	-1.5160496550990192	-1.5012565499304145	-1.4424003527326203	-1.2748269436592785	-0.8917272319433547	-0.777982856843922	-0.49362936361482107	-0.43114838071242	-0.41427629324670273	-0.2492413885412285	-0.13043830366095518	-0.10274685074615479	-0.07093248160155237	-0.03988726338394927	0.04046501801077969	0.2753037222967989	0.35094399615123073	0.38304624547417776	0.43248269684340357	0.46540953455824396	0.7270812243169569	1.3166923178734282	1.5164300011079899	3.7725848422398474	
Okay, now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from. I do believe they can be traced back to this movie. "Scene Of The Crime" feels more like a TV episode, or an episode of a serial. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.<br /><br />I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie dull as I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept tuning out when they were discussing the case ...something about bookies and informers. And oh yeah, there was a stripper, played by the previously wholesome Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: Why did she keep calling Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Wasn't Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What the heck does that have to do with anything? I guess I just don't get tough-guy Film Noir-ish kinda jargon.<br /><br />In fact, much of the dialogue made me mutter "nobody talks like that!" However, I could relate to one scene where the cop's wife (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time he goes to work, realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life. Yeah, I know that feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on them, that there's a constant fear for their safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self-consciously to be gritty and REAL, that it actually seems unreal to me.<br /><br />A little background: this movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer, and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to movies. I kinda hate Dore Schary. Maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious, bleak movies being made today, wallowing in the ugly "truths" about life, focusing on (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of humanity rather than the best. No longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II.<br /><br />Well, damn it, we still need that kind of distraction today! There's still plenty of depression and plenty of war. And what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape? Trashy, brain-deadening Reality TV. Thanks a lot, Dore!	-9.206273366235845	-4.914195702274994	-4.676530179584881	-4.0139011087207805	-3.0479001899188543	-2.839662437305986	-2.8325304941297222	-1.7415041668253295	-0.36204728010519527	-0.3315648144494266	-0.0834525735327718	0.233958998918324	0.29909937529860914	0.3164870460606025	0.5470357287238564	0.7225593567037972	0.9435466524170724	0.9479153875375024	1.2397902848952898	1.26258977034436	2.0914142564430453	2.170787261740394	2.716269412072461	5.257427607916303	10.654295793973876	
What can I say about this film other than "don't see it". I waited and waited and WAITED for someting (or anything) to happen and it just didn't come. Watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie. What are they doing? Are they solving a mystery? Are they gathering clues? Possibly, it's just hard to tell. At the end of the movie, after a lot of radio signals are decoded (illegibly on some sort of PET monitor) and this guy gives some lectures, the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible. Some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth (I guess they don't like sharing the wealth). My guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art (garbage!) and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film. Watch at your own peril, it's not even funny because it's so bad, it's just bad.	-4.767537027136748	-1.9559585705161866	-1.936394017240906	-1.766678736458463	-1.69834390356184	-1.0884797502336572	-0.908355058986195	-0.7366678508648438	-0.4185823783810348	-0.33981606090071453	-0.289694046204779	-0.0072737908912850965	0.013459199079495634	0.03928513679288295	0.048257731752433364	0.11103549829385538	0.29599352539482704	0.39393126486513463	0.6170568845856168	0.6276393910121256	0.7200048747785518	0.8485641273341044	1.6475175739423467	3.0169432849923523	4.769988556502486	
Like the Arabian Nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (It must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first.) Like the Arabian Nights it tries to cram as many Middle-Eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work. A freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ... I don't know why it all works, but it does. Everything is just so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is especially beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being Hungarian in a Persian way.	-3.444933212398027	-2.0136799871503483	-1.4264483401727162	-1.2921753077535543	-1.2351431996387252	-0.2507645834312704	-0.12748033908520234	-0.09421962522499724	0.07561429140572704	0.3829821733333452	0.39560289133039084	0.42719810994855606	0.4741309457949276	0.55922935167091	0.6095803428090203	0.8396107789932272	0.9388229697263735	1.0324652003407415	1.1086744232985946	1.2327379901684696	1.3140305320499068	1.6154272573482893	2.431113859165755	2.812866162715667	3.318313940129897	
Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror "Frailty", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as "The Greatest Game Ever Played." I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.<br /><br />The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U.S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />You know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.	-4.140667336684654	-2.646204417914994	-1.6000120968329266	-1.5627108226854027	-1.0386771534412758	-0.7062438981266757	-0.2105853125643471	-0.04668245577784989	0.2932371262601341	0.3139647579541054	0.4211850916957987	0.49482939891663424	0.5250233851239464	0.6396044210792495	0.7229656827996747	0.8051291048459221	0.9080433567265985	1.1675003305247782	1.2690436003866346	1.3096516596382948	1.604233913446913	1.8774099952451562	2.3562738317638363	2.6204930280818215	3.9001656970499265	
I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score.<br /><br />Either way it was a real disappointment. The movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: "Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?" And that's about it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone!). The acting is poor, and all people are unbelievable stereo types.<br /><br />To sum it up: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!	-5.745591558418001	-2.9617244593272876	-2.948198506883284	-2.5616959899601772	-2.4720058156588025	-2.450514768514053	-1.6424698729048977	-0.7051027123946862	-0.5759587262191608	-0.10529370391543963	-0.10263962204070026	-0.06456749467520279	-0.008305062584826661	0.09009058395558317	0.09089148257412887	0.2559812082618299	0.33074631616691874	0.35063246229241246	0.42816629954192564	0.8546721107363516	0.9328293825582831	0.9974064163541294	2.721581876744796	3.3578142405235187	6.208164137988525	
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.<br /><br />I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.<br /><br />Our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but I cannot figure out where that came from. His co-workers find out and tease him terribly.<br /><br />During the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course, else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist. He graduates eventually to actually killing, and that is what gets him caught.<br /><br />Like I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as Werner Pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.	-4.097823315619575	-2.0391814190232704	-1.800912806325547	-1.7134709311832927	-1.5921795083033876	-0.8952869554999378	-0.7479379771276137	-0.6017932965723337	-0.4519247830076527	-0.42931970009953674	-0.05172734982606283	0.00859724411796279	0.012798419704222234	0.038053829772955475	0.07077030066330303	0.07524388470687403	0.2049831322253924	0.47968750445265357	0.6182923695388359	0.7423422015008235	0.8314000164593705	0.8346594392555418	0.8473647868487648	2.060498682208274	4.20868578773986	
A message movie, but a rather good one. Outstanding cast, top to bottom. Interesting in that Bette Davis's plot line is essentially back story! The extremely negative reviews (name throwing at the screenplay/playwright, associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about 'Angles in America', etc. etc.) object to the movie being too preachy about Germany in WWII. Gosh, that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me.<br /><br />Theatrical and movie-making, and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way. Yes Casablanca is a better movie (I guess), but although made in the same year and both having Nazis in them, Casablanca is primarily a love story. The love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot--more of a thriller. Both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors. The children ARE a bit tedious and could have been edited	-2.2418287278760824	-1.961042236868144	-1.859845790564028	-1.0711247983499175	-0.7510572919681259	-0.6782351029140261	-0.6131859648150028	-0.5145408845919729	-0.47317866079058246	-0.4360134429726465	-0.22529557524718438	0.012213411328888923	0.07443183712338816	0.07725957114232294	0.10141479183599744	0.24319443985210784	0.5582266532023065	0.6905676058317873	0.7219507507702316	1.0342565309546268	1.8671660357104516	1.9034321773967227	2.0742803289659624	2.2331379065610846	2.600323452594377	
I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial. The commercial was great, but it I found out later that it had every explosion or 'special effect' in the entire movie (about 4) and even some that weren't in the movie. There was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as I remember. It was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people. I guess my world of innocence ended that day, when I found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies.	-2.9065384959870637	-1.283834962125194	-1.1933441229029178	-1.0921109382548806	-1.080704863719528	-1.017993288708381	-0.9095224121626576	-0.21697560698521715	-0.2035563662988349	-0.12000039331325263	-0.06514388062630264	-0.059619800451373814	-0.020659523930496776	0.033845209483784354	0.14636322473153968	0.15947907110942744	0.16537273800281632	0.19868042112126524	0.32884026807074385	0.35749535868593596	0.3739597163030855	0.4592754569645665	1.1272142719622522	1.5734092781464328	3.2006458177725214	
1956's The Man Who Knew Too Much is exceptional entertainment. To those who prefer the 1934 original, I will say that that one is faster paced and wittier. However, even though the American version was (heaven forbid!) a big budget blockbuster, I believe it blows the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock's 10 best-no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time. I find so many things to love:<br /><br />1)James Stewart, America's favorite everyman for so many years, does an excellent job playing the distressed father here. He can make any film enjoyable, and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story, he had me rooting for him very intensely. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison.<br /><br />2)Doris Day. Yes Doris Day. Despite all the criticisms directed toward her, I think she makes the loving wife/mother an extremely sympathetic person. I disagree with the negative remarks towards her character; just because she is soft-spoken and gentle it doesn't mean she is docile and helpless. I don't want to spoil anything, but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed. She gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first one, and for those who care about that this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think it is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and deservedly won its Oscar. It elevated the film to another level.<br /><br />3)The Albert Hall sequence. I don't think it was too long at all; I think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and Hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the assassin was truly frightening. <br /><br />4)The ending really put a smile on my face; even after the aforementioned scene was over I found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again. The last line in the film is highly amusing. I don't think the film started out slowly; Hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the McKennas and he did a great job. I wasn't a huge fan of the kid playing Hank, but I didn't have a problem with him. Since Hank was Ben and Jo's kid I cared about him too; it's not like he was a brat or anything. <br /><br />I found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues. Way to go Hitch!	-6.834554837577912	-5.39221381395391	-4.006883570587497	-2.8350508595440393	-1.8222714864114349	-1.317741283469721	-0.544812686390716	-0.24845475913951565	-0.2048603881821971	0.21446138390093647	0.23570657318157134	0.5614850157769624	0.9918324509609556	1.0407079870753695	1.099292648109894	1.1947378623473004	1.5586327826209394	2.1138459757565387	2.211989690008526	2.4094573732498215	2.8019871780200485	3.3976179679822027	5.180777981243865	5.7134814702731	6.624825960822935	
Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama. All the compositional devices Bach perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained applies to this film. There isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene I feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad. Mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but I feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders I wonder how this work would have ended? As it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.	-0.9609076672556429	-0.8713559244101127	-0.8439055495570043	-0.5765690328185548	-0.5239216332270268	-0.4883562561522659	-0.3465986907136683	-0.26929449625128526	-0.2594086921679779	-0.12453515415634056	-0.01731392268924746	-0.015137517630284477	0.12592176997765345	0.15058041843492465	0.15257621986055847	0.2291739648305285	0.25783612937094813	0.2708099479472146	0.35450603784674933	0.4434923253584373	0.8172667562711008	0.9081997632316702	1.136862928386329	1.1756658758049838	2.1799363420540514	
Mat Spirogolou's (Toby Malone) family know he is a talented footballer, and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him.<br /><br />But the cousins are like chalk and cheese: one a naive farm boy, the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters. Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day.<br /><br />Having missed his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on arrival in the city, Mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one.<br /><br />Toby Malone, probably better known for his work in theatre, puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager. There are telltale signs of a low budget, but as with so many other low-budget movies there's more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm, than there is to be seen in the average Hollywood blockbuster.	-1.1153829635105237	-1.1147995286079937	-0.9159623506347472	-0.6984603661886506	-0.6612209297020819	-0.3556876804574066	-0.34954677225639796	-0.3292488468100407	-0.32110831727361605	-0.11674278002196042	-0.06845075918895652	0.06423462320567264	0.12437628743424725	0.2244686158459845	0.2574343126991429	0.2786980544947527	0.34995520559374493	0.375761700814787	0.5002434806851486	0.5258083397148473	0.6498071373217823	0.69943037809214	1.170886965641732	1.1894321964580228	1.9121287002765501

From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), comes its even more preposterous (read goofier) sequel: right off the bat, we get another unwieldy "beginning of time" prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film!; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth! Faster than you can say "nepotism", Zeus (once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young Claudio Cassinelli) sends his champion  who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to, one presumes, the almighty tasks performed in the first film  to find his blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store.<br /><br />No sooner has Hercules (Lou Ferrigno  as if you didn't know) touched the earthly surface that he comes in contact with two attractive damsels (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) in need of his getting them out of distress!; the former (who would go on to become an Italian TV personality) seemingly has the ability to talk with the Little People(!)  which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964)!! Just so they can swindle as much unutilzed footage from the first film as is humanly possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrect good ol' King Minos (William Berger again) from his skeletal slumber and pit him once more against his eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a Gorgon  an awfully underproduced sequence which ought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film-makers behind the much superior CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) bothered to watch this flick (complete with the same "reflection in a shield" come-uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on his tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever he is)!! And just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve, Cozzi has Hercules and Minos turn into a cosmic version of "King Kong vs. Godzilla" for one of their battles and later still, King Kong gets to grips with a large snake, an encounter lifted straight out of the classic 1933 original. I swear it: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! <br /><br />As had been the case with the first film, the cast is full of old reliables like the afore-mentioned Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day) and up-and-coming starlets  not just Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (as a younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and, once again, Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily outcamps her appearance in the first film); for what it's worth, Pino Donaggio's score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in his soundtrack for the previous film. If you have stuck with this review so far, you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws. I'm sure I've left out some of its ineptitudes but I wouldn't forgive myself if I failed to mention the single greatest laugh-out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair (yes, it even surpassed the afore-mentioned animated titanic duel for me), namely the décor of the rebellious gods' lair which is in the shape of a giant marblekettle!!<br /><br />At this stage, one might well wonder why I gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not entirely unjustified) BOMB; in the past, I've had various protracted online discussions on whether one's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment value but these are two instances where I deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating. I don't know: maybe it's because I'm in a "sword-and-sandal" state-of-mind at the moment (with some 10 more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days!) but, after all, uncharacteristically for me, I decided to add these two films to my DVD collection simply based on the fun I had with them in this recent revisit  and that alone must count for something, no?	-9.729401811519972	-4.8658953368208	-4.365524738962519	-4.265542166060989	-4.035025384370229	-2.323392909688957	-2.144712237783396	-1.0382972412167142	-0.9720577896754155	-0.7920631226819889	-0.43814584450138633	-0.202350014702463	-0.16813456242966582	0.223623156679499	0.6136336142417854	0.8592034541918219	0.8618383242057989	0.9027179825494533	1.2524673035099398	1.2627388603344187	1.3817783152170648	1.474368194835899	3.6990440025654068	5.311402523058412	10.474150266039643	
I enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children. The faces of the actors are marvelous to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well. The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate. The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel. The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism, humanity, and history portrayed.	-3.3302894044054456	-2.760686824959174	-1.4634854161390491	-1.1739449486684708	-0.9416197190907427	-0.4140770442286429	-0.18140003847441077	-0.0244226455741062	0.2607340125623227	0.31798723254887173	0.37741192682142444	0.39103925406230544	0.4113590167396355	0.7323332059321142	0.8240547675807114	0.8561792924462651	0.908149951075573	0.9458422999256247	0.9532267014726878	1.195357593032209	1.2360262630938201	1.366674345571191	1.6831613443891404	1.9616721107867878	3.4701917368505244	
Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. If your thinking about watching this because your a Sandra Bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job, at least then we wouldn't have to listen to the terrible dialogue.	-4.023084482442928	-2.2549384194204087	-2.199358400137492	-1.9518012776255875	-1.6056824593015668	-1.442146319507637	-1.3263352422499317	-0.906652242065022	-0.6386141851062653	-0.39555438239077684	-0.15013468486510756	-0.13796073119245916	-0.03290798974417513	0.014619855273517012	0.09427783096091337	0.23726725443734106	0.2743595231725253	0.3588903940144036	0.36853664224256216	0.4553608304460577	0.5345778044610779	1.1059825930180407	1.539844229153756	2.1185641224919185	4.4891671450253305	
quote by Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: "Fine film, but DVD "reformatted for TV", 8 April 2002 - This is a charming and emotive film. On the other hand, the DVD I purchased has been "reformatted to fit your TV" by the clods at Columbia Tristar. There is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all films like the moronic, disposable trash that it is so used to producing. What a shame."<br /><br />What a (criminal!) shame indeed. However, there is another version out though.

I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. "It was so great," she said. "You really felt like you were on the ship." "Nonsense," I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, "you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested." "Well, maybe," thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. "OK," I thought, "I'll give it a look see." I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.<br /><br />Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost "you are there" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect "t" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of "My Heart Goes On."<br /><br />Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. <br /><br />A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.<br /><br />9/10	-10.848578758070055	-6.941411574844223	-6.000969146618195	-4.1072116144731865	-1.7708051932062352	-0.9944587768481208	-0.9750100143520315	-0.6005372536089264	-0.5949878785745529	-0.34260154043934726	-0.2004253851165582	-0.008056872008876254	0.37090356265044594	1.290665751469192	1.304649527960822	1.3631163931583268	1.7376760448843596	1.923503803762309	2.614964066726492	3.0019917745882143	3.244537499062908	5.978348580306034	7.256559169462498	9.42474515930536	9.437674886222835	
The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.<br /><br />It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I wouldn't bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.<br /><br />It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.<br /><br />If I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge "pleasure" from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic.	-2.6641685015161745	-2.4823746623207428	-2.479894402220149	-2.0638075132715503	-1.4055432108902453	-1.3113870085174435	-1.1652523476136776	-0.5410553343612181	-0.5233126325173529	-0.07188873799967518	0.03776711217445098	0.24782574514914366	0.30841150498511927	0.3115153704903276	0.5570441877634627	0.8881594526903909	1.0018262240414626	1.0990556070625148	1.3002466640622048	1.559168517715161	1.5729748209703507	1.6302258345266616	3.533375312932709	3.8382642671467875	5.051455765430454	
As Steven Segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel. His best was just fodder for bored teenagers. This one tips the scales, then falls off. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double lame. I can't spoil it by telling you the ending. You already know how all Steven Segal movies end if you have seen one. Here goes. He is a super-dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide, instead of killing him, to dope his brain until he don't remember squat. He escapes, of course, gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghanastan by a rogue Air Force pilot who, surprise, surprise, Segal trained. All the heroes, except Segal's character and his dusky girlfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby save the whole world in one swell foop, or fell swoop. Whatever. Made with some surplus Air Force and Navy flying film. And a lot of boom-booms. Get some Popeye cartoons instead.	-6.01229670772209	-2.970118431360366	-2.73638333573067	-2.3503731324356725	-2.3052274862200712	-1.7117254344376522	-1.5154584495525218	-0.8436781928142622	-0.4963523532826148	-0.3851467845893987	-0.277810884794122	-0.13155522604477873	0.22314825797048063	0.2276777465451878	0.3462732561073074	0.3468791181208973	0.6059424249056401	0.6838698990643696	0.7013948340700304	0.8786881732642107	0.9557977814815412	1.1985408195875218	2.455333287215992	3.1865615494768993	6.538940523932308	
Indian Directors have it tough, They have to compete with movies like "Laggan" where 11 henpecked,Castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots. "Devdas", a hapless, fedar- festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one's feelings or sentiments-alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry. But to make a good movie, you have to tight-rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit "Bollywood" leading actor who is marginally handsome. So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of Leonine village head who in own words "defending his Village" this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience. There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the Politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him, meanwhile his daughter is bathing his Grandson.This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India. Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in Hindi Films. The violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with Song&Dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won't sell, a sad but true state of affairs. Faster this changes better for "Bollywood". All said and done this is one good Movie.	-2.1696040586823484	-1.883483664942366	-1.8332972030893138	-1.5036449073873286	-0.7911685594172946	-0.7655522758560556	-0.7250831474244741	-0.44453602621038457	-0.3974162781277645	-0.2430005622775493	-0.18635415600671884	0.00946925839091381	0.09784156821349414	0.10404979338908132	0.13580147991054303	0.14981579913061185	0.4834653439088961	0.5515483648717766	0.719525902514343	0.7626986845263861	0.9501855563994369	1.010706031760632	1.5844336178977576	2.339691845390853	3.5986206871379856	
I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved; the acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound, and lighting. It also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie. Apparently back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million. Now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible. Apparently you can fly from the US to the middle east in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I didn't mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes. Oh yeah, since its a Steven Segal movie, its predictable as hell. All in all I rank it right up there with Snakes on a Plane.	-2.6867093906082204	-2.3446198024570837	-1.5904413735354461	-1.4088481003592244	-1.1814024840356827	-1.0619939332662658	-0.77354206121238	-0.46531819039104394	-0.4532275847849164	-0.25882178834251157	-0.14556105522712925	-0.09240053628624467	-0.07076582104916482	-0.02371685202621402	0.07151255947761526	0.07617544250202136	0.24024673625619478	0.35303391957522945	0.9054755998794765	0.9095199268609861	0.9123578599834543	0.9968461158673105	1.4824188803375642	2.7656559771010074	4.534558496315521	
I saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago. If you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves. It is a little like American Pie meets Fast Times at Ridgemont High but with more depth. It handles the same issues as both movies, but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth. The ending is sad, but that is how life is. I think everyone should see it. I have it on DVD form, and it took such a long time to find it too. That should say something, heh and another thing I will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack. I believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing. It has songs by artists like The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many more.	-2.426393986891498	-1.7760718895736731	-1.7241657662026215	-1.429880766974301	-1.0757536133072727	-0.6691121806241425	-0.5857687721764522	-0.4624090478817413	-0.3450330236015793	-0.18644784982080403	-0.08428726755505968	-0.036345784793621515	-0.010511838957588462	0.15444428828808282	0.16775138406982631	0.31287528350660404	0.4492498437872679	0.49557117268207623	0.5925447369626363	0.7519483584313333	0.8572674237058044	0.919187043202528	2.312994748491351	2.4693907514322633	3.7910707011139095	
"The Racketeer" stars Carol (deprived of the "e" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime kingpin Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines. At the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs. Done about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know Lombard and Armstrong had from watching their later movies. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  Vidor's "Hallelujah!," Mamoulian's "Applause," Wyler's "Hell's Heroes," Capra's "Ladies of Leisure"  all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically. Too bad Howard Higgin wasn't that strong; as it is, watching a naturally rapid-paced actor like Armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak, one can't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.	-4.559033983630424	-1.8396528558263312	-1.8295787706008007	-1.8049500436757482	-1.6340779234609042	-1.6295617920499732	-1.3936709270501013	-0.38455246982912483	-0.2892879229280537	-0.19262877251684518	-0.11806752467216387	-0.035644890984764255	-0.008132002602501992	0.12094531315822879	0.14453241261721275	0.1963512621187882	0.25468671149725763	0.2591335641792344	0.3809643418794003	0.40104720362367	0.43028534800583856	0.4856351549430078	2.301454994054242	2.55189458012949	4.891902221272515	
Cooley High is such a great film that even with the period's sound track, urban landscape, wardrobe and slang...it still doesn't feel dated. The sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself.<br /><br />Instead it absorbs you right into it. That is a staple of a good movie. From start to finish it doesn't miss a beat and I never grow tired of watching it.<br /><br />It's ending is unique in the respect that it's one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings. There may have been a few since (Backdraft comes to mind) but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.	-2.9233435295704897	-1.9388308198031239	-1.2617843386720269	-1.186513910702346	-0.9491594125670777	-0.12134787651227724	-0.017793007706027847	0.005270871920920725	0.05980900648675251	0.09346455927384073	0.3734214438890926	0.44114266667939206	0.5129069875479735	0.5481774278487179	0.6439151974691615	0.7950917290278272	0.8276320533293235	0.8545771451529456	0.9887124270318866	1.0175813650666647	1.4238867863624491	1.6582112114377796	1.7070889013665944	1.7517841187115384	2.9599934825797223	
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The End Times (which I find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense.<br /><br />As a film, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing was poor. The cinematography and direction were sub-par: no interesting visuals, no layered plot line, no creativity. Don't just blame it on the budget- films can still be interesting without special effects. This wasn't. Christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian."<br /><br />**Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is targeted towards Christians**<br /><br />First off, it is unethical in any business to bait-and-switch your customers. I don't like being told I can win a free iPod only to realize I have to spend $300 at participating stores first. Nonchristians don't like being told they're watching a Sci-Fi film and then get bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Hidden agendas don't win you any friends, much less converts. <br /><br />Secondly, you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true. The actors who represented Christians came off as callous, smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical "unbeliever"-- they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing. Representational dialogue: "Turn to Jesus- OR GO TO HELL!" "Fine, don't believe me- BUT YOU'LL BE SORRY!" "The day you die, I can guarantee you'll wish you paid more attention to this Jesus stuff- WHEN YOU LAND IN THE BELLY OF HELL!" OK, I may be exaggerating, but it certainly came off in the same manner. If you think this is a "clear message for Christ," you're wrong. I don't recall Jesus using threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. So Christians, please don't use this as a "witnessing tool" for your "unsaved" friends. It is heavy-handed, offensive, and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message.<br /><br />Thirdly, the theology was bad. Apart from characterizing Jesus as a means of hell-insurance, it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead, it offered one pat answer: "UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens," which is neither biblical nor widely-accepted by most Christians. As the Bible doesn't mention UFOs or aliens, you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. The rapture isn't necessarily even a widely-accepted, sound biblical concept, though nowadays most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. If you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting), the idea of two comings of Christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomena in Church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century. The majority of orthodox Christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions.<br /><br />Basically, this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I wouldn't recommend it.	-18.445180091113553	-7.603739269839511	-6.79157047703484	-6.414732663215345	-6.3661639060594055	-6.128227054619548	-5.913914138695736	-2.0812362725391	-0.7558425947093783	-0.30488117589817254	-0.11071261482867838	-0.106243948262479	0.22973633900205634	0.6132234060883754	0.615817919714967	0.7122674488336566	1.6721681560495205	2.0588577461525723	2.0735746675106537	2.4294405766728797	2.5372813583219216	3.22904709564643	8.461194869788088	9.32903688904607	20.645114786829822	
Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.<br /><br />Turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I've heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. The paranormal? It's real, just demonic, unless it takes place in a Christian context, then of course, it is of God. Simple, if it isn't of God, it's the of the Devil, stupid! So I suppose since Beethoven's 9th symphony wasn't inspired by God, it must have been written under demonic influence. Or so would the logic lead ad absurdum.<br /><br />We are informed that since the Bible does not tell of life on other planets in the Universe, therefore there is none (a version of the Ad Ignorantium fallacy) and that God created the Universe so huge, so grand to show us his almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan's remark that if God created such a huge Universe and stuck life only on Earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space.<br /><br />So what are UFOs? They are Demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking Christian event, the rupture...I mean Rapture. Before the tribulation, the true Christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane crashes...whatever. Therefore Satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event. All part of Satan's plan which will of course keep people from looking to God or Jesus and fall for the lies of the AntiChrist.<br /><br />This ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange, and the mysterious in as much as possible, first by the known, if not solely by the known.<br /><br />It's like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for. I think I'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away, gotten lost, or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or Satan or some such.<br /><br />This kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to Free Rock Concerts, that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt Christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. This kind of blatant deception one might think would be more Satan's ballgame. But maybe because the Christian faith is soon to be in its death throes, these guys feel that anything goes, any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like Islam, the world's fastest growing religion which may well replace Christianity, as Islam is far more cohesive and unified, and logically more tenable than Christian fundamentalism. Although this should offer little advantage to mankind, as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another.<br /><br />And of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of Pascal's wager. The atheistic Aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told. Well, if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worry...but what if you're wrong?<br /><br />Basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or Christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or Black and White fallacy. Even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make Christianity correct by default, nor if Christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default.<br /><br />For all we know, Native American spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the Earth and its creatures a wee bit better.<br /><br />This movie should be stamped right on the box: Caution: Contains religious Propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes.	-15.30438814176389	-6.46433784066778	-6.10772954412236	-5.71293376965062	-5.399008554158277	-4.168511537274516	-2.8224669150612613	-1.7585391160260184	-1.4829830383028049	-0.9853282468839837	-0.7434319749573504	-0.41959011441913713	0.39113673209591954	0.7799095488204546	1.1473856534738	1.3072861974130219	1.3222582925845898	1.468482306141122	1.5961678990767707	1.6283590749131946	1.7130368752864618	2.351586180552129	6.699920763656691	7.594311234319209	16.342200937823883	
I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine. I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.	-2.81533549255278	-1.276743616748472	-1.0725681811798922	-0.8604924175913843	-0.7273844454310393	-0.4435258422639751	-0.2301179828880897	-0.17635619562706922	-0.04109096546531554	0.017533749285754574	0.09158623345871958	0.25970743113597083	0.4246016071821956	0.5066304526651905	0.5413509272823116	0.8054897402842095	0.8617614172789478	0.874218774653407	0.8882282064930224	0.934359773889863	0.9533577322593935	1.3192751718947282	1.7623264914716896	2.6240306320242244	2.979053637115513	
Delivers great acting and greater Special Effects. Stars David Cronenberg, one of my personal favorites, as Decker. It's special effects on the monsters were so good, you thought they might be really deformed. Clive Barker, however demented, scored a perfect 10 on my list.	-1.7208399553365514	-0.5874334802762795	-0.5731625129911434	-0.4368974387673581	-0.36832764959810477	-0.2056927415477275	-0.17583374861694684	-0.12843993515155183	-0.10396158388002888	-0.026951056961062276	0.06815801287004955	0.1138267934714248	0.2751438021915023	0.3365024410882927	0.38949274314515936	0.40256102012744094	0.45036287460438307	0.5811689815624248	0.7784083070057075	0.7884384573261682	0.8020118650021821	0.8220218317918919	1.1431697582719211	1.3027855412677607	1.5716730696850685	
Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead Doug McClure, re-team in this ghost story set in Japan. They had been moderately successful together in the 1970's, with the likes of 'The Land that Time Forgot' (1975), 'At the Earth's Core' (1976) etc. Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though, the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way.<br /><br />The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th Century, with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide. A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place.<br /><br />No surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex (McClure) assuming the role of the wife's lover.<br /><br />Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion. Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'The Omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky Susan George. The first is a long 'Don't Look Now' inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; the second a much shorter (probably at her insistence) entanglement with McClure, both looking pretty uncomfortable. Anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost.<br /><br />Overall I can't decide whether 'The House where Evil Dwells' is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way. If you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort.<br /><br />BEST SCENE - in any other film the big, black, tree-climbing, Japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. They are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup. On seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to be told beef and vegetable, before uttering the immortal line "Ugh - there's an awful face in my soup". If this wasn't enough the reply is "C'mon, eat your soup for Daddy." Laurel & Hardy rest in piece.	-8.562911616513063	-3.8321938694755264	-3.271594707106261	-3.2560904273350553	-3.038649334455556	-2.650531358335435	-2.1085047981804905	-1.0913187710715575	-0.8701802196814044	-0.861820424894868	-0.47034904472023814	0.12109552930211963	0.15892038083730903	0.47344387493316936	0.5527630487707902	0.6094327705354037	0.6780631450958927	0.8207252411829769	0.8676116796389022	0.9839900560043042	1.267416318099377	1.370897012988058	3.3781486764802886	4.231743682185179	8.8341812201635	
For months I've been hearing about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase, "It's Animal House meets Back to the Future"; "It's Wall Street meets Dead Poet's Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable.	-0.9869367163592149	-0.9263082062339851	-0.8022609258478197	-0.5701544474954388	-0.4782750708787367	-0.4752357194164039	-0.2011879090077954	-0.19873775519122006	-0.10907642410068355	-0.04332237104493097	-0.02036101329477751	0.08396524341060155	0.09622157979028431	0.15377656906677525	0.15834963050083034	0.19162153870328036	0.2457676125466858	0.27198262923445615	0.30610225787139306	0.3241165075588514	0.39712993494547044	0.683201644086682	0.8857367444746116	1.3390043171652064	2.083338219401911	
This piece ain't really worth a comment.. It's simply the worst "horror" movie i have ever seen. The actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry.

Notable only as the acting debut of future big-time Hollywood starlet, Sandra Bullock, this ludicrous action flick is so full of holes that one might easily suspect termite infestation. The storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. The production values stink of cheese. In fact, a total LACK of production values would have been better...at least the film might have seemed grittier that way. The ADR is laughably bad and omni-present in the film. It's debatable as to whether or not ANY of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were used.<br /><br />The performances are, for the most part, horrible, though there are a few exceptions. In those exceptions, however, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times. (i.e. characters going from passive to panicked in the blink of an eye. Bad Direction.) Also, the constant "weapon sound effects" (magazines being loaded, slides being cocked, etc.) are completely overused and, more often than not, totally out of sync with the on-screen actions. Add to this cheesy "Bad Guy" vocal distortion for the lead villain (mainly so that you KNOW he's the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film), and you have a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />The situations in the film go well beyond standard "suspension of disbelief" and become downright laughable. One lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he DECIDES to use the butterfly knife tucked in his sock in order to free himself. So, my questions are...why didn't he do this sooner, and why does he even HAVE the butterfly knife. He wasn't searched? RIGHT. This is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been crammed into this 90-minute package.<br /><br />In whole, "The Hangmen" plays like an unbearably bad R-rated TV movie from the '80s. If not for the subsequent success of Sandra Bullock, this would have NEVER found its way to DVD. But it has, so my only advice is to steer clear. Watching this film may actually impair your IQ.	-12.374242139383847	-5.604674299057541	-5.330475164826595	-5.181971934520199	-4.928353559219081	-3.511408052628861	-2.4218965207206526	-1.3473190649676021	-0.8893052829892174	-0.7188605311680365	-0.5651813803841781	-0.42566640206861334	-0.2430804103520248	0.010340586308516198	0.31590249892088246	0.6019218140294729	0.7380595120261051	0.9785384046279738	1.148677270138687	1.2175931148531853	1.9038641466155446	1.9145495483377064	5.827252958921445	6.016675660944831	12.663478492373434	
"Death Wish 3" is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery. All the characters (apart from Bronson's Paul Kersey, of course) exist merely to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "retribution" (the villains). The director simply pours on the mindless violence (people even get burned alive and blown up), turning this into an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire). Fans of this short of thing (and, apparently, there are many) will enjoy it, others....beware.

It is interesting to see what people think of this movie, since it is, in fact, quite unique (though it bears some of the trademarks of Clive Barker's writing). Even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so, the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard Hollywood plot hooks, and layered, so that if you expect to be fed, you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot.<br /><br />Those who need a linear, specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie, because the story lies, like in the novella, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially off screen, in comments and the imagination.<br /><br />Another possible hang-up is the ending, of which I can say, without spoiling it, that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad. It is, in fact, not very defined at all, which I know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened, but to me, and to many others, I'm sure, just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation, and, in addition, the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far.<br /><br />There is definitely moral here, but of a rather different kind than the standard Hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie sort of display. Summing that moral up is simple, even though it is not quite that simply displayed; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.<br /><br />I love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky. I'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie, provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.	-3.432993977631092	-2.7487951808520665	-2.247543225730564	-2.1320986296994455	-2.1110222475453986	-1.54807949026951	-0.9162343541349084	-0.8964188155138534	-0.21274007529652078	-0.07496024069969974	-0.049393223260402866	-0.03995193405595249	0.2197250138725332	0.325014847905142	0.38367374742415244	0.38814211243341995	0.40247159242095115	0.41902626429789896	0.5317682456348864	0.5676777426495788	1.014250691041981	1.454670046732646	1.6354832403431308	3.1234701811977312	5.1818082970781525	
This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen. The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. The casts is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before, ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. My one complaint, I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other then that I think they did a great job. The dialog, the characters and the story was perfect. The acting was wonderful. This has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. You heard me, the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.	-5.180124926631963	-4.263051078189313	-2.241915759513608	-1.4875106644716722	-1.3731160533309048	-0.8105523828361274	-0.15966800549224328	-0.0854488818098224	0.10021796787194318	0.3780896283447033	0.6966959043839738	0.887613643509674	1.0922676870869517	1.1208217667435068	1.368463514449576	1.4521436466202835	1.4763870406534385	1.605986373802778	1.6532565737033833	2.0549186662351766	2.126264398115443	2.3336173906584303	3.156283923671571	3.3964908831563907	5.348855809186182	
Naked Deanna Troi! <br /><br />Richie's brother Chuck (from "Happy Days") with a reverse mohawk!<br /><br />Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including one clever scene where Chuck Bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window.<br /><br />Chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away.<br /><br />All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it is one of most incomprehensible "serious" movies that I have ever seen--loaded to the hilt with mayhem, and nearly zero police response, despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score.<br /><br />As I understand it, Bronson disowned this film, but happily cashed the check from Golan Globus.<br /><br />If you enjoy quality movies, avoid this one, but if you're in for a cheap "Jackass" kind of thrill, check it out.	-2.2404171489554257	-1.8358376228211126	-1.18283085455985	-1.0167724213887532	-0.8932307410366898	-0.5535369922933742	-0.49430205734509763	-0.48164056875187644	-0.42603164694786183	-0.39852380843342794	-0.1578869130416966	-0.1116125151382254	-0.05412486597569234	-0.04792224615604146	0.03939698402599805	0.19637979064157093	0.20703240125014208	0.40074460179570437	0.6583000942671565	0.6659538010268685	0.7438575814000271	1.109497848163022	1.159671810930618	1.678766033608869	2.5706728057860446	
Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn't be ignored. I'm reminded of the episode of Michael Moore's brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere (a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film). Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie. He's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague. You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freeman's massive talent as an actor. He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers (as well as the viewers of this movie) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life. I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. There are a lot of people in the world (maybe more than our share in America) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.<br /><br />One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion. I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live. But despite the fact that I don't believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.<br /><br />Jim Carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come. If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura (both of which I loved, by the way) or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it's amazing how far he's come. He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic (easily one of his greatest films ever). Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie (as she did in the side-splitting Office Space) as Bruce's girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him. There is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura's friend Spike make a cameo appearance. As Stephen King very well knows, it's always nice to see familiar characters. It's almost like seeing family again.<br /><br />Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him. The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers. The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.<br /><br />The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene (who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records), the scene where Bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking. The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God (who reveals that he's the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc) that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home! I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law.<br /><br />Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection. It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie (which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy), it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. Don't miss this one.	-9.13125271211653	-9.021559397558445	-5.901238261874972	-4.936908509105333	-3.4814342517632255	-1.1778423393622597	-0.6903271149208391	-0.5766034429326373	0.4194308570239518	0.5376935259080593	0.5679518373799182	0.857776568668333	1.011761936845901	1.0555577956186895	1.7855138714296852	2.2449978336131795	2.682761419753443	2.9834326919379435	3.1863015188374004	3.5762573560094966	3.800753967576747	4.257556911769613	8.933513042962492	11.068647968845296	11.345113437413897	
This is the Who at their most powerful. Although before the masterwork Who's Next, which would provide anthems like Baba O'reily and Wont Get Fooled Again.

Are you kidding me? This is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical. When I herd about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. But this movie just destroyed that. Ric White (Director, Writer, Lead Actor, etc) takes himself a bit too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves....Do yourself a favor....skip this one.	-3.722748037733978	-2.1317463625771893	-2.0209126192237776	-2.018836503488159	-1.9781712453594116	-1.164729639282671	-0.9587292182318548	-0.8268866010086774	-0.6396529184646287	-0.3252930490176319	-0.2621058628531966	-0.24442631568164325	-0.17092571958361344	0.0281136092740841	0.12668523871933113	0.15089877598413276	0.25165129585031587	0.5770159650142535	0.5808553909135151	0.7211862657521136	0.8224213319119239	0.9051049025457716	1.826329461418844	2.442963321399463	3.927029341368236	
I had some expectation for the movie, since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /><br />When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well, the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.<br /><br />The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.<br /><br />Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10.<br /><br />Guys, please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes.<br /><br />Thats all.	-5.187784792281818	-3.027824254746396	-2.5377841879950234	-1.9979948485651267	-1.5992728750027705	-1.4087688089544712	-0.7742026587337296	-0.6069059827965985	-0.5909335997996035	-0.5393010225685185	-0.11239119787353041	-0.004095538770168834	0.06588016116703943	0.13542853959863538	0.3930892454146648	0.4027670189566691	0.5251188911948412	0.6731446640012584	0.8764926764426234	0.9790810082494877	1.0497272675528269	1.3967624294603724	1.4163927342464788	3.0240536648373046	6.100963757571606	
Supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels overly long at 80 minutes. Years ago, a bunch of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned up in a forest fire. Years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire. A bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own. Despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (Jackson Bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way. Before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. No surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates, leaving the "final girl" to fend for herself, although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement, the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster.<br /><br />The story itself couldn't hold the weight of feature length, so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release. On the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice. Also among the highlights are Bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death sequence, OK gore, and the Great Jackie Coogan in his final film role, as the bumbling local sheriff. This is a far cry from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. This is for slasher completists only.	-4.56613565177374	-2.484806876984014	-2.0860920778681633	-2.053448127719213	-1.7102698973373531	-1.51097491296579	-1.443458121618633	-0.6537079040268575	-0.6044246551185437	-0.39025932931330104	-0.318412672755686	-0.17408643024685183	-0.015859001079500584	0.08513853203020731	0.10671037786895218	0.4545497733759526	0.5262823823106842	0.6222461868371798	0.6414786055175381	0.7168373881073147	0.9631460106648652	1.2379554248598852	1.4992633585975539	2.7031732400680135	5.542245985334237	
my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago. and, i must say, this is the single best movie i have ever seen. i mean, woah! "dude, we better get some brew before this joint closes" and "dude, linda's not wearin' a bra again." what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderfuly original movie, too. i mean, you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same. i mean, exactly! now that's originality. and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close-ups of the psycho in the ER scrubs. how cool! the acting is so wonderful to. the dad was just brilliant. must have studied REAL DADS before filming. and how many movies do you find that just don't make any sense? not many. but this is one of those gems. i mean, how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank, while his friends were both inside? that's really cool. overall i'd say this is the single greatest film of the genre, nay, in the world! *****	-5.728063519550721	-3.600806064355038	-2.6001344404425475	-1.950982603919583	-1.2374111259046916	-0.3779638604384207	-0.25930856755138787	-0.22743459926933773	-0.1839461267254117	-0.10974421367753724	-0.01595158623600486	0.03537627249897596	0.16767686413988597	0.25103355103454056	0.25645360180815524	0.4350474384408474	0.7026593430447556	0.8333308223297813	1.0996433499258031	1.3618210132840032	1.4362176652431655	1.8065102135284348	3.556513963319375	4.723057550559038	4.893446467909428

I first saw this film two years ago in the cinema, and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step-mother. Their relationship with their step-mother is strained to say the least, with the step-mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror, which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear, but is all the more intriguing.<br /><br />The direction is incredibly good, and the acting is stunning, with the step-mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. The large house adds eeriness, and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. You simply don't get anything like this in the Western World, sadly,and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade.<br /><br />Highly recommended viewing in my opinion, a real joy and scare...	-2.8243177008297438	-2.0065435917995726	-1.8277862187263738	-1.4386965179430156	-1.2200278847982007	-0.7544571786788437	-0.3785614212781111	-0.10731262413779934	-0.09412907865682708	0.03933347591129038	0.184785684227526	0.2950504908986562	0.4193043589952078	0.433279891745324	0.5072109370841823	0.6434298463233952	0.6645639883164218	1.1398744713749784	1.2766980866191247	1.368968958823853	1.423066736836832	1.6150983360067606	2.6200223970533707	2.9226636414897316	3.3988004189405845	
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. But since it featured Sandra Bullock, who I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateurish. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice, dead people moved their legs. When my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and joyfully complied. This is an amazingly bad movie. Tomorrow I am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant Christmas party.	-5.673674951588701	-2.3989139922566096	-2.378843419233915	-2.228689382612054	-2.0334317087764946	-1.8876658422717194	-1.7216565772994339	-0.45165156407704976	-0.3325144074102964	-0.2293587058794431	-0.1555470190874419	-0.11050321775743223	0.015919853865730083	0.11506990306752288	0.1411834351557738	0.2066072819380553	0.5357402551577507	0.6276740472114521	0.9248400771573408	1.0104512576515405	1.1100728599280396	1.1570529916228112	2.5801846254382768	2.948107552135768	6.14602116932161	
I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college and I still can't get it out of my head, although I have never seen it since. I remember every cast member (the casting WAS perfect, as mentioned in other comments), the design, the lighting and, of course, the story, which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set. Probably the best TV series I ever saw next to the original "Roots."	-1.2110008578573985	-0.5078060772126343	-0.4676456668183146	-0.35908895762583815	-0.3164940932562957	-0.22534624336762243	-0.17754343968791939	-0.16281976663650694	-0.13711534886675691	-0.06891197672731195	-0.008280493367338722	0.1704424926846812	0.1745667989497015	0.2082257571506061	0.2930501258504977	0.29368780428669883	0.33048146519773297	0.36355639086834446	0.5315599663391719	0.5503214378678968	0.7024414372540079	0.7272699217771719	0.7854551389698032	0.9897648201171653	1.0075527709779737	
Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying "Ne boltay!", meaning "Don't gossip!". I "translated" it for the "generation" of TV watchers as "Don't be Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the nosy neighbor on "Bewitched").<br /><br />However, when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see that it's not quite a laughing matter. In this case, the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States. So, he tells it to someone, who tells someone else, who tells someone else, and it continues. As in "The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming", the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time, so that when it gets back to Snafu...well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mostly WWII propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I have to say that the Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually quite funny. Of course, since they had Dr. Seuss writing and Mel Blanc providing the voices, it's no surprise that these came out rather cool. Worth seeing.	-4.519217379883348	-2.7585721501035665	-1.9695801972751599	-1.669592267362178	-1.2444695289460292	-0.8885334692148086	-0.8731070282367561	-0.7974635064886448	-0.29850760150306854	-0.1628579475160429	-0.035287367586868984	-0.021798589494103293	0.052043024658125096	0.15653631403048024	0.18067792237345098	0.2216771033280167	0.3277922613250926	0.34650290959799873	0.6543206442255955	0.7838490724367886	0.8251987388840301	1.1083876622440707	1.8236207796960935	2.292576621954186	4.629031865727841	
Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat, selling out his boss, and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently "I'm a lawyer" he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site, are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often).	-3.5826802796465924	-2.2240304301328977	-2.2228639717470156	-1.4374471221007419	-1.0469009885150489	-0.7013168523209307	-0.5053766047480682	-0.4845804142148921	-0.22008622270523093	-0.15387754623611521	0.3696827379138205	0.6127957393225307	0.6316038240593577	0.6586336033613773	0.7803352013419532	0.9123267473305974	1.025634756234608	1.1784910814719107	1.2997029575713095	1.3556832595063413	1.7446763480182779	1.9600647105647448	2.1785108198695697	2.3549477433014214	3.4058265209212926	
People forget that there have been several King Kong ripoffs- Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all ripoff one another, but YETI stands on its own. It only borrows one element from King Kong and that is the animal's attraction with one female.<br /><br />The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong)and archeologists have been fascinated it, at one time they did exist,but there is no scientific data to prove it.<br /><br />This movie is hard to find ,but its worth watching it. The first time I watched it was on "Elvira's Mistress of the Dark Shows" in the early 1980's. It sent chills down my spine as a kid, especially when the YETI got mad. I saw it again, around 1:00am on ABC about 2 to 3yrs ago. Seeing it again made me appreciate it more, it has some overall good effects (for its time) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog, and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes. Also the music is pretty cool,its very YETI like. :-)<br /><br />Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere.<br /><br />Vote 7 and half out of 10.	-3.4744777432553606	-2.1441297499758893	-1.5058198435481003	-1.1990286476035488	-0.9510244794729734	-0.9261785668637302	-0.8652669981372689	-0.4659314499190379	-0.3351892731448459	-0.28845635576989787	-0.27180607672583257	-0.20386793166851574	-0.036805437085487475	0.18642868807452537	0.2938522957297899	0.3202129129492703	0.34365038787383495	0.5331690577044188	0.6352195464443753	0.723258972471984	0.7380024792500068	0.7529367054172077	1.2418832798569064	2.1003909185353336	4.171175862498075	
WAIT until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.<br /><br />I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be odd.<br /><br />Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent did sneak through. Ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film.<br /><br />The DVD I rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio section that only featured Sandra's bio - taken verbatim from IMDb. It also had a Trivia Quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. Hope you get them all right!	-3.2485476883210684	-1.9323270068509022	-1.370066735543129	-1.256357631007459	-1.2562580072018923	-0.6686590828986647	-0.6363113233690167	-0.5675961523321906	-0.49579815352519263	-0.437370956480319	-0.3125226405698234	-0.17562299631754863	0.13638898986966577	0.2020204543122235	0.27728984746353186	0.33009088516652696	0.34085434516235763	0.617149528228231	0.6297675111389518	0.6560604352806055	0.883138592575285	1.1150304122491927	1.1164936117581101	1.8835386555133078	3.145552565482361	
This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle.<br /><br />The Original Drum and Bass.<br /><br />There seems to be very little early Who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be 'aving it, now-a-days it tends to be of a very different kind of Who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. To be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they've earned their respect and with overtime.<br /><br />This concert footage for me is one of their best. To command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music.<br /><br />We all know of the other acts on the bill, The Doors (their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point being that whoever were there it was The Who that the majority had come to see. This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960's; Woodstock. The film and record had come out and so had The Who's greatest work to date, Tommy. The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to "Grove and Love" in the knowledge that this gig was their own. To do this you needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd.<br /><br />At two 'o clock in the morning in late August 1970 the M.C. announces, "Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock 'n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the 'OO".<br /><br />John Entwistle's body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel's and long flowing hair, Keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, as Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins that he'd preferred to wear.<br /><br />The Who never stopped their onslaught of High Energy Rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists' greatest tracks such as Young Man Blues, Shaking' all Over, and then as on queue, Keith baiting the crowed to "Shut up, it's a bleeding Opera" with Tommy, the Rock Opera. The crowed went wild. This is what they had come to hear, and the Who didn't disappoint, straight into Overture and never coming up for air until the final note of "Tommy can you Hear me?" Amazing.<br /><br />To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a Festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the World was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History.<br /><br />The English DVD only comes in a soundtrack of English/Linear PCM Stereo, were as in the States, I think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, "Check local press for details" on that, okay.<br /><br />The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival History this DVD would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best Who concert footage as it was meant to be, Live, Raw and in your Face!<br /><br />I would have given this DVD ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice.<br /><br />Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith.	-7.041064102261371	-5.243443925961091	-4.7488203832580895	-3.585500854387732	-3.5344328512023258	-2.564592063283466	-1.368302002655242	-1.093229061449955	-0.8146718843460803	-0.6359262092462812	-0.3794531343076858	0.05985882011095345	0.08806564433538877	0.24787244741158493	0.3108042778803102	0.37857337696823584	1.1511160703163454	1.4226108448814176	1.5175388078419352	1.6029756405488622	1.7283795786386709	2.549235583314752	2.7333761925525657	5.5559748598647625	9.515589222284515	
The ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! Director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner table' scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE'...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.<br /><br />Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.<br /><br />The movie is long but it's fantastic!!! Good story, good flow, good actors!!! Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!	-4.0928199620864305	-2.4750846999478044	-1.995944697385916	-1.0273305132205632	-0.9576334745747592	-0.4668958537385869	-0.19646864996186966	-0.09754006484343851	-0.04791417020706389	0.09597532869136438	0.5838749445365659	0.7293325815685686	0.7816179512291795	0.8810195748099852	0.8858387390303173	1.0247249768853053	1.0582142745855188	1.0793253118642137	1.4774657229560577	1.6334895716114612	1.6772071246191373	1.8052250909866165	2.3315004368674535	2.647644777222479	4.284980131583164	
I got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on DVD and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. It now may not have Richard Dean Anderson now but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons. Sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to DVD movie and hopefully more. Atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons. And there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead. This TV show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people Watch IT !!!!! 10/10	-1.5136529220457347	-1.3040004576949575	-0.8414898555849143	-0.5354287917882545	-0.37864055057584695	-0.11608854059696769	-0.03777697629482886	0.010647500734430018	0.08566900588958012	0.08791346501270046	0.1855968470639064	0.2602554625869692	0.26084875138953306	0.26725346100886144	0.27067019377572826	0.3102011425158023	0.33220046363420946	0.3516755931033324	0.3826611564731819	0.5178156872788388	0.5666128002499252	0.8120705414336657	0.9492181294860111	1.5837669492308677	1.8429355400046885	
If you speak French or can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. If on the other hand you just want to see God's most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. Not an ounce of silicon in sight. Zalman King eat your heart out. Sophie Marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything I had ever fantasized about. Her part is even in English. Even the fact that she was nude with John Malkovich did not detract for her beauty. Sophie is a ten if ever there was one. Chiara Caselli and Inés Sastre are 9.5s. Oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. Several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of Six Degrees of Separation style.	-1.980825232957296	-1.569278074358597	-1.290897316999607	-0.7401135943007832	-0.35426030909296197	-0.23699695421403458	-0.21284281960184298	-0.0780089647039072	0.17452124039281286	0.18014579247596169	0.19285634492179118	0.27552238491244285	0.3193300539642114	0.3612181427403419	0.3662122173188709	0.4204396965538883	0.4608521734679972	0.5884406651077019	0.6107123686477596	0.6636251056577152	0.7436394231579135	1.0801543612779847	1.2749044227806638	2.0494322169325505	2.7271718579425057	
This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound. It's a long trip, which drags in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen. And the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all.<br /><br />I discovered this movie playing on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. That'll learn me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep in.	-4.766489700623988	-4.412930687408752	-2.6990886201833786	-2.295957710501432	-1.9790268390862842	-1.2975544972719286	-0.7086414080237939	-0.22997476713879106	-0.15989419061661425	-0.15641455271648844	-0.007042173376051848	0.03906183050905096	0.202688942680481	0.442727210457869	0.6097816790861368	0.6316589811451924	0.7051348445801405	0.9133804783736589	0.9355569249802017	1.195830524635816	1.2418114837668939	1.243947748046438	3.4432364898380694	3.5110323193988098	6.878534271642222	
This is a really old fashion charming movie. The locations are great and the situation is one of those old time Preston sturgess movies. Fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it. The acting is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was in Rounders, too. And While You Were Sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. It's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings. I know... sounds kooky... but it is. And that's what makes it fun to watch. It will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you, but at least you'll know.	-3.7664018795695235	-3.618747187119241	-1.426726393860211	-1.171138737440607	-0.9472821437194393	-0.4050652174775723	-0.27245412396913643	-0.16209312787608227	-0.11299364276600593	0.3008004885880295	0.33648205259758956	0.41355875391440167	0.879323762937375	0.9818580862845434	1.0377704742743818	1.0816061719298613	1.155235235187593	1.1876677230532378	1.4020091790535645	1.5215309605749405	1.691293978769828	1.9887894139695548	2.2066168781337328	2.4109326005069898	3.8427962198954275	
This film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast. Glynn Turman, (Preach Jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs, (Cochise Morris) was an outstanding athlete at the Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship to a famous college. There are scenes in this picture with the Chicago Police Department chasing all these dudes in a Cadillac and a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo with monkey dung being thrown around. The music is outstanding and there is great photography around the City of Chicago. Great Film, enjoy.	-3.130789662288481	-1.8982679481350828	-1.1930838420528622	-1.0051958792310738	-0.7493809033762642	-0.17214244825009647	-0.007957557021745512	0.13958696627998457	0.14058524668997227	0.23765556881416303	0.31167708808853983	0.6723514647928561	0.8779795101746215	0.881368229630789	0.9619829624135967	1.0018942931939263	1.0615464579342373	1.196005819848176	1.259854355674442	1.5800669590587455	1.620734604298697	1.9179196768451179	2.0568170128067442	2.3616122882865134	3.4053829694614706	
I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's "The Lurking Fear" that was shot in Louisiana. Outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own "twist" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. Either way, it is a much better adaptation than Full Moon's THE LURKING FEAR. Too bad it is a terrible film. Director David McCormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short. I swear I counted maybe two camera movements. The creature design is cheap (we're talking store bought masks here) but shot in a dark manner (intentional or not) where they are somewhat creepy. The most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but McCormick fails to exploit that as well. File this one under good adaptation, poor execution.	-4.2320634145908285	-1.9540469969958316	-1.8780631302014499	-1.714816199880437	-1.714043465824774	-1.4155863671377835	-1.3376007847258473	-0.5302617213528154	-0.49850217427197474	-0.28825160288364926	-0.24650395879765935	-0.14672138814653618	-0.05015505239018733	0.03771526960004006	0.11639822060294064	0.15592074134220657	0.18638781380741487	0.220219375784952	0.3776287042285012	0.5067377743836633	0.626339069219115	0.9151528996471492	1.2015006709015617	2.34387168932599	4.752504842442995	
I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, I seriously don't think that Isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. I have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. I also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and I'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not. I'm trying to find the "original" story that it was based on, to compare facts, but I can't seem to find anything about it online.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. Special effects wise, the movie wasn't bad for a Grade B, pretty much, and those possession scenes made it all worth while... that is, if you have nothing better to do.

I personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating's some people have given it. It is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated, now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me. Though, if you are a fan of Interesting, strong characters and heroic(sexy) women kicking butt and saving the world(hell) you will love this movie. I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie. Quite anime-esque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. meet's the live action version of Punisher. In the end I highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie.	-2.967042686049824	-2.302196392124372	-1.020996951392007	-0.8668366183976317	-0.7988464935562932	-0.23488353803201267	-0.21024254880586934	-0.1976473755442943	0.12043078168872409	0.2376529295049588	0.2403778859222423	0.25824385990024235	0.28539840541133804	0.2866375983644549	0.3324950535687756	0.3851268627479031	0.48643631043751784	0.514442329211217	0.7477948053421577	0.9788017218376772	1.0882674706300133	1.5127129145157725	1.7381158035274313	1.9900698181413965	2.480289238211687	
Unique movie about confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with sharp con men. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-caliber performance as the slickest of the group. Absolutely enchanting first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse "the ropes" of his con games. Story line unravels a bit later on, but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world. Definitely worth a shot.	-2.8505176380963335	-1.6079562267308336	-1.0376894819261728	-0.5410283738436584	-0.42814971074230584	-0.18552115467793842	-0.18547232256793236	-0.17575566657377512	-0.11054992742836911	0.1000272300646281	0.2926364000839367	0.3547547097474557	0.49796691447244223	0.5383291052034891	0.5780234532296179	0.5891253512956329	0.6376168508128675	0.8089866741317616	0.8360410510865512	1.0119720108009578	1.014611240779687	1.0589673373762332	1.1713974459696437	2.2987309667798894	2.5171208171403037	
This is easily my favourite film. A tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel at the end in one fantastic rush. Sheer brilliance.<br /><br />I'd love to see some more of Gilles Mimouni's work, but at least according to imdb, he hasn't made any other features. Has the high quality of this work made producing another too daunting a task? Has he moved (back) into some other sphere of creative endeavour? I certainly hope this won't be his final feature but I can't really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films.	-1.8191252765894004	-1.0192775362377549	-0.9856258474800155	-0.922259048440718	-0.4712761512951541	-0.3748626038072363	-0.1391034888105972	-0.0381415291032486	-0.024150941279044824	-0.009091561269470833	-0.0022947005413291033	0.02997523297251395	0.15702826156963265	0.2509082295597187	0.29106742154108756	0.3096569000644914	0.3197059380326581	0.39188907517404326	0.5287653005183561	0.6579856985002636	0.8737733253036781	0.8872022510062609	1.372656645520191	1.8897881343753198	1.9067002697980322	
This movie should be retitled: Sex in the 70s In a Part of New York City called Greenwich Village and Chelsea.<br /><br />This movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the hypersexual environments of public and private sex spaces in New York City. I doubt that the Manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the time period looks like a blast. And it's rather important to document the scene to which the film refers. But as far as calling this film Sex in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. Technically it's no Oscar Nominee, but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject.<br /><br />Overall, an "eh."	-2.870248108008541	-1.7573612009129804	-1.160697634385908	-0.8928437228313338	-0.8196136371004158	-0.6949963130429876	-0.6465736338257826	-0.5323672454508812	-0.45052290281439256	-0.27869747386835514	-0.1736652225570135	-0.14705368986429926	-0.06977138850081135	-0.014135709821227402	0.36255296688362265	0.4315711751822937	0.4580307298598991	0.4671252942579415	0.49702028167654644	0.6059848541350876	0.6715787262488381	0.6880578040009829	0.713346507902152	1.7199029794696126	3.0395193685222983	
Although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, I saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days. what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a "shy" boy fantasizing about "kissing" his dream girl, no offense but if that was an American movie, you would certainly see-at a certain point, mainly climax- the "shy" boy "making love" to his girl, and i really can't grasp this contradicting concepts till now...i have a simple request ,if anyone knows how to get this movie on a DVD by mail ,please let me know cause i need a shot of memories..Thanks	-1.3660001689176529	-0.9594157555738654	-0.6848552103085984	-0.6518587255929835	-0.527693465142188	-0.5074302648650739	-0.427557132675918	-0.42497918794296186	-0.3973273417315018	-0.3462529955063446	-0.22385288886556587	-0.14026019548048035	-0.062480458622011126	-0.05037155651368955	0.00753241033360913	0.060043828539560154	0.10858517304556566	0.1270218095721974	0.16202046495323877	0.22371359090919019	0.33045387440038054	0.6493699502236296	0.7317868646476771	0.788798394010881	0.9033926469461449	
In this first episode of Friends, we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series: Monica Geller,Phoebe Buffay,Chandler Bing,Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and eventually Rachel Green .<br /><br />We discover that Rachel, a rich girl that is Monica's friend from high school times, left her fiancé, Barry, at the altar, since she discovered she didn't love him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent from her father,getting a new job as a waitress in Central Perk.<br /><br />Ross, for the other hand,discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for Susan, her partner. (We see him moving to a new apartment during the episode)<br /><br />Monica, in this episode, makes out (and eventually sleeps) with Paul "the wine guy", who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife. But in reality, he was just deceiving her.<br /><br />Ps: I just loooove Joey's and Chandler's haircuts in this first season! =)	-2.970160244290158	-1.7189255336341176	-1.124292446213403	-1.1043723093856044	-0.9940335365626193	-0.6934274819320803	-0.5293945938128012	-0.4888514165781075	-0.3375471180214925	-0.17687397199762606	-0.1706480466019284	-0.01044103054300214	0.03914208452950729	0.1012672413368692	0.13677695804907586	0.19445127675810392	0.4347798258997503	0.4816421946870155	0.5822818913710692	0.5895921949174002	0.6687409651897869	0.6801255692303434	0.6979947663805955	1.6872859899807462	3.4055221940107514

Not all movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to, and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists. However with that said, I was really disappointed in l'apartment's ending. In my opinion the ending didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told.<br /><br />You spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have impacted majorly on everyones character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open.<br /><br />Overall though this movie was very well made, and unlike similar movies such as Serendipity all the scenes were believable and didn't go over the top.	-1.8825804078582768	-1.3568137795463506	-1.3470193795594714	-1.1460975498615604	-0.9092649729627201	-0.3842700108705582	-0.3585499229041775	-0.31754045935827846	-0.25895439359736905	-0.14486368627202867	-0.13755977119086202	-0.12252550215688444	-0.0731531922159649	-0.045975877016486394	-0.039944537440303726	0.017018882495783177	0.09238117884802122	0.2793993883356476	0.3067641872037607	0.4496819472898695	0.5924509190092552	0.9611751601134877	0.9749909783401063	1.8006287951710567	2.700291640496304	
The plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character that could have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story. He is evil and a wife beater. It's a character as far from his NYPD and LA Law roles as you could possibly get.<br /><br />If you've thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role, her's your present.<br /><br />But!!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and little black minidresses throughout the movie.<br /><br />She has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies. This makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer.<br /><br />I'd buy the DVD for this reason only if it was available.	-2.791354520379533	-1.8496276144274575	-1.8017090864014809	-1.5641018969901195	-1.1553929881333278	-1.1108527959490655	-0.6730478813385293	-0.6132975867625332	0.05213403154879656	0.08397004582172234	0.17948343196032351	0.18639967019268722	0.1883325240466147	0.24544383988598645	0.25742050407664857	0.337703888225913	0.3464305013002711	0.5236814851791589	0.548408907284458	0.5874833992115175	0.6358635431237789	1.0299416466147504	1.6264858574903391	2.3456358199615486	4.355139114577627	
It has been said, "a city on hill cannot hide itself" and Virginia City, Nevada, perched on the side of Mt. Davidson at 6200 ft. west of Tahoe, is a prime example, or in the context of the movie, should be. Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver, suspiciously the same year the Civil War began. It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name "Mark Twain" and went on to become America's most famous writer. It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune, and the launching pad of John Mackay, who became the wealthiest man in America, the third wealthiest man in the world. Hey, they should have made the movie about him! In the 1860's Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest "metropolitan" area west of St. Louis and East of San Francisco. But Virginia City (the movie) misses all that and is more about a hogwash North/South duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott. Flynn is Capt. Kerry Bradford, a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt. Vance Irby, played by Scott. These two are always getting in each other's way. Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being "snuck" out of VC by who else other than . . . Irby! "Hey, what's he doing here!?" Horrible. Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who can't decide who's side he's on. Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named "Julia Hayne", obviously a historical lunge at the town's first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute. She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD (not Irby) from hanging and blah blah blah. Go figure. They shoulda hung the writer. In "real life" Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt. Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire, kind of like the movie. Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated. One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like they're fishing, or trying to make the bullets go faster. Not a bad idea for the movie. The same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie. Gosh, how could they miss the gold madness, profligate wealth, gun battles in the silver mines, Mark Twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown, the crooked railroad, the Opera House fire, Artemis Ward, Bulette's huge funeral, the Chinese tongs, the black saloons, the Auction . . ? All this high on a mountain surrounded by desert? The truth was unreal. Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust? Well, if you count this movie, it wouldn't be the first debacle to come out of Virginia City. It's a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a "city of illusions," where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . . Okay, other than that it's a fun movie. Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they're destroying. If Flynn would just play his rotten self I'd double my rating.	-11.880489622169605	-5.858245464509792	-4.940489807907221	-4.870308400660089	-3.6083510066208313	-3.451150592841541	-3.155417840294335	-1.3215396427891364	-1.141161462905515	-0.43643888020392646	-0.27724479876494834	0.008023179139392315	0.10663400917518567	0.20462889701405274	0.27796116532158327	0.37897285069399317	0.4318744691825001	0.9994656097880241	1.087597780201014	1.2929764070860286	1.7488675094080632	1.855179871624555	4.563083821221413	5.176790376845082	11.794801886450765	
The Movie was sub-par, but this Television Pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a Sci-Fi fans Ideal program. The Actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.	-1.3518689238811883	-0.7300028439977788	-0.5499227380042391	-0.24873718290534194	-0.2464902216385828	-0.2224928974154669	-0.2052159476417588	-0.12575065971749305	-0.11521865626555079	-0.09658540000303885	0.10001985078436583	0.13860489848326712	0.16575366292596247	0.19604397634492876	0.28111733400183103	0.2989394939740974	0.3357000229503009	0.3717519983392326	0.38317628330974807	0.39045055847824106	0.7423944280497529	0.7670143689320752	0.8959314527204942	0.9068343234195205	1.1252165565121874	
This movie barely followed the story line of the movie. All of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie. They ended up turning it into a cheesy "tween" Disney movie "crush" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the part, or one of the likes. This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can't believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap, basic rendition. If you've ever read the book, I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of "Lord of the Rings" equivalence. This movie should have never been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time. Poorly done.	-4.493085402958387	-2.807788294371079	-2.216368740403225	-1.8467438480864695	-1.420882093330292	-1.3830180679308124	-0.9044148785724878	-0.3246816237280584	-0.17046531634490558	-0.141106021768457	-0.09024768250181961	-0.05235071315272967	-0.05126134385186263	0.09328535160279622	0.12402927878257707	0.2675803546241914	0.6733698036526051	0.7514505201685562	0.7892472386544302	0.7909501316247348	1.4558061291320805	1.5394398098907296	2.3227948725988252	2.5609508790538857	5.57836653874784

<br /><br />Having read the unemployed critic's, review, I went to a screening of "Radio" not knowing what to expect. Thankfully, the unemployed critic now appears, to me anyway, a frustrated film director/movie critic. His review is callous and totally uncalled for!<br /><br />This is a movie that will make you laugh, it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause!<br /><br />To paraphrase a line delivered by Actor Ed Harris in the final Barbershop scene "...and all this time that we thought we were teaching Radio, truth is...He was teaching us. He treats us all the time, like we wish we treated each other, some of the time!"<br /><br />Yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings. Yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes Cuba Gooding Jr. (In an Oscar worthy performance) is a little over the top at times (See the Christmas day dance scene) but you know what? SO WHAT! Every once in awhile the community of America needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country. We need to be reminded how great we CAN be.<br /><br />This is a solid cast. I was particularly pleased to see S. Epatha Merkerson, portraying Radio's mother, do something outside of Law and Order. I always wondered, is Ms. Merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on Law and Order. After watching this movie, it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor.<br /><br />Also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is Alfre Woodard as the Principal, Debra Winger in a career-resurrecting role of Coach Jones's wife and Chris Mulkey as Protagonist, Frank Clay.<br /><br />We cannot over look Ed Harris's performance as Coach Harold Jones. After reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the Deep South my self, It is hard to truly appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this film. As Coach Jones, Ed delivers a quiet, rock solid performance, that of a man on a mission. Coach Harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart, is the right thing to do.<br /><br />If you see this movie, make sure you hang around for the end credits. You will be in for a treat as the real James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, now in his mid 50's, is shown, still leading the T.L. Hanna Football team on to the field every Friday night.<br /><br />One final note. If you were a teen in the mid to late 70's, this movie is worth the price of admission, for the sound track alone!	-5.416599215394248	-4.0100344323909125	-3.9662470650369936	-2.9349956412719873	-0.9939774729355002	-0.8305141018876122	-0.4451156759357723	-0.4352434306125884	-0.20109765143180336	-0.11348858928691799	-0.004915783127454415	0.23829940073643113	0.25961957706273153	0.6047538190707635	0.9900639779926161	1.332860686756435	1.4717272170547635	1.5216655571176054	1.7554218481848374	2.0755991304851373	2.1308943917785226	2.8280180652527322	4.697728847793568	6.3938413506433225	7.204942379599634	
I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it pretty comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. Part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. There's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, Valley of the Dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this. Instead of the cool head-twisting, sailor cursing, and crucifix humping that Regan did in The Exorcist; you get a lot of Isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. Yeah, it's Chuck E. Cheese gone wild. So, if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.	-3.1732663473268006	-1.9294497252543776	-1.6521510699622644	-1.1427284056464657	-0.8661437182922822	-0.6874995052770619	-0.6587043799820508	-0.6351399519109044	-0.3443767490659896	-0.22108980443670462	-0.14370250015319846	-0.1385264438008004	0.02837161730398506	0.08991262098006417	0.31261372958056133	0.3308502026845872	0.3441827839173009	0.40556620870291993	0.5863011385436652	0.7887627465930486	0.800220944879079	0.9147822406329679	1.0739286063877262	1.8814070363578188	3.4132958837354255	
Hulk Hogan and Zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. Hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal I'll never know why.

Clyde Bruckman borrows the premise of this short from Buster Keaton's "Seven Chances," recently tepidly remade as "The Bachelor." In the original, Buster has 24-hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money. In this version, musical teacher Prof. Shemp has only 7 hours (After all, it is a short!). This is one of the better Stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines (Including the telephone booth scene with Moe & Shemp, reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's "Berth Marks" and the Marx Brothers famous stateroom scene in "Night At The Opera - here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine). I'm not a huge Stooges fan, but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts.	-2.2653077164267605	-0.899237824988285	-0.7800479989141558	-0.6524891093362537	-0.40825638147592597	-0.408243092728707	-0.32270838606887126	-0.2462618033074166	-0.21434357978796975	-0.10800608553379479	-0.1007354637637264	-0.05662489359856408	0.005132273529470183	0.08685814607095592	0.10346524433987991	0.1068907206453659	0.15314046529657768	0.15593335419387389	0.18623997227405845	0.24545354689954033	0.332604769346046	0.4792028616170581	0.7463920553522955	1.0626513227684575	2.4401975295959364	
Calling this a "Sunday School" movie might be generous, because, even as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I wouldn't want to see it at my church. The message is, "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you won't get left behind at the rapture." There was no love. I guess when you get right down to it, I don't believe in the god portrayed in this film. The guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like Count Dracula.<br /><br />Aside from the spiritual/religious element, the script was tedious--saying the same thing over and over. That might have been to make up for some of the acting, which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time, so they just said the same thing over and over.<br /><br />I did enjoy the final scenes. I thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a Sunday School formula. The movie wasn't all bad, just most of it.<br /><br />I am in favor of more clean movies that are well-done and that present truth in a non-preachy way. This wasn't one of those, I am sorry to say. I took my family to this film, wanting to support that kind of movie. Now I'd like my money back.	-4.776276164240429	-3.036830970207379	-2.853014172094393	-2.6483613970608397	-1.941142239493721	-1.690321657299935	-1.4977177889810782	-0.600170372785968	-0.5707142668719147	-0.45459149092310713	0.08580844672030373	0.2532134455280278	0.2653614277650822	0.270415454667379	0.3703712621644052	0.5534511040978278	0.724110705674947	0.74860700116145	0.8293128794735263	0.8320104910749017	1.0738351330730622	1.62839294095958	2.3319686108979814	3.8046184937739174	6.865176949034071	
Your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller; but, pray, who's will? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.<br /><br />Small _apocalyptically themed outing, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies. And it's not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well. The villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor.<br /><br />This wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation, that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated. Anyway, the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; but the End of the World is not at all his pride!	-3.3846677709714426	-1.9512204516014453	-1.7263062567412215	-1.4633036527179142	-1.4613871127546978	-0.8340408884189983	-0.8194679699305223	-0.5836984368218198	-0.31707005718115694	-0.2849449259812001	-0.1949632537515188	-0.1502069775959613	-0.10415793355186999	-0.04059280626427166	0.1509453811035255	0.31088390039490943	0.3859923412453533	0.3913795267318563	0.4051961774221573	0.44598514624365404	0.4615535370072511	0.7603563806303529	0.882597106740925	1.897639335635088	3.534286668350214	
I remembered the title so well. To me, it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And it had Vincent Massey's voice from behind whiskers. Well Flora Robson was great. Her next signature, for me, would be "55 Days at Peking". The same role but with different sumptuous gowns. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I like black-and-white films. Was everything done in Elizbethan times at night? It was talky and difficult to fathom, at times. I couldn't tell which was the love interest. Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the Armada. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This might have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts.

Probably the finest fantasy film ever made. Sumptuous colour, spectacular sets, incredible, spot-on Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood. Acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands, but here the poetic dialog is deftly, sensitively spoken (the humour is subtle and delightful as well).<br /><br />Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enthralled by this one. Along with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two finest motion pictures released by Alexander Korda and London Films---and one of the finest motion pictures ever made.<br /><br />A true, compelling classic!	-4.235274715794443	-1.6727427860642687	-1.3475923707226227	-1.0198903867065692	-0.508710211163186	-0.30191276005800044	-0.20985900709937555	-0.1512707927880505	-0.14899261526227714	0.012825614259548729	0.07079464367216079	0.2594287508167476	0.7794061548371882	1.0604484227385662	1.1999115824891304	1.4991335407580608	1.4991563783291686	1.582676421001823	1.913778658006643	2.0223928578100656	2.2544267417084995	2.346780150318772	2.627459888427319	3.515525857437465	3.8189402601638562	
I saw this film on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture "...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life." Heartland gave that award to this film.<br /><br />This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich "gentlemen", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon.<br /><br />And the story is inspirational. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of "Holes") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.<br /><br />And, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.<br /><br />This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.<br /><br />This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans."<br /><br />FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.	-3.659117546104798	-3.1996045980628054	-2.7412096354671838	-2.338772668860873	-1.1761683987109137	-0.9662528382685446	-0.9148263091586992	-0.8465906679016558	-0.20495314540909298	-0.10274588826238011	0.06295580584434717	0.12613943324275423	0.22224239329906215	0.39736661879155755	0.8015625467062212	1.2541812615555776	1.302136444194625	1.5449956526157556	1.5649280911243655	1.6109385814485255	1.6551520211297583	2.1535598884645104	3.819567511337957	4.672455078961251	5.45522404198549	
Earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic Odyssey story to a '30's nostalgia period piece. The adventurers this time are escaped convicts, wandering about the Depression afflicted South bungling their way into trouble.<br /><br />The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. Besides its value to the tone of the movie, the music is just plain fun to listen to.<br /><br />What cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable. In a comedy, you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all. They're not imposing enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. They're offered up as clowns, but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades, they just aren't funny.<br /><br />Like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an "odyssey," encountering a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. Everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word being "stupid." People are mocked right and left, and consequently, no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing. The movie doesn't like its own characters, and it doesn't let you like them, either.<br /><br />Riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion. Some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or bore you. I did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character. But there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes; an example: some '30's Dillinger-type guy strafes cows with a tommy-gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon.<br /><br />Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better. Unless you're a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But buy the soundtrack CD; the music is great.	-7.124424643783273	-4.718324045871973	-4.2932083263596805	-3.8416116615545626	-3.6301652868924696	-2.8104424388155413	-2.0919300363852105	-0.7867901266663588	-0.10838509013433278	-0.08312821310513835	-0.07671883892301867	-0.049959622883230526	0.29926550244616323	0.31349934332630613	0.3351608815299051	0.38365117485170475	0.5860716020382012	0.8355849022002787	1.005476996852971	1.8297105129699722	1.9199448543552071	2.14872723155063	2.2370933647979037	5.778754927581665	10.614726687478448	
This has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for it's exposure of the injustices of bigotry. Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and truly awesome as Corby/White Wolf. However, felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that can be watched over and over without tiring.	-0.9034213911022807	-0.8286765947043102	-0.6338397353262285	-0.3822820012750201	-0.22781342514256714	-0.15134330313048472	-0.0544972846361958	-0.04868365802467261	-0.012851027679506317	0.04419382489308053	0.06968603180834157	0.09693563063363439	0.15026248160291875	0.23418281797711768	0.236240862555161	0.24327892206037785	0.3135250395042332	0.33135388878914224	0.40048372086105405	0.5081097508438943	0.5626022141069075	0.6894323492525833	0.9578170041561788	1.2070916668407476	1.3559881184853615	
First of all, I really can't understand how some people "enjoyed" this movie. It's the worst thing I have ever seen. Even the actors seem to be bored...and I think that says it all!<br /><br />However, I have to give my applause to the opening credits creators - that team seems to have a really good future. That's why I recommend the big studios to watch ONLY the opening credits, and one or two special effects sequences (if they're watched outside this movie, it almost looks like a good movie).<br /><br />Better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this... this "thing!".	-2.696900014319106	-1.8464012119380226	-1.5859063629052514	-1.5061017267833334	-1.5031926519915868	-0.777304925839853	-0.7215116799488672	-0.7162074339193342	-0.34622373074684654	-0.19501204453724794	-0.14424830610597877	-0.08393621461489219	0.03788379754444249	0.12098735364699487	0.23635950193204786	0.46311998931249837	0.4821833884865414	0.4944902734386827	0.5137209456707229	0.6027266139575019	0.6720749579820988	0.6961646634755422	0.824507810838173	2.220894776326485	3.3998461747870152	
Wang Bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'King of masks' for his mastery of Sichuan change art. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with Wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to Wang's mind. The film is about prejudices, male domination, state of art, values and most importantly warmth.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film enough. The whole film is in loops. Everything has a significance. Its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes it is an artistic film, next five minutes its a sad film, next five minutes its a thriller. It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face. Last scene on the rope is phenomenal. Story and script is flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for Oscars. That year 'English patient' got the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category 'Kolya' won. 'Kolya' was just OK and about 'English patient' the lesser said the better. Watch it 9/10.	-5.63316621969483	-4.670549812142075	-3.437235350258318	-2.4263015588947403	-1.5726561627549982	-1.019203376619355	-0.44777005280195903	-0.3926243700779616	-0.19297126003287218	-0.1261843775328254	0.5869797364465145	0.9553442083493592	1.0187953170070405	1.0318526275350657	1.123917092015989	1.2497547910822637	1.3065691497926226	1.4030726673613896	1.5401393099765976	2.0393686395626016	2.188322750461894	2.564869130223221	4.322749237925269	4.586247031772758	6.444921179597978	
From today's point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film 18 (or X in the US). The film has a sexual, yet sublime erotic story to tell, but the pictures are rather innocent. Throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late 60s and early 70s in the fashion, the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting. And this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing.	-1.2757756888464562	-0.7955293290809806	-0.7251864435761463	-0.6433997541356967	-0.34881212355850827	-0.34529367506409747	-0.1889479313606676	-0.1621296491595681	-0.13266521808729503	-0.11674322790739233	-0.10011830396785443	-0.09065259981915907	0.008779096856497082	0.020227776825600424	0.13541964195257383	0.20454778636984225	0.2784337224012766	0.28061592844365946	0.3033561364154729	0.3073940312365954	0.3855449514235014	0.414924558059649	0.9688901846224351	1.1645449236782115	1.1716640200352395	
Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties, was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. Rest of the movie It's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse. Much worse. Directing is awful. Acting is awful. Script is awful. Dialog is awful. Action is awful. Music is quite good actually. Typical score for eighties action movies. This movie is so bad that it goes close to anything Andy Sidaris has ever produced. It's so bad that there isn't proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie. But still, there was Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /><br />I think they can now bring the film out on DVD. It could be cool! And they should write on the cover: ACADEMY AWARD WINNER SANDRA BULLOCk IN HANGMEN<br /><br />1 out of 10	-8.505418604634558	-4.921331282468112	-4.548790955436643	-3.875798815409818	-3.3420842323565156	-2.8920391264863774	-2.180502965807299	-0.6677395207795224	-0.30644141207706316	-0.2972020052317411	-0.2086321881170511	0.3692610373861643	0.41274103916147803	0.42608259202347887	0.4683825047024874	0.6637161915420227	0.7274169647050062	0.7856987803405531	1.470874185736991	1.5830922224422568	2.054742883870922	2.6295270870703984	2.7294780178870637	5.539590147638137	10.129454080549232	
I kid you not. Yes, "Who's That Girl" has the distinction for being one in a string of Madonna's films that bombed, but I actually liked this movie more than "Desperately Seeking Susan". In "Susan", Madonna's character is relegated to being second-fiddle to Rosanna Arquette and is not given much to work with. No disrespect to Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this zany, outrageous character, only done in an 80s style. While it may seem "cheesy" today, this is actually one of Madonna's best and one of her most underrated films.<br /><br />Madonna plays Nikki Finn, an ex-con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn't commit. She's being released from jail after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Louden Trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station. Of course, when these two get together, that's when the madness happens. Sir John Mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of Manhattan with a rainforest(???) on his roof. <br /><br />This movie parodies everything. Rich people, the sleazy characters who live in Harlem and totally destroy Louden's Rolls-Royce, the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunne around town, and Dunne's stuck-up fiance Wendy Worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in New York City (played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake's girlfriend Caroline in Sixteen Candles). Hilarious! Plus, Dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of "Bringing Up Baby". Plus, Madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. Throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of WTG.<br /><br />Madonna is the queen of deadpan acting. There are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly, it turns out to be funny! That's how some of the best comedy should be played - straight. Madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so. Later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark, sexually-charged roles in the notorious movies "Body of Evidence" and "Dangerous Game". <br /><br />Some people say Madonna cannot act, and that is fine, people are entitled to their opinion, but I believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between Madonna playing a character on film, instead they still see only Madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies. It's still a fun, screwball comedy of the 80s. Not for everyone, I'm sure some of you will dislike it, so I would recommend it mainly for Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and like it! <br /><br />Interesting note: One of Madonna's friends from her early-80s New York club days, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member in the bands Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band.	-4.562456832967509	-4.006784417774948	-3.9671118680835584	-2.982768645221183	-2.9338555625836675	-2.3681407377481545	-1.1014484092457955	-1.1000642052351324	-0.4914192539491328	-0.4184358101697959	-0.3010202512761966	-0.2960027701426922	-0.21694532672169237	0.0022064230109986316	0.19360236732924327	0.25601425838331565	0.49881257007328644	0.6297062375242523	1.6537326964057009	2.336202993369879	3.2239662132086857	3.877572785914734	4.38802073258118	5.203111947866358	8.807871480362	
When I spotted that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, score! I admit, I was eager to see the movie. And I have to say, the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way. Then it went all down hill. I didn't expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo. They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story. I was appalled that Noah was involved in anything of the sort, especially his role. Nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the Vietnam War. If anyone really wants to know how Communism was like, sit down and read a book on it. And not one that praises it or is against it, just the cold hard facts.<br /><br />I only watched a few scenes here and there only because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all that interested me. Everything else about this movie irritated me.	-5.239235019884826	-2.3182397791350757	-2.0186967898430157	-1.954547740825555	-1.8746436682813912	-1.668567629534945	-1.5538049271555523	-0.8254545591593478	-0.4891638615296031	-0.3790907436854573	-0.1884998926389994	0.03956452208746669	0.05562040448741554	0.13058839429436878	0.3884758627101083	0.4063760694067796	0.6050082222727065	0.6340691188018182	0.8602949474778424	0.896041920724804	0.9092176288031099	1.0536561415288583	1.9342706339489928	2.5841833635309874	5.91786726295611	
I enjoyed this film. The way these mutants looked, along with the tone of the film, is very good. Plus, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was great! It makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life (except for the killings of course).<br /><br />I was impressed with the creatures for this film, although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget, the mutants/creatures/monsters looked great, especially from 1990. This is definitely a unique film and not crap. It makes me want to go find a read the novella it's based off of. This is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the "monsters" are the one with humanity.	-3.210276269684468	-2.5034566416866793	-1.3258083326525865	-1.1335957354739477	-0.7476953167587732	-0.3902658412432753	-0.020994224555399517	0.029047806585538592	0.13897393440035993	0.1558735591806944	0.6043296585796223	0.731602297189541	0.7325516069770504	0.7758904644397538	0.8099155931942491	0.8367938201753258	0.8444106865059507	0.9692505840302678	1.1476268127363973	1.3482395235591684	1.4857632838621309	1.5925003748958537	2.2102831888750845	2.3854142052595444	3.6806940504361654	
First of all, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all we're not a Hollywood film.<br /><br />Then get amateur actors. It will be good for the festival hype. After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? Then, hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light. You see, if it's well-lit, it won't look "real" and the festival people won't like it. Who needs to have professional level photography anyway? Then hire a ten-year old who has never held a camera to be your operator. It will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for "reality" and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people, critics and a small sliver of the audience who over-intellectualize will scream "genius" because they won't believe this was just complete amateur-hour.<br /><br />Once you've done that, buy your ticket to the Festival of Bad Movies aka Sundance.<br /><br />What a sad waste.	-5.135792729168737	-2.1554786652044324	-1.8031736444458797	-1.624410175019566	-1.54105831666799	-1.4636066626476987	-1.133096085956991	-0.8342572853289811	-0.3540633360904764	-0.2732407554703893	-0.18281646379126615	0.00255672261688511	0.05374798795824767	0.07027266946547561	0.1319509460348653	0.2628954532659457	0.36670335456113495	0.40969964543293835	0.4515666967343116	0.4927953758887358	0.5604740635706699	0.8222752930607703	2.0947585217693145	2.444820110160772	5.406969800591493	
The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. Set in 1930s China during a time of floods, we meet Wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang, he invites Wang to join their troupe. However, we learn that Wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. Learning that Wang is childless, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart, Wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.<br /><br />Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. The story is absorbing. The setting is serene and the costuming simple. Summarily, it is an International Award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire.	-2.4801715314008512	-1.9322766788040509	-1.6113541535052773	-0.910849154681515	-0.6789698281414537	-0.6144664601380931	-0.5654621162430705	-0.4726922335222752	-0.3836740538575055	-0.36717430095272896	-0.11071763517811797	-0.05750809261591216	-0.018320828473554825	0.18236492100738658	0.6681345677773818	0.699048131434866	0.7430134170230617	0.7658957422316897	0.8785423475697494	0.9475339397914982	0.9508340204758232	1.3148055705000912	2.1798784791454273	2.579918852953106	3.183430100584824	
This is a docudrama story on the Lindy Chamberlain case and a look at it's impact on Australian society. It especially looks at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas.<br /><br />One issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations. Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis. Just because the characters in the movies and on TV act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so. This is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings. It's an issue that has to be constantly addressed.<br /><br />The leads play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based-on-fact individuals. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in Australia as comic actors. It re-enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals.<br /><br />(Spoiler warning!)<br /><br />I have to say something very personal here; in that I am actually an ex-Adventist who was a practicing member in Australia at the time this incident occurred; so I have a slightly different impression of the story than most. I think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality, and emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers. It captured the themes of the story brilliantly.<br /><br />I once heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to "play the best case for their character they could". While this is especially apt for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well.	-3.1214167042157643	-3.0926486487847855	-2.463682851855686	-2.3510772593571776	-1.9560173847474422	-1.0231598342333548	-0.593379001527996	-0.5198192675320609	-0.4171937564815221	-0.3098335322095043	-0.2708697715225651	-0.2613925121645134	-0.14299889065222962	-0.039028579449519235	0.13118350042253016	0.766641050826364	0.959515023010932	0.9845917396760687	1.0435299141573764	1.2115092590140275	1.6622016033439295	1.9405878881268501	3.9411392753614622	4.046197418832701	5.81257768072697	
Not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts.<br /><br />*Makeup that a child can do. *Acting was over done...poor directing. *Editing was very choppy...many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous. *Sound was badly dubbed. *Music was highly inappropriate. *Casting was extremely off...must have been on crack. *Zombies that talk let alone...drive, dance, work...just pisses me off. *And the bad guy...Holy Crap!

O boy, was this really bad.<br /><br />I saw this on videotape.<br /><br />In scenes that had soundtrack music, it was hard to hear the dialog. When people were on the telephone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used, because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional.<br /><br />One indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report comes on TV. There is just a "news flash" title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a TV screen, and a voice-over by a newscaster. They couldn't shoot footage of a newscaster, and then actually show it on the TV?<br /><br />The movie starts off with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and mask, wielding a scalpel. Supposedly he's a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on him.<br /><br />Students are let out of school for a break, and three young women decide to have a slumber party. Three guys decide to crash the party, and a geek named Science decides to crash it too. The slumber party is pretty boring, and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks, taking the masks off, and then disappearing. The mother and father (the surgeon who was to do the lobotomy) of one of the girls keep showing up too. The killer knocks slices people's throats without anyone really noticing. The apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie. Perhaps that was bad acting, or maybe it was intentional, since much of the movie is a nightmare, and some of it a nightmare within a nightmare.<br /><br />The ending is really horrible too.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is the cheesy United Home Video VHS box art, which was revived for the DVD release (a double feature with Terror at Tenkiller). I honestly can't tell if it is a photo, or a painting, or a combination of both. The women pictured on the cover are not in the movie, and the clothing they're wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore. The throat slicing on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie - where people tend to affect a goofy pop-eyed look. For that matter, that's what the killer has most of the time: head cocked, and eyes bugging out, mugging for the camera. Frequently the scalpel was held up close to the camera in focus, while the killer's mask-covered face was in close-up but out of focus in the background.	-13.420495170105609	-6.06678957222551	-5.907025235620566	-5.370686123020895	-4.987050284197592	-3.8368181068979004	-2.2339174191396447	-1.5535675779094191	-1.3717280630826412	-1.0930462178455649	-0.9793178053046728	-0.5227496822878033	-0.1589509365783665	0.19181118544307194	0.708564691352025	0.7280744044088444	0.7382993157749467	1.311764650294446	1.52231015103136	1.5695129421609642	1.7092289097077351	2.2423268901861566	5.374994691254485	6.8784934757544285	13.865753709344895	
The finest short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened, due to the density of insight it offers. There's irony in that comment and little merit. The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. I might have preferred that the narrator be less "recognizable", but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect. This is a short for people who read, for those whose "bar" is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty. A beautiful short film. FWIW: I was pleased at the Picasso reference, since I once believed that Picasso was just another art whore with little talent; like, I assume, most people - until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12. Picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime. I understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for.	-1.8807779123868955	-1.8057970617323802	-1.7128399553088112	-1.5960889609117546	-0.8853492288592754	-0.8645898531103493	-0.6582032534499895	-0.3564131787694113	-0.1410491031380643	-0.012991322797074817	-0.002275325079704113	0.155375177592801	0.22140355908704445	0.4817944581377861	0.5175879339018886	0.6043926705991305	0.7440001860811059	0.9075439755881326	1.0132529493154734	1.0598338813311963	1.2376146030701562	1.439260312425407	2.641323253468389	2.900283104489872	3.912616177550786	
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch. With such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. The excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. The flash-backs were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. <br /><br />The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. <br /><br />The photography in Empire Falls was lovely. Too bad it wasn't a travelogue.<br /><br />I read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself. I would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel's reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie. This was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not Books on Tape.	-5.64374045715137	-2.4926049685530423	-2.3593239243108037	-2.3535207570333228	-2.051061765362481	-1.9336520029789908	-1.6063700914432526	-0.668706963360848	-0.4704972256763688	-0.2284354772020341	-0.11876568124698834	-0.033683606015934106	0.2790775486486421	0.3436753475147296	0.5474368116899692	0.5844510064137987	0.611894422677187	0.7774413396784305	0.9084048013807982	0.958610300015026	1.1358406182928833	1.1364937703710636	2.0837876142068286	2.8924138326874895	7.003121214235345	
When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening, I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it. I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. People I talked to said there was too much talking! Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. They also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy OR sad. This disgusts me. Nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? And as for the ending (and I don't want to be a spoiler), I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again. It's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. It's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people. But it certainly spoke to me. Give it a chance! Be patient with it! Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna. Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass. It's very intimate. Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. They must have improvised during some parts and it works well. They have a great chemistry in their roles. Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr. Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made. It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much. Bravo for romance!!!	-6.737396866351064	-4.366991343513412	-4.273675922896918	-3.9560679216909738	-2.24322668583683	-1.4251706734944039	-1.4151919831079296	-0.7415300393721492	-0.6860127497088477	-0.26239431711802624	0.11257258215793557	0.6847877008039688	0.7788266563804693	0.8104392893514959	0.9686159911038345	1.1061466361918932	1.6994351057832533	2.014313403494995	2.1296978427267383	2.1735920761667034	2.4111595949787112	2.8672140130327364	6.346403951386922	7.641498477820111	9.128971944087663	
Journalist Bob Woodward's blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie, a nebulous "fantasy" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "The Shield") is put in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, taking a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating those "Saturday Night Live" skits which are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone try to out-Lucy Lucille Ball--it can't be done. The reason why there was such sorrow at Belushi's death was because he was one of a kind. Chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part, and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue. Still, it's an uphill venture and no actor--no matter how talented--could have saved it. * from ****	-2.111550157746774	-1.5116461941086563	-1.2444411786192806	-1.058354327303433	-0.8297332033241688	-0.5223848525609779	-0.3274256994139129	-0.302094803889913	-0.2630908635228459	-0.1267934337115651	-0.11501052384587764	0.06385598405499202	0.07523372670077655	0.13363017724341733	0.1435362815708307	0.1479147509202684	0.15825694993217593	0.2528590230955906	0.3063115678641427	0.6545108066260582	0.808772616345012	0.9459600860432118	1.1834460588883362	1.5761515701550008	2.8442449074321927	
I was looking forward to this movie. Trustworthy actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? IF you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Know it. OK I did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but I thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire-Which! they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone-oblivious to the consequences. Great riddles that fell by the wayside. The promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so-called criminal. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. I understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found Adrian Pauls role crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so. What? Run out of ideas! Such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly. It may not comprehend the meaning and I really did not expect the writers to understand it but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road	-4.18218120815826	-2.980831884795637	-2.7319150182322325	-1.800867919529936	-1.2351527889475682	-0.9390181340734631	-0.7503555964068919	-0.7138603005565763	-0.4651375967055416	-0.22493258465441754	-0.18182828250693445	-0.014069177772247948	0.015637302802917554	0.09401361119585233	0.20699379106522714	0.28375582509446934	0.3959035602194828	0.41312564522662465	0.5686762145723757	0.6806743216261977	1.0113303844993995	1.621593059575869	1.672036844387211	2.457303424575933	5.145050018822723	
In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this movie hits where it truly hurts... in the heart! A prim, proper female psychiatrist, hungry for adventure, meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals. The vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman, and begs to be involved in his operation. While the movie moves kind of "slow", it's climax and ending are stunning! You'll especially enjoy how the doctor "forgives herself"!	-1.1801356402448415	-1.152380661042264	-1.0222078384633215	-0.9379397130502484	-0.8252284621712863	-0.5948062214179782	-0.25424865646589034	-0.11868987573035783	-0.101158541036513	-0.014591826023295153	0.06881320208654798	0.1338630176883301	0.19983682894823937	0.2612274151905464	0.28914351716648645	0.3722261718810528	0.3824447689375442	0.4923230472113518	0.5699062249882524	0.6043801271414115	0.6178772101968071	0.6556962938821764	1.4394142049605536	1.7133694911401047	1.8539044017436268	
Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1 + 2? God was behind everything? What has God got to do with Sci-Fi? God is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something. In fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head, etc. so they explain it with "angels" or just don't explain it at all.<br /><br />The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through. For example, why does Galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl (Hera), particularly after Adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue? Because they found out the location of the Cylon base? That's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives. And how did Anders know the location? And what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war? It's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment.<br /><br />The people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series. Feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical Christians on a mission to spread 'The Word'. Forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot, the important message the writers wanted to get across is: don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation (tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment).<br /><br />Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they tell you there is no "force"... instead, a Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus. Then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the Ewoks. Would this be a good ending? No it frakken' wouldn't.	-7.728231821659211	-3.3083249649871216	-2.8213253918282057	-2.742821021666906	-2.629320099578824	-1.7546176800321316	-1.475119657079339	-1.1511397709817521	-0.8564819459989312	-0.8274765368178884	-0.3541637247621764	-0.2500906876292645	-0.08392588527768123	0.05919399475651475	0.37794992255510373	0.4817406365976013	0.5155166319837287	0.7640167910741611	1.065929774168491	1.1117601833891835	1.379097522773118	1.888769792334496	2.8337074534501987	4.571758176860454	8.181746338144036	
Nightbreed blew my mind the first time I saw it. And it's held up quite well over the years. The sets and monster effects work, are some of the best I've ever seen. Nobody I know seems to have seen this film, which I believe tanked at the box office, because of the lack of interest in horror, in the early nineties. It plays like a dark, horrific fairy tale, and is a lot deeper, then you'd think, with a strong message against bigotry, presented by a rich mystical past, that Clive Barker created. What sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note, that we'll probably never see. My only minor gripe is that Craig Sheffer is only a passable actor at best, and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part. Just a minor complaint though as Sheffer does alright. I had a similar issue with Scott Bakula in Barker's Lord Of Illusions, not really a terrible performance, but I just didn't like him in the role as much as I would have other people.	-1.9501199073428952	-1.7745410881409938	-1.7484504807721128	-1.2056920536152627	-1.150214034620904	-0.8428005545617997	-0.6607398407760858	-0.6493555269334377	-0.43491420823426796	-0.41975773169750297	-0.369970243204634	-0.030266044832242794	0.16073222928565045	0.1999455934095683	0.27239907993326945	0.3087721219053823	0.43281428557560225	0.6430587930408281	0.9579848578867363	1.1555056630973013	1.2542913180264594	1.2869809462193342	1.9785327331541291	2.52861615546018	3.121033224403879	
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.<br /><br />From the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest I didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a Shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.<br /><br />I have never, and I mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crap films.<br /><br />Turd.	-3.7225864771128885	-2.03129207666617	-1.7608281763505382	-1.5910869394100926	-1.569155204514316	-0.7096525269325736	-0.6497416041436848	-0.5131775480343249	-0.48694264154159544	-0.4539280231288532	-0.44667811940888674	-0.15584256899488758	-0.11416683692389112	-0.09576801257329869	0.0444917232942509	0.28628469002319473	0.30413738168176524	0.4153610220698539	0.47895823474333854	0.5788781009873015	0.5852672005912143	0.7217228569328894	1.354961291807903	1.9227989946201982	3.5898705891205136	
If he wanted to be accurate, he should have chosen some Frisco natives and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about the Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I've lived in SF my entire life, and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did. Everything was over-dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. No shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here (ie his Warriors jersey). Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear; instead he fitted them in some cheesy made-up SF or Oakland jerseys that aren't even sold around here. HP has no bowling alleys, black and Asian gangbangers do NOT wear head or wristbands with the colors of Africa or China's Olympic team, nor does every Chinese gangster wear a Yao Ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops. Further, while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the Mission, all that was shown was some white dude and a self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua." This is NOT New York! Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from the ONE that was shown here, who was without a doubt from NY. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the City. An accurate depiction would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as vs. Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /><br />This film could've been much better if Lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with.	-6.883448186162984	-3.193025972706551	-3.063404764567028	-2.941626682554151	-2.8440602341993433	-2.009497421522318	-1.1225175666359033	-0.7975239123871789	-0.6640715246193997	-0.6479948242909981	-0.4090026424412563	-0.3247448597859097	-0.31657416506741365	-0.2284880428060403	0.13576612875868904	0.5419638776471218	0.5566123982919122	0.7009145459723641	0.8521723878591462	0.9827930842037776	1.0092408815139156	1.287868346091941	2.651045287145346	3.6233012821574095	7.297901987052884	
This movie is nothing more than Christian propaganda. It started off like a good sci-fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet Christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated. I had to turn it off half way through because I felt tricked into renting it. The catholic church has officially announced that aliens do NOT contradict belief in God.<br /><br />The movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable, writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all, this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided.<br /><br />There was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject. If you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels , you will love this movie.	-3.3521748560228666	-2.1900320555808404	-1.8285168389264976	-1.6388404158138115	-1.4621868831910536	-1.416532471564751	-0.935648690230296	-0.6673817910007217	-0.26460470209588066	-0.165203168801009	-0.095853982032985	-0.04324924830512693	0.055067436627884145	0.1436086924945568	0.2154583270156991	0.2843256767485785	0.4510645769195109	0.47847516540490703	0.5038137557686115	0.5397218601748528	0.6625548983615193	0.8376151628368114	1.010054782674364	2.4128398708088272	4.269206102173759	
As you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it AT HIS CHURCH ! <br /><br />Anyway, movie had a good B movie sci-fi beginning, everything was there to make a good entertaining , easy to watch movie, then everything felt in this religious Jesus-will-save-everyone brainwashing mode.<br /><br />story start with 2 main characters, 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that Jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con-descendant attitude.<br /><br />In a few words: this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes<br /><br />Waste of time, waste of money...

This movie has no story. It's only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death.<br /><br />!!!SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />This is what they do: They beat her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood, spin her around on a chair until she pukes, expose her to loud noise, pour boiling oil on her, put worms in her sores, crush her hand with a sledge-hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye.<br /><br />This movie was so realistic that if I didn't know it was fake I would have thought it was a snuff-movie. Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it. It scared me. I guess it fills some kind of purpose. I give it a 10/10.	-2.9561609514825102	-1.6385779261862918	-1.5947196398565544	-1.243630516450039	-0.6976410669852191	-0.6336408081294573	-0.5968709885994841	-0.5853122348723786	-0.30824620102246225	-0.07497783457777253	0.016774729253106524	0.023273562380556792	0.14794867142329066	0.17141058643989304	0.2032918735359287	0.24569087193302963	0.2744591807863342	0.29192315017046316	0.4408581255728796	0.5422363143912072	0.6310662894309725	0.6397270109618165	1.1860215697876213	1.243829116847807	3.100006873233598	
Read This:<br /><br />BOYZ 'N THE HOOD IS A SCENE-BY-SCENE, COMPLETE RIP-OFF OF THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />Two friends in the hood, one's focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete. The friend who's an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed. (The athlete just happens to be Washington from 'Welcome Back, Kotter'.)<br /><br />It makes me mad that people don't know this. It blows my mind everytime I go into a video store and Boyz 'n the Hood is in the 'Drama' section while Cooley High is in 'Comedy'. It's an embarrassing disgrace. This movie is both funnier and more dramatic than John Singleton's rip-off. At least Singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to Cooley High, but no, he never said a word.

Cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew it, we knew it...Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted..but they lived on.<br /><br />A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really to catch the final exploit biker film after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They were trying to make a living. But, Jocelyn Lane (from two Elvis bad flicks, TICKLE ME and something bad one) in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with J. Slate fighting for honor. It's worth seeing, but it sucks. But check it out. Well worth non-biker, non-smoker, non-boozing, "biker" types with hot chicks.	-3.5664866579944032	-3.0008928558396137	-2.046050433862973	-1.7432158331819403	-0.8731221686823432	-0.6994526435699954	-0.542522301535191	-0.256805589462067	-0.12163353229105484	-0.10923611284360982	-0.057879407129678546	0.027439578494224008	0.11994811335974868	0.16479484955364115	0.18811580565843505	0.24178482443578148	0.3204739617535858	0.3788864890618132	0.4725415887524691	0.9363852101292836	0.9829960048067106	1.0654294551510528	1.297767179603656	2.184432176860582	4.227790966708894	
Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the "hilarious" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage. Along the way we get such "great" moments of comedy like a fat cavemen swallowing a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach. A monkey throwing rocks at their heads. A man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach. The obligatory "gay" caveman. The list could go on and on. This movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck. I was bored from the onset and it only got worse as the cavemen bobbled around hitting each other, making poor jokes such as puns on the word perch, hitting each other, and mauling poor Seta Berger who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense. She is indeed one of two bright spots in this film. She isn't much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass-et? The other "bright" spot is the music. As soon as I heard the score, I said to myself that it sounded very familiar. I had never heard the actual score but the music was unmistakably that of Ennio Morricone. It's a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude, boring, lewd, unimaginative, and ridiculous film essentially about a group of Moes finding a woman for the first time and, first wanting to eat her like some animal, being taught what she could do. Awwwwh! Sorry, I'm stifling a yawn as I relive the plot! The end of the film has some 100 or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a scab off your knee. This movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever. The fact that it spawned a sequel doesn't surprise me as it offers that one thing which will prick viewer interest - tail.	-5.934099488736025	-4.566918765597563	-4.314364110162307	-3.1783900587638514	-2.764812050361341	-2.018873178101655	-1.1938500205631384	-1.0147698485713978	-0.46765212420747365	-0.4363412284504686	-0.28719143570968625	-0.10591223888722562	-0.04844459342158798	-0.0050484926234963465	0.12339774256563346	0.3328922135943237	0.3947893179978064	0.6344943285765605	1.3931231445614667	1.8176602816189598	2.227736848289002	2.6353852440160224	2.7884798529020345	5.197913995410851	8.03178801106112	
There are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning, and that ignorant fools like me don't 'get' it. Obviously this means that we should stick to Hollywood dross.<br /><br />It has every, a-hem, artistic cliché in the book - I guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few. Almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense.<br /><br />The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) movie 'Ratcatcher' returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense; it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers.	-2.4188465823839143	-1.484324477963693	-1.1608177145518568	-1.1236427460865244	-1.0582350803205949	-0.6788584445418037	-0.44424641972034085	-0.4098131211615752	-0.36544758232265095	-0.2913001703174485	-0.23858543448984898	-0.11207449789904358	-0.07997936306353554	-0.015326596609936738	-0.010249495442755885	0.08463121243662669	0.16958744856389768	0.2379373248524787	0.4542970624330721	0.5836637567834823	0.5942927057072107	0.7102843441176252	0.7920457213288182	1.5032390317115893	2.8869681015118953	
Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and also nothing could be more real than Errol Flynn playing Custer. This remains the best film made about Custer. The music of Max Steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the Irish song "Gerry Owen", which was a favourite of Custer is played. The film should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flows like in no other off their films together, and director Raoul Walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best.	-1.6577951834412017	-1.4014359472507747	-0.798865386988408	-0.6417763026812743	-0.5647524849465035	-0.35453202860935784	-0.2534455112139542	-0.10193967505899919	0.006194914870314865	0.0594185430780666	0.0955038440353673	0.15879764186423004	0.22166640870763715	0.34301089119575956	0.39143690447235213	0.4733049377224799	0.5720928693323981	0.6299662937785371	0.7825711114824878	0.8098739359967637	0.8987787070314792	1.290483279415651	1.4226719739576033	1.4898354994960896	1.8028929596546215	
Shame on Yash Raj films and Aditya Chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth You Tube standards. I was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction, plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene I just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can "THROW AWAY" crores on such stupidity. Shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to. Saif Ali Khan -completely disappointed in your choice of film. Kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and Akshay comes up as the dim-wit. Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English. His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel. DON'T WASTe any brain cells, energy or your money to go see this- Go SEE / Rent AMU -with Konkana Sensharma instead- a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of India.Intelligent, poignant and a wonderful story-tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in Indian cinema making.	-3.1865361073949563	-2.2800359032040682	-2.2118529710175454	-2.0517456713226787	-1.5678956131580093	-0.9165183656054305	-0.449594021109696	-0.44658396336042855	-0.26402831560109435	-0.25577353734902764	-0.17088894528886278	-0.15154634342700402	-0.14244851114653362	-0.12534937909070887	-0.035322733569936274	0.09025982540403193	0.3094356223740545	0.3552507834089941	0.477537504953438	0.6561265756260847	0.737327301806909	1.2265712929086008	1.6332158019824767	2.382192553681442	3.564398767925498	
Seldom do we see such short comments written by IMDb filmgoers. Perhaps it's because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth, or are we missing something? I'd watch it again if I had some incentive.<br /><br />So what's a happenstance? To the French it is "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Fate? Perhaps it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings. We've all had these (it's called life) but when looked at in this way, you begin to get the feeling that "random" might be more like "fated."<br /><br />A 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble. All these incidents cause other events that ... well you get the picture? Dominoes. Multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen. And I think that there's a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this. But then this is the magic world of cinema.<br /><br />We admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer/director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape, here's the place to do it. Or if you're recovering from surgery and aren't going anywhere anyway, this will engage you while your stitches are healing. <br /><br />"Happenstance" will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following. Stranger things have happened.<br /><br /> Soren Kierkegaard is attributed with the following: "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forward." If you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last auto accident) you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it.<br /><br />That's the answer! I forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain "Happenstance" to me.	-6.3202025935628106	-3.155048609601144	-2.515378729115073	-2.3292600627120157	-2.3115143030708274	-1.808902854350672	-1.7991742346387118	-1.4173592606185847	-1.1063901102241522	-1.0633604535161674	-0.37890708538556733	0.28972988627511886	0.315510484850127	0.5719007505234797	0.6314339631726354	0.7622105594088512	0.7744480056170231	0.787907621196099	0.8874470139547865	0.8952328268177945	0.9231378150001194	1.699876047198372	1.8565933415303009	2.8988310082885222	7.1685600469348785	
First lesson that some film makers (particularly those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just 'style' does not sell. I guess Tashan when translated will mean style. Second, if you are hell bent on selling style, that does not spare you from having a decent story.<br /><br />Tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director. But it is not slick. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this setup is not utilized to properly. There could have been a better mix and match of their narrations. Actions sequences are from the seventies.<br /><br />Cheoreography of the film is awful. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleep walked through this film. Vishal-Shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film. Why is there a sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy? <br /><br />Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotyped self. You won't mind missing this film.	-8.029637506554039	-3.154109937546169	-2.7878841598373065	-2.652161903933292	-2.435581941377358	-2.377376807363947	-1.8544441736561068	-0.8116417178253217	-0.6283348104518273	-0.2210097519671232	-0.11132512393588657	6.504860552646874E-4	0.24826447902375168	0.42759905424844147	0.5337490042508417	0.6184778898349665	0.7658677689279005	0.7989898531462115	1.0194783720956841	1.2144279492970602	1.2155082220976894	1.4924862720771528	3.5532797830901517	3.937720084829566	9.146108594246098	
We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. While not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made. However, I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle's fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. Mind you, I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I went into this affair with an open mind. I figured that a made-for-T.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. After all, the Star Wars spin-off Ewoks was decent, if a little silly. Come to think of it, the original Star Wars was made on "a lunch money budget", and look where it took George Lucas! However, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if I'd gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering. <br /><br />The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic), Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time. The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. That's right, a crow. Moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man, half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. Had I been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. The worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T.<br /><br />Having gotten the most painful part out of the way, I must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters, the acting, and the story. I, personally, had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films: plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. She was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua. In the film, she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever. In fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her. Calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock! The irony is horrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium, they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is "above gender" and likes to look at "funny" things, such as girls falling off of swings. The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes (nicknamed "the Dude With Red Eyes" due to his complete reinvention as a character).<br /><br />The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book, yet kept the sole of the original work. Here, the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld, apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen, the flat-nosed wookies of Ixchel (who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks) tear the spine up. As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earth-like Camazotz was, the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. <br /><br />I am very sorry that this film exists. I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad. It's the way the characters are written that ruins it. A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic, scored by John Williams, given its sound at Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox. In its current state, the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. The book was Good, the film was Bad, and Mrs. Whatsit was Ugly.<br /><br />Score: 0.1/10 (If I could) <br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />They got the names right. <br /><br />Cons: <br /><br />It had horrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation, script, acting and special effects, not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book. Oh, and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle. Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother to Photoshop Meg's arm on properly.	-17.803510401563802	-8.929363654604252	-8.70889826382937	-7.862023172643193	-7.274920611102208	-6.670810871392271	-5.292016176799735	-1.5717308242626182	-1.3407499568732206	-1.2521456756570972	-0.3602092064387837	-0.2750656451131527	0.0414333049362257	0.769240115242872	1.2935015562025274	1.3822540795097753	1.7108003676194097	2.0452738625546307	2.6572728462365416	3.431434277052615	3.7047194400945593	4.233089010454331	4.559801809482716	11.107465224399544	22.319401060001365	
I recently watched this again and there's another version which is shorter 1999. I get the feeling they are the same movie but I would like to know the difference.<br /><br />One is Japanese and no pikachu short is all I can come up with. Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice?? <br /><br />Prof Ivy was rather boring. She sounded as if she was almost asleep, no expression at all with the few lines she had.<br /><br />This was enjoyable enough but there wasn't much to it at all. <br /><br />A collector (whos after Lugia, he has no plan to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction.<br /><br />The pokemon movies that follow are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, with no. 8 almost here.	-3.849514155760187	-1.913501805346455	-1.7375488470517164	-1.3445598586073433	-1.1630531723330928	-0.8376106446786029	-0.633456159004059	-0.6319372063998878	-0.5187033366914033	-0.47814862640977385	-0.40561762557756065	-0.2661501514250111	0.001307559967914649	0.16204277917066828	0.16778217155457179	0.2641977751570156	0.41980862629960636	0.6025723379515859	0.6949736882010864	0.7242797176167948	0.7541438400574505	0.7971573065332098	0.8452306115472195	1.751094289618209	3.785677040403223	
I got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film,<br /><br />as it's obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it, or were stupid enough to pay to see it.<br /><br />The best reason to watch was on the Elvira show a few years back. Elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can.<br /><br />It's an ok monster flick, compared to the hundreds of horrendous American flicks made.

So tell me - what serious boozer drinks Budweiser? How many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy's bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? And what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? Not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend's tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of Elisabeth Shue's assets.<br /><br />Cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while Shue looks more like a Berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. She is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the 'tart-with-a-heart'.<br /><br />Still - I did watch it to the end, by which time I was actually laughing out loud as Shue's tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while Cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...	-4.004805885788438	-1.9345342764680646	-1.8162442786273567	-1.8006947081345066	-1.5775268376730656	-1.3188384128194333	-1.3179422370710427	-0.20506535579587984	-0.179459858193319	-0.1326653334987523	-0.12406763764269496	-0.11839937026617973	-0.09043631510867761	0.027699288964885157	0.07572739199763744	0.08223118826472334	0.16968617454215168	0.2327645811026265	0.33741938358755896	0.6035557756838735	0.6483320858766722	0.858438727324853	1.6974992873434829	2.1343077442211036	4.247184113363034	
There's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numers' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However, by the time the credits roll, there's no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the "cop side" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'Birthday Girl') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Bottom Line: it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks.	-4.55153810166322	-2.7305926692499534	-2.438241370845186	-2.411434547814664	-1.824823254501894	-1.6393708234448756	-1.61626724175697	-0.7780979051584104	-0.7631205623715545	-0.3810533438409848	-0.11627635287550975	0.022483628683625342	0.09971830110129143	0.12120328531234374	0.12757327222997597	0.2968227103884814	0.34424988555122227	0.7312319205665396	1.0193737749092864	1.1051223812347026	1.178956188758338	1.3059939742068933	1.5602050618726517	2.358347690902274	5.599148490899478	
A touching movie about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that structurally underestimate her. The issues are subtly addressed and timeless, as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in Dutch society today. This movie is a tribute to all modern women without dwelling on feminism. Not only the story is well told, the acting and the scenery are great as well.	-2.3177922703742846	-1.8279654920334822	-0.9163310010180108	-0.5056593411389305	-0.20534386061708831	-0.18715927972026056	0.0015808980172699466	0.05007917519608858	0.14813307547918844	0.21881215696314493	0.2442830832615431	0.2614929394388442	0.26355438655381097	0.34128352442055887	0.41269783034969876	0.4154127292910012	0.44848489821419135	0.4884497030236471	0.6284688571305237	0.7209113126535536	0.7776025524408671	0.818432739446631	0.9948357090490645	1.8083453175873503	2.123715562572249	
In watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a "model" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.<br /><br />I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other "famous" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't watch this, teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject.<br /><br />Many women try out for slots to compete for "Americas Next Top Model". They live together, cat fight together, cry together, get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim, "You will see me again". Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win, actually.<br /><br />This is the dream of some girls, and good for them. In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college.<br /><br />I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the "ploy" of full figured models joining the group. That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. The "full figured models" were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a "ploy" fashionatas use all the time. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew.<br /><br />But to be fair, "Americas Next Top Model" is not about "full figured" models, it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. Hence Tyra and her consistent "this was me" plugs every camera angle you can get. But then again, that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.	-7.774456103783841	-4.042468844097742	-3.449314158088059	-2.834227128270945	-2.45523779118184	-2.331376211189111	-2.1842699953702818	-0.5277922635660657	-0.33335991073990384	-0.13729950792137116	-0.10071635080056965	0.08784988533730852	0.17383746734549646	0.45340704051152075	0.5692656879023047	0.7782954850731971	0.9685947452626209	1.0062023093771832	1.2341454928483806	1.5572034449778103	1.5873880509038718	1.9632045735631365	2.1496219241638173	4.5667436847960285	9.455578988430755

Never posted anything here before, but after watching Noroi I just felt that I had to write down my thoughts about it.<br /><br />Firstly do not compare this to Blair Witch, this movie deserves far better than that! Simply put, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot!).<br /><br />I really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick, but as a documentary filmed by a reporter (i think?) named Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without spoiling to much about the plot, I can say it that it starts with Kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events, that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister.<br /><br />While the story might not be that original in itself, what really hooked me with Noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere. If you're looking for cheap scares and seat-jumping scenes this movie might not be for you. This movie is all about the mood it presents, with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense. The documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable.<br /><br />This is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the movie! Far better than in most other movies in this type of genre.<br /><br />Well enough ranting from me, I highly recommend Noroi to everyone, it is suspenseful, creepy, well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages.	-3.1822324586423347	-2.7469146855713995	-2.2069135721370734	-1.8010485164273269	-1.6547225764808482	-0.733289716938667	-0.7125348311138855	-0.4327998834796609	-0.17027907366913875	0.042833093854690356	0.25202673222538674	0.27289194127932936	0.5439724518608102	0.6638984209741532	0.687257472043	0.8684598634650729	0.9298595980475324	0.961494820836278	1.0897873383051988	1.1595938016514884	1.2279328213384004	1.4039778155882305	2.8806059930455032	3.3631532452262083	4.129131573743994	
Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show I very highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different. I am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV so if i want to see it I have to buy the DVDs and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time (which is highly depressing). However this program is very very good and is a must see, but be warned it is highly addictive. So in summery I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).	-3.42310693637986	-2.6511244178801134	-1.5056540857575071	-1.3128131938555758	-1.3120691344170177	-0.5938275591715771	-0.2114541457549472	-0.1573340959515761	-0.05907877516013906	0.027570253488683014	0.485765717333868	0.5105407724446729	0.7440552857918167	0.7701774001527734	0.7733665416770085	0.7781110399960711	0.8329805430006072	1.0221734810367633	1.0647698761643876	1.1087007216238396	1.121934671705393	1.320210866970898	1.637503209293003	1.7822264262738314	3.237885437363774	
I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments. It's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre. Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters' behavior often strains belief. I'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/TV/literature/life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even). Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point. It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it doesn't really pay off.	-3.757348115839065	-1.8551010869812141	-1.8007426927091443	-1.5826015498188195	-1.5213517274985526	-1.1828581000324514	-0.7822794764260469	-0.5621751604534646	-0.46835785348228776	-0.3556556780478682	-0.31961922822952493	-0.1503574290577724	-0.08496244912135738	-0.06984915164272966	-0.014829237303476406	0.11745658135788703	0.25758726546537447	0.29997655148746327	0.5772100031933394	0.6321057753150112	0.6725778013335149	0.7265900692491768	1.126106442231378	2.289413781215821	4.057349126422878	
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. <br /><br />We don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script let him down. And how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bath.	-5.093926099147858	-2.60132784861852	-2.4108405499294743	-2.337699305490767	-2.1473555267056743	-1.1083686975311962	-0.6895757894213399	-0.6294066742692058	-0.2534555238400034	-0.18516014189005808	-0.15887472921040055	0.0058885360512036244	0.09636173556372057	0.1384329075743809	0.19069281235959706	0.20083362031926683	0.31003998925879556	0.4031286668614514	0.5824748101760046	0.9571604481724131	1.013000837709971	1.032776816000187	1.4673669439711154	2.878867906307814	5.4291105622957625	
I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but i found this show to be not funny at all. The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about! I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters. The "fresh of the boat" dad, who doesn't understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress), and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor, i only see him getting better).<br /><br />it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well. there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed, and don't really care to watch another episode.<br /><br />I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does, too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities!	-4.554336082861749	-2.3852292678492786	-2.3794498446298116	-2.2651853062602187	-2.2304233073361046	-1.3564185096480466	-1.0198604548526937	-0.39486947381493787	-0.33852973404920605	-0.32020436926286155	-0.2760746314448289	-0.24591170436041276	0.3107730706906047	0.32658913811612034	0.36044083346654304	0.3953466840513008	0.4803910298684386	0.5576222250666925	0.6357882514008344	0.6998616329050127	0.9165374069523825	1.065957303209067	1.3492816544598123	3.143297690748301	5.6096316735821405	
Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But, they remain as boring as they were before. Arguably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "Rich and Strange" by ordering up some camera trickery. An opening homage to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is the highlight. The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat.<br /><br />*** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph	-3.210597596318796	-1.616442545540803	-1.303618970569249	-1.2512870906722315	-1.1128658017030248	-0.6995610106646514	-0.38490583595695516	-0.37854573203841274	-0.25431596317865657	-0.18799789699711225	-0.08360526982710748	-0.07456626537478334	0.23581504956775964	0.2638828181910013	0.3042038618569647	0.30751765920841717	0.3817588910845062	0.39755382006815004	0.44268980297276306	0.44397254433077865	0.5721113252945276	0.8800279941404587	1.189629908369608	1.6213914893055579	3.483256709040258	
Lets enter the world of this movie for a second, so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here.<br /><br />Edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50,000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars, shouting at them, and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him......instead of wasting this guy that has caused you SO MUCH grief....instead of just walking up and POP!.....What do you do? The bad guy.....he talks to him. He grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun. THEY HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT! SHOOT HIM! SHOOT HIM NOW! But he talks to him anyway. Oh another thing. At the end, a newspaper says "PULITZER PRIZE WINNER STORY RIGHT HERE" or something right above on a front page of a paper, when its like the first time the story is printed. So how in the heezy did someone win a Pulitzer for it that fast? Yea, you know those types of stupid movies? Yea well that's Edison in a nutshell.<br /><br />You get Mr cool Morgan Freeman and shifty eyed tough Kevin Spacey who both phone in their roles completely, LL Cool J who scowls literally every single moment of the movie,while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places,and who's last line "Duck" was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made... and Justin Timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks, little cocky bastard.The only bright spot was a crazy Dylan McDermott doing his best "Denzel from Training Day" impression, which was pretty entertaining.<br /><br />Oh yea so whats the movie about? Eh, something about scandals involving the city Edison's fictional special unit police force called "F.R.A.T. (I swear I'm not making this stuff up) which was supposed to be a obvious play off of S.W.A.T. Anyway little journalistic super singer boy Justin Timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from FRAT, and he goes scurrying off looking for a story, gaining his boss' (Freeman) trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought. blah blah blah. Its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day.The pacing was slow and off, the script was horrible, and the acting was extremely uninspired. It jumped everywhere without going anywhere. People get put in comas and you forget about them. Everyone in this movie just didn't THINK. Damn what a stupid movie. Its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended...No lie Basically, do NOT waste your time!	-9.673821101588429	-5.8550072268361895	-4.39409675684916	-4.347477632763194	-3.664326043594339	-2.2158672422561945	-1.9283124807249457	-1.5227948416576214	-1.1542348664121134	-0.6254240608955971	-0.5840283452068209	-0.5181481768577247	-0.5120248854331283	-0.4687786722561821	-0.3506871620764725	-0.11198831014206415	0.06754844301953045	0.30932219525851734	1.6053042573306455	2.043518308667415	2.5273601492853026	2.747548024314723	3.0747363138535233	5.303588654315419	10.107301039652821

I had no idea what the film is about before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that "It is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback".<br /><br />After watching it, I understood that why their wasn't a proper trailer because there wasn't anything in the film to show. The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story-line. There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it's difficult to figure out that who is killing who. Also the action was daft & unrealistic e.g. 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns.<br /><br />While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of 3 films:<br /><br />Sin City: During the opening credits.<br /><br />Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla.<br /><br />Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny.<br /><br />I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I don't know where all the money went to. Anyway if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.<br /><br />The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English couldn't save this discomfiture.	-8.169588093791292	-3.9208544343884757	-3.782084920653924	-3.4178938606611884	-3.1478643689246346	-2.0695709841568974	-1.080802183416772	-1.0401726589321394	-1.0010319571954056	-0.7879532168127592	-0.43083566523059835	-0.3359701156741576	-0.05603445782774069	0.1283277668831213	0.1669227025609006	0.18206135787190153	0.5943782817613329	0.8526846235238796	1.2661646699406441	1.2680769510844598	1.2865805346609	1.6702574730777988	2.6843622465107093	4.207816293911032	8.336947020195108	
The movie started off strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from the Practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise.<br /><br />The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former. Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. Everything he did in this film was unconvincing.<br /><br />Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.<br /><br />That aside there are a few plot holes, such as Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery. This movie had so much promise. Thoroughly disappointing.	-5.7854201518856705	-2.967919895891501	-2.476415187943941	-2.0504321702987705	-1.9113562184302735	-1.5366167016874772	-1.066706172395387	-0.6140679006034315	-0.5808129570138043	-0.5508118303663123	-0.2669830208278744	-0.10665154420183139	0.024290485801783255	0.09039601163015976	0.16803928721056544	0.4793443189555532	0.5686940287861052	0.8664888879475854	0.9739802626075824	1.1174863798638666	1.2267166465131696	1.2633012244810353	1.308784505736969	3.3818469239263607	6.233387095940011	
I really didn't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from Parkersburg WV, which is were I live, acting in it. This town is dull and so is this film. There were a few decent scened in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show. This movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn't any. Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie. The dialog will put you to sleep, the acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this. Its a predictable movie with no surprises. What you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.	-5.27577858861124	-2.616905536353536	-2.521525006596055	-2.460728100749411	-2.1952456122273443	-1.87486629079446	-0.9407234487711553	-0.824113284768341	-0.6714419383497549	-0.49709795492004094	-0.49283954299264016	-0.47986331856945824	-0.39821568318098216	-0.3515575543475246	0.04578414535571359	0.21845990580257277	0.2428711460886466	0.43753991771556805	0.4862600546655641	0.8851356697076666	1.006808746156224	1.0688956208764144	2.128894869819814	2.7050069217309187	5.568782128918906	
I absolutely LOVED this film! I do not at all relate to all the other comments I have read about it. I was COMPLETELY enthralled through every second! <br /><br />I found the story gripping, the acting intense, and the direction spot-on. I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie. Even though there was nothing "scary" about the story itself, I was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening. <br /><br />I found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it. There were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.	-2.3120275113672397	-1.5012341248957979	-1.4927134837751905	-0.9944273129829555	-0.7614995257281922	-0.5756579126721382	-0.42908672970876527	-0.19505778938299653	-0.19010861999455228	-0.17489984165235456	-0.14837122687650842	0.21723842180821684	0.2970915400464268	0.49264403182549305	0.5070506341419079	0.545857869553477	0.6314064323277564	0.6327636130128234	0.6350317904536524	0.7275222431885615	0.978329638973571	1.4098554228120896	2.094272595892586	2.54787737570038	2.945532199127537	
En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).	-4.837275609909743	-3.137241802789914	-3.121240955764962	-2.8220277572301793	-2.6036974636719976	-1.176238930006405	-0.8398240980731733	-0.8267301820494296	-0.5914609211088364	-0.5433500149091155	-0.40219627669373154	-0.35842372357872654	-0.12594905389799138	-0.11422528182896119	0.02539695695473581	0.04778674568030079	0.24598221429424894	0.39382596554404814	0.5553806699419287	0.8075602733960796	1.000269807207345	1.236541098085528	1.6871159860893064	2.9591784155599568	4.994104037821881	
Loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors in it. But, for me Ms. Davis' very poor attempt at an accent, and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch. Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms. Davis they would be laughed off the screen.<br /><br />I really think she 'phoned this one in'. Now if it had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the part of the wife I would have enjoyed it much more.<br /><br />I guess I just don't 'get' Bette Davis. I've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in. The possible exception is Now Voyager.<br /><br />I'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful (and I hope civil) detail how I am totally wrong on this. But, I'll continue to watch the movies she's in because I like the stories/writing/supporting casts, but, I'll always be thinking, of different actresses that could have done a better job.	-2.4147178405509893	-2.1615227784798283	-2.144377659657486	-1.4575139737498994	-1.2406513459636708	-0.6428741155698553	-0.6406744777369477	-0.6101140412346906	-0.59045625393916	-0.513139676951677	-0.42931699787545013	-0.17874905472952884	-0.0787832178002329	0.14936097408628418	0.27365430538088514	0.448446662360628	0.4628236506671639	0.6036914038111021	0.716626579854639	0.7812880320415643	0.8617744068529797	0.8672852638809022	2.1193150591237684	2.3396667944423326	3.5532025809403947	
As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale, I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been.<br /><br />THE BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator.<br /><br />The dialog is insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is real garbage-mouth. From what I read, there were several directors replacing each other on this film, and that's too bad. You can tell things aren't right with the story. I couldn't get "involved" with Treat Williams' portrayal of Cooper, either. He should have been fascinating, but he wasn't in this movie. It's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of "folk hero," but I admit I wound up rooting for the guy, too.<br /><br />Not everything was disappointing. I can't complain about the scenery, from the lush, green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona.<br /><br />I'd like to see this movie re-made and done better, because it is a one-of-a-kind story.	-5.2098548288538105	-2.451608316653444	-2.4514729155939143	-2.2749165643406215	-2.2392444258346442	-1.534681055578615	-1.5101567959931765	-0.3997399522441848	-0.17492618374878877	-0.13766940240869152	-0.11121679728159217	-0.07488275011216171	-0.03206664358458109	-0.013785967243899832	0.42938852662189764	0.48051371876267107	0.4819327716856135	0.5934099765086217	0.7348551058056132	0.7387655681751804	0.8605579630369469	0.8754527738642217	1.5882052265785234	3.257137397665377	6.323211035003709	
"Summer of My German Soldier" was one of the many TV movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were "Brian's Song", "Sybil" and "Someone's Watching Me!"). It portrays a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) befriending a German POW (Bruce Davison) in WWII-era Georgia. One of the things that the movie shows is that many of the German soldiers weren't really Nazis, but were just drafted. Watching the movie, I got a real sense of how things must have been in the South back then; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /><br />So, I certainly recommend this movie. I believe that it's always important to show the things portrayed here. Occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do quite well. I hope that the movie eventually comes out on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" patriarch).	-1.7694929310117988	-1.0929766196827708	-1.088281467778145	-1.0411692620470787	-0.7876029165050543	-0.5926315931783799	-0.35854242573371287	-0.3444050793306717	-0.19292486011409715	-0.16878765743216667	-0.06043389209012508	-0.04170026211506581	0.09442587951103548	0.17005255643949313	0.2327537154001502	0.2522833801899481	0.28742716659540907	0.2907615341606152	0.2966168644534827	0.47391010520126386	0.5209784465103748	0.6166153941164793	1.0973000126148984	1.1905026430550258	1.9312476920481587	
Millions in gold is traveling by train to the US treasury. Traveling along is Lois Lane to report on it. Along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves. They detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones. This leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves. The thieves overpower them but then Lois Lane jumps in. She beats the thieves off the train (at one point using a gun) but the train starts to careen out of control. Lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold. Good thing Superman is on the way!<br /><br />Fast, exciting, non-stop action. Probably one of the best of all the cartoons. Just great.	-2.2583116978517763	-2.0441012557302765	-1.3307827717742955	-1.287597789086479	-0.7050082037430785	-0.6792432780986515	-0.3223845226703541	-0.26340063548470705	-0.22646141319113586	-0.2206455402038835	-0.20772500517470532	-0.20443293917713337	0.001138737824448871	0.018135913597456713	0.060628589438831884	0.19692386316547744	0.20782875237375203	0.22253241508429783	0.7886221790478871	1.071547312352155	1.6844098376472882	1.8082987992437614	1.9722553290547087	2.3124235351011397	3.590715477401094	
My wife and I watch a film every night with no distractions, and mostly artsy films that require thought. I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom. My wife has double the attention span that I do. All that being said-- this film is just plain empty and BORING! It went nowhere. Never blossomed. It started fairly strong with a promising plot...then she bakes cookies...goes to Spain....she sulks, she stares....the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts & dead ends. We FF'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space. Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz...... It's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy. You never get to know nor understand Morvern at all. About halfway through you just don't care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop. Don't waste your time on this. I'm shocked it scores so high.	-4.840792656490134	-3.241735181589351	-3.185801154214536	-2.3583945384380174	-1.745784909688182	-1.5924256029482677	-1.3471115886494427	-0.604604218655439	-0.24394621903384595	-0.14500203770495418	-0.14439998642850588	-0.11509459553754325	-0.044049357667612976	0.027367287639611992	0.21048328071564623	0.2564177538129858	0.32017034884155865	0.5643647023617109	0.9822821749861107	1.3568839152242262	1.5850338333136609	1.7088279625322038	2.1005175338950908	3.8903269686364825	6.980331798395432	
James Stewart plays Dr. Ben McKenna, who, with his wife and son, are tourists in an Arabian city. They get caught up in the middle of a murder scene. The victim whispers something in Dr. McKenna's ear, and he is told to do something.<br /><br />Later, his son is kidnapped. The kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew, but the woman is a bit softer than the man.<br /><br />The song, "Que, Sera, Sera" (Whatever we'll be, we'll be," is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie.<br /><br />Doris Day play's Stewart's wife, and she sings the song mentioned above. Her performance is Oscar worthy. I'm surprised she wasn't even nominated.<br /><br />My Score: 8/10.	-1.7348605270781183	-1.682620470087787	-0.9232602484232748	-0.8030898050018044	-0.6826656927583795	-0.5695762694964975	-0.5609251455156525	-0.16425889243002573	-0.029815897578335138	-0.014207382234885949	0.052734175311111256	0.16511729545588624	0.20419992690136218	0.27357160759174154	0.3028299833653379	0.37744793358474354	0.39346597753942647	0.6025258763801961	0.6396467988921132	0.6602124377924987	0.7305072924987616	0.8455610671152319	1.3077718117955308	1.409161238626063	2.977274107131128	
This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years. Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.<br /><br />The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest. The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , I just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining <br /><br />The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison ,Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible time)<br /><br />If you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie, some people actually did enjoyed this movie but I like to watch a movie with meaning	-2.663408338919505	-1.7947764345770754	-1.7477947037251538	-1.4132516259132402	-1.3475685814780116	-1.1711099326804437	-0.7166194991621677	-0.707838999015619	-0.3402322529311213	-0.31813186437294805	0.009570449841876591	0.09483537431685844	0.13896191326817056	0.16885794496182072	0.24572060395291961	0.30521276910506406	0.3456803741829111	0.3854003449012879	0.4390312554849354	0.5582139077705763	0.5904658511037129	0.8866494405176764	0.982444256877556	2.0842766420324623	3.54277061885597	
Alfred Hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it certainly isn't a bad film, he does appear to be right. That being said, this remake, although definitely better, still isn't among Hitchcock's best work. That's certainly not to say that it isn't good, it's just more than a little overindulgent, and that drags it down. Hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out, and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. Some of these dragged out sequences, such as the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our American protagonists have found themselves in, but for every restaurant scene, there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse.<br /><br />The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife that go to Morocco for a holiday with their young son. While there, they meet a French man on the bus and another middle-aged couple in a restaurant. However, things go awry when the French man dies from a knife in the back, shortly after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, which causes them to cut it short and go to London in order to try and find him. The film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it, and it manages to hold this all the way through. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that Hitchcock ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's films, this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. There is also more than a little humour in the movie, which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on, and actually works quite well.<br /><br />The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic Peter Lorre. This film doesn't benefit from his presence, unfortunately, but that is made up for by performances from the amazing James Stewart, and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the 'greatest actor of all time' crown. His collaborations with Hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him, and this one is no different. (Although his best performance remains the one in Mr Smith Goes to Washington). Stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly. In fact, that's one of the best things about this film; you are really able to feel for the couple's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling. Doris Day, on the other hand, is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. She's definitely a good actress, but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd (even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little).<br /><br />As I've mentioned; this is not Hitchcock's best film, but there's much to enjoy about it and although I'd recommend many Hitchcock films before recommending this one, I'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well.	-4.871900654295317	-3.6427435659816374	-3.4760330792397074	-3.198782179978042	-1.6532807400013252	-1.4096889800906613	-1.3443113447823354	-0.33613447646800965	-0.2744301492660224	0.14866528951138114	0.22463179575728076	0.24351507572617193	0.3598215510987155	0.507483575050698	0.5365899222733886	0.6824854787745059	0.8923908063427257	1.179469859465005	1.784348078824637	2.108900972733616	2.255190864914797	3.7690169436472756	5.202253107627305	5.690913557235526	8.277220337881428	
Some less than inspired opening string music notwithstanding, we somehow know that from the word go this is heading straight for the "big fun" drawer. By the time we observe Monica Dolan (in a truly genius bit of casting) delightfully goofing it up as Cora early on we're already hooked, but it is only later on when she reveals herself in her marvellous screen creation, that deranged, scheming, maleficent queen of murder and deceit posing in the guise of the uptight Miss Gilchrist, that she not only effortlessly steals the entire telemovie for herself but quite simply blows off screen anyone who comes near her, including the ever well measured David Suchet who himself seems to be somewhat bedazzled by her acting talents and, very gentlemanly, allows her to take centre stage. Dolan is the true engine of the film and her Miss Gilchrist a genuinely well rounded character in this Christie rendition, helped by a zesty script and the sprightly paced direction - and also by the rest of the cast led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott, who all display signs of sympathy for the given material and play with relish accordingly.<br /><br />The production values are spot on as usual, and if there are any weaker links they might be located in the comparatively substandard music score to the majority of later Poirots, and also perhaps in the lacking of a genuine Italian-born actor for the role of Cora's husband. Other than that, this is an hour and a half of pure televisual delight which is as self indulgent and entertaining as it is lovingly put together.	-1.4694249114183888	-1.0902306144568812	-0.7958947982444111	-0.6544632489364721	-0.5913087618697995	-0.29506331193065427	-0.14891498674821507	-0.10013858404976239	-0.09548976132851952	0.040413022589280506	0.09530838866045935	0.11968580751422495	0.1471252942097807	0.16499506366977665	0.17544977869728756	0.19181284749678612	0.32428944643352486	0.4154138539537571	0.4258965138002687	0.697672662392963	0.7844213235094541	0.8316339588799095	1.0296593814936021	1.3025940485193634	1.7700547570502494	
While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop.<br /><br />Amongst the many inconsistencies: <br /><br />* Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb, chasuble or surplice. Academic robes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests. <br /><br />* Jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons. He attributes it to St. Paul. This verse is not from St. Paul's writings, neither is it in the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. <br /><br />* Jacob tells his bishop he doesn't believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete 180 (later that same day?) within minutes of talking to possessed Isabelle. Sure, it's possible; but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest/psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a bit more realistic portrayal of a skeptic-turned-believer. <br /><br />* Miguel, the former priest turned farmhand, is the first to try an exorcism on Isabelle. He quotes scripture, and she quotes back. He says "I see you know Psalm 65" - she corrects him "that's Psalm 67" - they're both wrong. <br /><br />* Miguel, the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism - making the sign of the cross, calling on the name of Christ, applying holy water, etc. - tells Jacob he doesn't believe in church and he doesn't believe in God. (Maybe he's just conflicted?) Jacob enlists him to put on home-made vestments and have another go at it anyway. <br /><br />* Miguel, the former ROMAN CATHOLIC priest, crosses himself backwards (or Eastern Orthodox-style). As an Hispanic Roman Catholic who USED to be a priest, he should've crossed himself forehead to sternum, left-side to right side of chest.<br /><br />I had to read into the little side stories to get the notion Satan was messing with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery (except for the sheriff - it's pretty clear he was guilty).<br /><br />On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot twist with Claire.<br /><br />I'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoof.<br /><br />Listening to the running commentary with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I'm inclined to believe it was a joke.	-11.256686065935899	-5.646013398893109	-5.533564678276482	-5.225488462276583	-5.125183712055924	-2.071859997684941	-1.3594022188359673	-1.3165124009622318	-1.016344640672825	-0.9713431126564989	-0.8303906826416487	-0.25347816888666025	-0.08204991223500883	-0.066607068132056	0.40296521343075153	0.6078661226627816	0.6753333630789474	1.5128704630698795	1.6641674071050825	1.8038201602267516	2.1197361955370138	2.342104411622733	3.0112851392175974	6.183363435676291	12.32620012961993

Unless you're interested in seeing 2 hours worth of scenic mountain footage featuring hysterical characters, lots of histrionics and cheap 70s gore (not much of it either), I would advise to avoid this movie. It is long winded, overlong and has a rather annoying amateurish feel to it. Masterpiece? No, an average thriller, shot in an average fashion, in a gorgeous Italian landscape. <br /><br />I'm a huge fan of slow paced 1970 movies, when there is a plot to delight and entertain you. In this case, it didn't work out for me. The plot is trite, interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters, backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical Italian widow dressed all in black, sobbing.<br /><br />If you are not acquainted and familiar with the Italy country side, the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking. This movie isn't however, nothing out of the ordinary, there are much better Italian horror flicks than this. Not much else than a yawn fest. 5/10	-4.093161987276517	-2.539133601864448	-2.501281079633003	-2.3009643842209324	-2.168737009693701	-1.7449928578732046	-1.1926291768030979	-0.6587352400445823	-0.03524830251172339	-0.006199037768589998	-3.341657048480714E-4	0.07557712284613352	0.16150899395047844	0.27884266656470674	0.36244240157924557	0.44451743313421027	0.5009740518413609	0.5196308633667245	0.7418759395554926	0.8651974839925161	1.0379706017477	1.2554929498513265	1.3281740593261093	2.97834141455435	5.674707557276696	
An enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. And without that, nada. The sub-plots bore no relation that I could see to the main plot - all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which surely suggests a fundamental flaw. When all your sub-plots look like padding, you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits. Nevertheless, it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place, there are some fine performances, and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final 'cut!' That good feeling permeates the film. And that has to count for something. A flawed really quite good movie. 7 out of 10.	-2.6418147459952617	-2.2261350103965665	-2.1799814709561867	-1.7231358026617758	-1.0830752947290225	-0.9581889735204303	-0.7386272476935435	-0.4331812540847606	-0.35272216864287564	-0.05027775376837463	0.030040018194399817	0.12491649122713319	0.1502381291275516	0.17015837219064345	0.19620301651177233	0.19664286233598172	0.33778929373672983	0.5541048101124613	0.6064961300681231	1.2661284270273274	1.299123393853969	2.2819867525037316	2.563948022376012	3.0085203517420287	5.4462158172520665	
The Night Listener held my attention, with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very ill. Williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone. However, Williams' ex-boyfriend (nice job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubt about the boy, which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I will leave it at that. Toni Collette also stars.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrayal of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also starred as Williams' friend. The Night Listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout. At times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but I liked it anyway. I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me.

The mystery here is why this delightful, small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves. Simply showcasing the budding talent of Audrey Tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti. <br /><br />Lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations, itÕs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and, unlike some of itsÕ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre, such as The Taste of Others, it actually entertains.	-1.0304788860642256	-0.7517852289413636	-0.7403391971481426	-0.492784820923318	-0.3215685933896846	-0.26448675301551294	-0.2360407530595387	-0.21572640053798586	-0.12671999028205705	-0.10123029840248159	-0.0736376271355502	0.021520728497983088	0.0223154589931715	0.03594973096060727	0.05893644494452285	0.1598507294435169	0.1626575943923953	0.17403771009953095	0.3027934090531459	0.3057517707043162	0.39869823094427637	0.42678682245409416	0.548464171546873	1.03023580866593	1.4209520970383847	
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.<br /><br />I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, it all went horribly wrong.<br /><br />I could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none here. I am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter, but Netflix pushed this movie as a UFO skeptic and a UFO believer investigating multiple sitings.<br /><br />I stopped watching about half way thru. Can't believe I wasted that much time with this one. Please don't make the same mistake I did.	-4.716738525309165	-2.100714960356667	-1.9534526858043455	-1.945868178922123	-1.7625334329211875	-1.7042231482753314	-1.4104874828339495	-0.43647840229653195	-0.39532156574480704	-0.18405708696663198	-0.15131105288202454	0.0010197634111410378	0.10132442401840068	0.12030222353958692	0.2170412111422435	0.22821392250738004	0.2352198661477742	0.5038575525604768	0.5583223027917312	0.6864722271339052	0.712324580556568	0.8431451787565902	1.9103307995112297	2.4503031135720774	5.286595723251085	
In my work with the only nationwide non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc. dedicated exclusively to the issue of college campus crime prevention and student awareness I see all too often the type of campus violence and `cover-up' through secret campus courts portrayed in the movie `Silencing Mary.' In fact we receive numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters such as `Mary' who are facing similar situations.<br /><br />Its depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade by `Mary,' the victim's roommate and a student journalist played exceedingly well by Melissa Joan Hart, for justice was very well done and accurately researched.<br /><br />This was the first television movie that I have ever seen that I felt truly reflected and encompassed all of the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our nation's college and university campuses. Although it would not be possible to address all of these issues in depth in 2 hours, this movie comes closer than any others I've seen.	-1.2803752218645694	-0.6781468741544463	-0.6678842379142704	-0.6077598601671876	-0.5614094779579645	-0.4712817361198696	-0.4362647940355997	-0.3211429833357439	-0.12744344849476438	-0.08702772282802872	0.07919571079754509	0.09113898885149271	0.11622467644763625	0.1319137749701986	0.1523806295535418	0.17627037863510595	0.22631890893818746	0.24449526677876252	0.26944286740213874	0.39342529832436524	0.44239146763508924	0.8317418609529668	0.8736604921598394	1.29252683840864	1.77292719008872	
Pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying "pussy" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calling women "pussy" is just awkward... What the hell were the people behind this film thinking? Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable.<br /><br />I rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked.	-4.252551314724827	-2.8556915479613196	-2.6814383621777003	-2.620330141597247	-2.4165721869887635	-1.356387496634336	-1.0452990333714522	-0.6403766358718841	-0.49268396060373076	-0.47959600323007207	-0.4090623336249243	-0.23712415226412575	-0.14254319652557274	-0.0945951442995349	0.02624787058434789	0.11950710244343785	0.22395218300853892	0.263159101296321	0.30339290572146643	0.44138822643570746	0.6854765738024798	1.2303638660179517	1.5908959343147508	2.660957131625449	4.371474744229041	
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice. you are just a big fony hypocrite.	-2.1873997159791854	-2.0357606811530116	-1.2683182200166663	-0.8331257074109251	-0.832944435834069	-0.5298895509498165	-0.5071397259338966	-0.20725271984971944	-0.15049179095739856	-0.05130456721969377	0.03221814770398708	0.050719650175771014	0.10988551737837207	0.12208229666055151	0.15261161399651915	0.3320987596485916	0.3550408949801439	0.3826409372425426	0.3894581472228001	0.46562842308500907	0.4937839695779638	0.5962391944016487	1.18801508062812	1.2818174545164158	2.5698832704445724	
A horribly pointless and, worse, boring film. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes, and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way. <br /><br />Will Ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and substitutes his usual shouting routine (admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights) for, well, pretty much nothing. <br /><br />Emma Thompson is no more than mildly irritating (that some reviews I've read here are talking her up for an Oscar nomination is laughable) whilst Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy. Please. That she ended up falling for Ferrell's 'character' is utterly ludicrous.<br /><br />Marc Forster's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with.<br /><br />I had the choice of either going to watch The Prestige for the third time or seeing this. I wish I'd opted for The Prestige.	-5.946665052100964	-3.54299277047068	-3.3276290757783675	-3.2867134872267734	-2.9706679809921535	-0.9075034792107043	-0.8456881039158132	-0.7271591187825046	-0.6690523359602518	-0.6146104674875188	-0.38135567297892964	-0.3527422033226743	-0.30028912490064535	-0.1563687682878953	-0.06913766436601568	0.10303028659937136	0.14231620627690544	0.24094935216966787	0.5571103851619137	0.741202808324503	0.9114011507469862	1.2365953013254662	2.124221481500739	3.023420571912979	5.650245799021344	
I loved the first season. The quality went down a little bit in the second season, which however had a great middle (Pegasus!). Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK. Fourth season started going downhill fast, because they never even began giving us any explanations, when by now we were really starting to need them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara leading the fleet to a devastated Earth-1? What kind of a past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they survive, or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere.<br /><br />And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Well, okay. But destroying the fleet?! Giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life, and spreading a few thousand people paper-thinly across the planet?! That's not only anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive A.I. that ruins everything. It is without vision, without hope for a grander future for humanity, and it is antithetical to proper science fiction. And don't even get me started on the angels! Religious claptrap of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment!!<br /><br />The whole "all this has happened before and will happen again" thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to Earth as we know it. Making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius. Frakkin shame.<br /><br />1 out of 10.	-8.059077317643988	-4.4246848313398575	-3.4166312641865506	-2.4816046936587166	-2.1738934573423667	-2.067503624629525	-1.5541926332040263	-0.9470798103427238	-0.6683174260967469	-0.4251040662266581	-0.18313071681768767	0.03744895089861039	0.06069141794359237	0.1309719439355761	0.3694451864117504	0.7578538070433076	1.1181460295440622	1.1989453650425639	1.4690679224039769	1.599241617055117	1.6311575656305677	1.6544947286179148	1.946036683670104	4.9343310102910145	9.474405587219001	
I just watched Nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago, and while I remember liking it at the time, I don't remember being blown away by it like I was today. I really can't complain about anything in this movie. Craig Scheffer is excellent as the lead character of Boone. I never understood why he hasn't had a more successful career, because most of his early work is outstanding. As good as Scheffer is, Cronenberg is even better. His portrayal of the psycho Dr. Decker is unforgettable, and steals the show. The rest of the cast, which includes Doug Bradley is very good, save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff. The visuals are good, and in some shots great. The Danny Elfman composed score is as good as it gets, and is among his best work. The ending was epic, with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes. Overall, Nightbreed is a tremendous accomplishment for Clive Barker, and ranks as my favorite of his movies, just slightly ahead of Hellraiser. 9/10	-5.782542798203433	-4.45826203796215	-2.6491328988694907	-1.5294076202238536	-1.3037827276893426	-0.5324483659652212	0.2915076148809089	0.3274504605101441	0.40928276384957846	0.4256160438610679	0.5880579389309378	0.783109175558321	0.9969650711215176	1.1712213169278543	1.2146341724025238	1.4497117049714998	1.4628582981663245	1.5547581161839	1.5560696496751834	2.052249949587137	2.2738422910933798	2.9934728469271428	3.167860680643923	3.8284016112770294	5.926647260549789	
I only recently found out that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD. The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several times.<br /><br />Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well cast, with a likable (if too pretty) Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /><br />The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene. Unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead) and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. Mrs Whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here. I could go on and on, nearly every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.<br /><br />This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films. What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it's sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.	-6.0869081931979965	-3.350177483112856	-3.2355707038775408	-3.075370899830472	-2.9493762942180837	-1.6230675933769272	-0.9274816333740061	-0.6593257107341425	-0.5992068945420722	-0.4754583423269375	-0.31031736113932906	-0.20820350190057685	0.253634469313161	0.4121289826505789	0.4735471601037206	0.6345050193494197	0.7222285054087453	0.8211202539879501	0.8438442740165275	0.99556109119869	1.1315691065960671	1.221079792113086	1.6210993467241757	3.802434917913626	7.4111340328055695	
I haven't always been a fan, but the show grew on me. It wasn't until after season 5 that I started to see the richness of the show. They finally brought Daniel Jackson's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the Go,ould System Lords were killed by rival Lords, SG-1 or others.<br /><br />Towards Season 5, Stargate SG-1, was beginning to become stale. With the new writers and the close attention by Produer Peter Deleuise, the show became more and more solid.<br /><br />The characters had become stale as well. Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with O'Neill's weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to Abydos in order to face off with the Go'ould RA. The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in.<br /><br />Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job. Though this character had little area to grow, Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on Carter's strengths. She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently. <br /><br />Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Teal'c. Teal'c was an alien called the Jaffa. Infant Go'ould, (snake like creatures) would embed themselves into the Jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form. The Jaffa would die. Teal'c was the First Prime of Apophis' army. Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Go'ould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy. Finally, having had enough, he and Jack O'Neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people. After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the Go'ould. Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character. Teal'c is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bra'tac. The show would not be complete without Master Bra'tac played by Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. In the end, he became adviser to most of SG-1, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /><br />Don S. Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand. Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal. He does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. You can really say, he is the anchor of the base. Simply, I would die for that man. If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world. He will go himself. He doesn't leave anyone behind.<br /><br />I saved Dr. Daniel Jackson for last, because this character, I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on. In choosing Shanks I don't think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson, they don't talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks. In the early years, the Jackson character came off as a whiner. That's why I probably wasn't a fan. As the seasons pasted, the character became stronger. This gave him confidence. In the end, as of season 10, the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero. He still monitors the groups ethics. He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward. Acheaology, History, Culture and Exploration are part of his very being. He is determined. Though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement. <br /><br />Other characters include, most recently: Vala Mal Doran(Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell(Ben Browder), new lead of SG-1. Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess. I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton (Farscape character). Black's character is simply off the wall. Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon.	-15.040206030971794	-8.990294098618175	-6.525640050863801	-6.519578452894345	-4.242213884152832	-4.200517483266092	-4.101251028484548	-3.685454110748139	-2.198340015338029	-0.8209767430652224	-0.3032722484562568	0.7784609834904481	0.8978382117809746	0.9367689234350425	0.9874255363734324	1.761318286109347	2.1689731771189877	3.0248558445651796	3.0601863608807585	3.50384868821183	3.802063161076525	4.072224390005154	6.721084624856654	9.33938167880489	19.62151214691291	
There is something about this show that keeps me watching and hoping for the future of it. In the writing, the jokes are few and far between, and the story lines are a bore, so I figure it must be the physical comedy and the visuals.<br /><br />I do enjoy the camera movement, set dressing, and wardrobe. It's amusingly highly contrasted against the dullness that reigns. And I'm pretty sure every time I have laughed it was because of John or Molly's physical comedy. The two of them make a sickeningly cute couple that make me laugh and want to puke at the same time.<br /><br />So here I go ready to sit down to Kath & Kim one more time tonight to see what path this production will go down (or up as the case may be, looking forward positively).	-2.0988040567483113	-1.4177658513426314	-1.333469099277229	-1.1663780069762542	-0.8481582129753129	-0.6732569174175941	-0.5367983827644381	-0.40422638421197843	-0.3317765445923699	-0.27907963546327347	-0.2635894874852976	-0.251489339061611	-0.24314884060785202	0.11150989341111471	0.25652536447924085	0.33653932357390737	0.3899731068613162	0.4532518898023369	0.473157830327604	0.5593094575693649	0.6315668353871287	0.9166208299510333	1.5936029291018967	1.8537061536746	2.1996775439466894	
Melvyn Douglas once more gives a polished performance in which, this time, he inhabits the role of a detective who can't place love before duty and adventure, and the warmly beautiful Joan Blondell (who, far from being illiterate, as one reviewer suggested, wrote a novel about her early life) is as enjoyable as ever as his ever-suffering sweetheart.It's almost a screwball comedy, almost a Thin Man-type movie, almost a series, I guess, that didn't quite make it to a sequel. It doesn't quite reach classic status, but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script, fine character actors, and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don't notice that Williams (Douglas) isn't exactly Columbo when it comes to detecting. I wish there were more films like this.	-0.6080585536623242	-0.4542245654389211	-0.4407155528483424	-0.41408207611529113	-0.3105293707480891	-0.21451377911000605	-0.19679692752476755	-0.18690927547372388	-0.10277250524065432	-0.07154511914328629	-0.046162129559338766	-0.02701225026971027	-0.021947891205354834	-0.007450068003620438	0.03266449309891237	0.06885032650199116	0.0827921889973966	0.09410375316387341	0.11287551122282458	0.17646656219741336	0.4299997240625137	0.5401586461141724	0.5559931692440432	0.5828375133668434	1.2138444497972039	
Firstly, I am not easily scared by... Anything except for my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrific. This is not appropriate for children at all! I had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me I. Couldn't believe how gory it was for a children's movie, bunnies being brutally murdered! It's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated G. I recommend being over 8 to see this. But don't get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I wasn't scarred mentally as a child. I cannot believe a parent would allow a, let's say, 4 year old child to watch this. It's just to intense and complicated, not to forget gory, for young kids. I'm wayy over 4 and I was shocked by the violence. I don't recommend	-3.4443236889849103	-2.258200699481824	-1.5755790395413698	-1.329266468186669	-1.3173360879396157	-0.9585348932341998	-0.7554496634701626	-0.1115586451142758	-0.08144239675460421	-0.07447883019253804	0.03077325641509271	0.0335739506448497	0.04100995303094307	0.10728880601919402	0.1198386954546817	0.2800265546619532	0.3681288867305854	0.48985665976762804	0.5158016474539229	0.5478724082064571	0.7416597433193562	0.838923148601927	1.3699933419376606	2.3470315206964636	4.574122595317724	
Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus.?<br /><br />Main characters: Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa the pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a boy called Louis, a girl called Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs the clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc.?<br /><br />What happens: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed some "brain grain cereal" and are now cuddly, friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children. They go into New York, with big plans<br /><br />My thoughts: This is a cute animated film. The animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not-so-good, but they look pleasant all the same that way. I like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters featured, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like the others as well. Overall, I like this film a lot! :-)<br /><br />Recommended to: People who like good children's animated films, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think that circuses aren't always what they seem Enjoy! :-)	-1.7377798433472342	-1.7144663186393423	-1.2536692707754784	-1.1506580596459186	-0.9963916585781241	-0.9876324062894506	-0.9012924369561055	-0.8105541037168301	-0.7810715384671313	-0.6378470001736849	-0.5764698907044081	-0.5296789961524915	-0.475709753763355	0.16160344989594316	0.2600881637654895	0.49759416672920337	0.5771241864448132	0.6210136450741761	0.6964864018961334	1.2996482262946685	1.9188251936828211	1.9593824879860375	2.1695072713049135	2.637382606432254	3.4499553505652205	
I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.<br /><br />I liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. Definitely not what the DVD cover claims, "Destined to be the next stoner classic", hardly.<br /><br />Wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast.<br /><br />Almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on.

Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. She's still exploring, trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' at least something happens in this one.	-2.259992414316378	-1.1873616845745414	-0.9148739338771166	-0.7732610583813626	-0.7015073906564862	-0.5334645150793206	-0.46339430469177323	-0.4371575750630572	-0.17813104205762587	-0.1658633725844963	-0.10377305155140734	-0.07563322784755906	0.016638073565374164	0.1132821020239635	0.14819401980961472	0.22582497061535992	0.30205543356615927	0.48007395467237274	0.481063920705095	0.5333868390696812	0.613171410363416	0.9766236480706266	1.1579476965493822	1.5559154858574444	1.8240608943897523	
The first part of Grease with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John is one of the best movie for teens, This one is a very bad copy. The change is only in the sex. In the first one the good one was Sandy, here it's Michael. I prefer to watch the first Grease.	-1.510877568870634	-0.9000701950219245	-0.45819652646822506	-0.3977971367946395	-0.3341097263566211	-0.2772202744865671	-0.20256243185210393	-0.17637308297753157	-0.08448698260199244	-0.05088084115918778	-0.02313237960084963	0.004953143849386568	0.16512858480261697	0.3083472965101779	0.3188030463305046	0.33781679662694974	0.4096012793170642	0.41042959244390576	0.41899386423143753	0.42217129510274426	0.4631504437768878	0.5955030986808442	0.7972497719291368	0.8663208382944164	1.2142971402791072	
A touching story told with tenderness: awkward young Jewish girl in WWII America befriends an escaped German POW who is hiding out in her clubhouse. They discuss their lives and beliefs (he's anti-Hitler), she sneaks him food, he becomes her only friend and ally. All this reminded me of the much-better theatrical film "Whistle Down The Wind", where Hayley Mills befriends convict Alan Bates, but you certainly can't fault the direction here, which is smooth, or the performances, which are sterling. Mature in her pre-teen years, Kristy McNichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note. Suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is found out as well), the movie gets very tough. Her father, shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with "that Nazi", lays into her with a quiet fury I have seldom seen before (he tells her "You are dead to me," which must be devastating for a little girl to hear). The final scenes don't cop out; there are no big reunions, no hand-holding climaxes. The girl has to face the world, and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends, and family. A startling film.	-2.03302534783363	-1.581295487173516	-1.1151461413438324	-0.8115801451413839	-0.8087693109045171	-0.6993198734007514	-0.5025940577937413	-0.44294433890576523	-0.42672335391588323	-0.4118295666573014	-0.3419970760565233	-0.2627801153484186	-0.09070689421645613	-0.028249140617670518	0.012081684357173966	0.08189608604869857	0.14747900655611146	0.23892936539157916	0.5855546872292468	0.5926480471739642	0.9535663130437931	0.9935011483534775	1.4930658798086738	1.4962455645817159	2.690100654563901	
This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all. Generally speaking, I am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories. And this one is GREAT! Besides Meryl's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the movie's greatest asset is the story it is based on. The riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture, after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye-opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans, and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people (the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example) are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would, for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions. The other face of the so-called "civilized" society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings (needless to say, this is very general, even though this specific tale unfolds in Australia), that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty. Must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought-provoking.	-2.125072163508136	-1.9956736104425428	-1.5371582836842033	-1.232748490032995	-0.7824624342308993	-0.48125112870072656	-0.4279387200026148	-0.22281328042915752	-0.21149750343528662	-0.18214894384689198	-0.15507644316459057	0.11931496069395922	0.233096319514547	0.2990371567086929	0.34251268652765215	0.4584279479539824	0.5225563787533638	0.6292065237686999	0.6778292449926556	0.6898044554290796	0.7228677325179043	1.1674305815057602	1.640421595761089	2.3699777217282567	2.403589583096796	
and I have seen a lot of films. I saw this in the theatre in 1989 and to this day I remember the sickening urge to walk out. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the sanctity of the cinema-- this film has nothing to offer you. It is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward. As we see the progression of Belushi's life pass on the screen, Woodward actually shows up in the film like a ghost character. The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying, looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he weakly utters "Breathe for me, Woodward." There are too many terrible things to mention them all, the least of which is the opening that has Belushi jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named "Angel." I'll leave it at that.	-3.6894041066304215	-2.023676713734308	-1.614375372376091	-1.5519941476502843	-1.4007688330685926	-1.3778944913824795	-1.0309508357271604	-0.3952929924966725	-0.3195559756968562	-0.16800510264407606	-0.10458333843485407	-0.005857275217494851	-0.002317848662262794	0.10543589326569144	0.1887709409634842	0.24148542258351346	0.3054780736247913	0.49483532347179626	0.5548498947436904	0.6573779284215812	0.6615177740129404	0.9078884360546559	1.4961178118585428	2.07335346291079	4.195588832253956	
Directed by Govind Nihalani, this is definite cop film of Indian cinema. May be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force & politics with no holds barred & how it effects on a young cop. A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father. Agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop/bad cop Hindi films but this is different. Today's generation, which grown up watching dark & realistic films like- 'Satya', 'Company' may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making. The film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn't pay much attention to such kind of cinema & yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class & mass audience when it released. For Om Puri its first breakthrough in mainstream Hindi cinema & he delivered a class performance as Inspector Velankar. Its more than cop character, he internalized a lot which is something original in acting. Watch his scenes with his father whom he hates & Smita whom he loves. Smita Patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level. My God what a natural expressions she carried!!! Shafi Inamdar was truly a discovery for me & he's a brilliant character actor if given a chance & here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om. The movie is also a debut of a promising villain on Indian screen- Sadashiv Amrapurkar as 'Rama Shetty'. It's another story that he didn't get such a meaty role & almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of Dharmendra's B grade action films. Watch the scene where Om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father (played by Amrish Puri) & next both are sharing wine together. How inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love & hate for each other. Two faces of Indian Police Force- Masculinity & Impotency and in between lies- half truth (ardh satya)Kudos to Nihalani's touch. The film won 2 National Awards as Best Hindi Feature Film & Best Actor- Om Puri & 3 Filmfare Awards in Best Film, Best Director & Best Supporting Actor Categories. <br /><br />Recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious Hindi films.<br /><br />Ratings- 8/10	-4.06903125006502	-3.3137674626040745	-2.602548252342524	-2.454398588001294	-1.219073051176177	-0.9796341150879377	-0.8769914036762665	-0.629122343547752	-0.6260719819365148	-0.3762246100027069	-0.3661461941583411	-0.33815243321172284	-0.21904458698837193	-0.03531583022300079	0.09735150157027908	0.21161791144410189	0.6685733236595497	1.0853899688911333	1.1363373386587503	1.2896411718965461	1.4533075895912166	1.8258018444857267	2.7585703272464293	3.4125809480153144	5.7890291304589505	
You want a movie that'll take you places? Well this is a good pick. If you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film--the hayday of Motown--or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about, I suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. At the risk of sounding cliche, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll reminisce and remember. You'll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. You'll recall with fondness your best friends from school. It's a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism--misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone regardless of race, age, socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it. So take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film; there are much worse ways you could spend your time.	-2.433721893470116	-1.3710996008428769	-1.2839168308097744	-1.0266218590985057	-1.0092243031492423	-0.5793884013953439	-0.47764493005097375	-0.38790395839814545	-0.30647035857337585	-0.26397876407677673	-0.2625552901469145	-0.20836653492034232	0.047718761030902127	0.06640571726915546	0.0766962527605135	0.244938574066967	0.25364987814692547	0.4298143142426713	0.45499927922889	0.7031966297283494	0.7327265604679946	1.0257781042414025	1.6494192059968267	2.179611427628176	2.7041116476443126	
L'Appartement is, I think, a very purposeful Hitchcockian film. The plot was rife with symbolism (ie the white and red roses) and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly. The look was very Parisian and pulled you closer to the story. I saw it in London and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states	-0.9212881350031663	-0.9173401659775462	-0.82542568326549	-0.7828122980899047	-0.43358518459617856	-0.4202103891637137	-0.2753153720209523	-0.2748258496971632	-0.1181049321195318	-0.042849771608484716	-0.03367523190047719	0.021147740512482673	0.1155393278857299	0.12490605036346406	0.13523078737892213	0.15681583497180168	0.19906818116686942	0.20048124789144778	0.38048170491426275	0.5070703286027436	0.5145416110409446	0.536548449260754	1.1926953370443236	1.2957840584764246	1.6983339320010447	
Flight of Fury starts as General Tom Barnes (Angus MacInnes) organises an unofficial test flight of the X-77, a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible. General Barnes gives his top pilot Colonel Ratcher (Steve Toussaint) the job & everything goes well until the X-77 disappears, even more literally than Barnes wanted as Ratcher flies it to Northern Afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the Black Sunday lead by Peter Stone (Vincenzo Nicoli) who plans to use the X-77 to fly into US airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people. General Barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army John Sands (co-writer & executive producer Steven Seagal) to get it back & kill all the bad guy's in the process...<br /><br />This American, British & Romanian co-production was directed by Michael Keusch & was the third film in which he directed Seagal after the equally awful Shadow Man (2006) & Attack Force (2007), luckily someone decided the partnership wasn't working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration's between the two. Apparently Flight of Fury is an almost scene-for-scene word-for-word remake of Black Thunder (1988) starring Michael Dudikoff with many of the same character's even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although I must admit I have never seen Black Thunder & therefore cannot compare the two. Flight of Fury is a terrible film, the poorly made & written waste of time that Seagal specialises in these days. It's boring even though it's not that slow, the character's are poor, it's full of clichés, things happen at random, the plot is poor, the reasoning behind events are none existent & it's a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near Afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed. The action scenes are lame & there's no real excitement in it, the villains are boring as are the heroes & it's right down there with the worst Seagal has made.<br /><br />Flight of Fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn't even matched up that well, the background can change, peoples clothes change, the area changes, the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as it's all too obvious we are watching clips from other (better) films spliced in. Hell, Seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this. The action scenes consist of shoot-outs so badly edited it's hard to tell who is who & of course Seagal breaking peoples arms. The whole production feels very cheap & shoddy.<br /><br />The IMDb reckons this had a budget of about $12,000,000 which I think is total rubbish, I mean if so where did all the money go? Although set in Afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert Flight of Fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods, it was actually shot in Romania & the Romanian countryside does not make a convincing Afghanistan. The acting is terrible as one would expect & Seagal looks dubbed again.<br /><br />Flight of Fury is a terrible action film that is boring, amateurish & is an almost scene-for-scene remake of another film anyway. Another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from Seagal, why do I even bother any more?	-12.666185883204173	-8.223241758384527	-7.769003694370891	-6.986154181745489	-5.810484740637046	-2.414113273696088	-2.3625656974046656	-1.7281018750977923	-1.5798616956877838	-1.1479074231594382	-0.6940595673172614	-0.6162586899569816	-0.3894029346554909	-0.2095154493960124	-0.20181956999218065	0.3578778626959472	0.4262420089638369	0.6878859898994817	1.5924053980692474	1.5940585112467687	1.6841550362099638	2.8627795346996363	4.870515833036403	7.05871890912414	12.625890309735013	
This film had a great cast going for it: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres -- solid b-movie actors all. But this downer of a movie didn't use any of them to any sort of advantage, with none of their characters even meeting on screen (though Christopher Lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes).<br /><br />The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need. Then, out of nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society).<br /><br />Most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing. You almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end, just in vengeance for boring us to death.<br /><br />Unless you really like Chris Lee or seventies low-budget sci-fi, I'd give this one a miss. It falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.	-4.643407551669473	-2.1663390652116794	-1.9434666712228068	-1.8015537735395262	-1.6574582525551598	-1.6017314102484024	-1.5637346946283912	-0.4327142430389227	-0.1900042413613357	-0.16301219458724087	-0.15918006439736038	-0.04038962225447469	-0.035547063013491434	-0.022453274923547553	0.13779010634475275	0.29232893947936794	0.36688253872824395	0.5563265059082135	0.6229152501599542	0.6799524775449922	0.7154566110141042	0.8163018520052011	2.4257621417777995	2.5301147307699567	5.585662297823445	
I wouldn't call "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story" simply a kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a given actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.<br /><br />But I guess that I shouldn't focus only on the cast. I thought that this movie had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). True, it's escapism, but the perceptive kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in "Monsters Inc". Worth seeing.	-3.5406598036517107	-1.8939287456565492	-1.6351231000739275	-1.2909519538265974	-0.6665354296940442	-0.3988874966786121	-0.30686327664540175	-0.2574099766260586	-0.2326114705444835	-0.22399683634095807	-0.149420885998951	-0.09727353301014918	0.3498364764852203	0.4018731700101807	0.40830931450554664	0.6008949703144891	0.7577490289414802	0.7579905109215792	0.7853406601692747	0.8171899099614937	0.9875159884485946	1.236236891361822	2.086533687507003	2.6939223710251916	3.1259713648821976	
When i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. WRONG! There was NO suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs! When i was done watching this i had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through "the motions." i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it.	-1.0787726902940555	-0.8689131164500655	-0.8490572443886643	-0.7517110721219423	-0.3118799771651155	-0.2775099273748891	-0.26999535970873517	-0.05152742814759351	-0.04793041943970598	-0.04436949255924832	-0.029869223983867613	-0.005725329131379485	-0.003113600653275969	-0.0016930634220788353	0.05374898761188925	0.10209135369274354	0.15770026440380594	0.21940284511594293	0.39175396443013527	0.4372317596204052	0.45739333960581907	0.8398340380114507	0.8497890256732555	1.1257127368104818	2.0567424833170715	
A little girl's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed to be the body of a couple's missing daughter. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. All of this changes when one day, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter! With the help of an ex-cop and a reporter, she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess plot-wise, moves at an achingly slow pace, and is completely unscary. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the ending, but I'm not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film. Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 release--they aren't very accurate.	-2.221127637193664	-1.7154893664225805	-1.6867239147368227	-1.5602272683173268	-1.107016668473808	-0.7135988433614131	-0.6194351078526412	-0.4752300867669951	-0.3078018070331034	-0.24329327042953713	-0.2328102752239222	-0.05345089923296935	-0.027844809396937203	0.08682786414907472	0.09716783345451924	0.2739583401041037	0.33674083510034614	0.33906623062311175	0.3393443338436374	0.5977244683600982	0.7508845903916881	1.1592217909318412	1.4922040651000947	1.9738139732535458	3.3172947036000022	
There is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around , that 20 years later , it wont hold the same magic as it did before. I must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old .This film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess. It is engrossing , it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that. John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden's rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now. I urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10.	-1.669407132337203	-1.447059714046041	-1.2062966218943727	-1.069134802358319	-0.9324737968420895	-0.3245413833189785	-0.1806170180202585	-0.17670833912761869	-0.14129203184425373	-0.09689911664019735	-0.023734401767901897	-0.01872857988228792	0.004400356844928954	0.028790588539513662	0.1416029527972617	0.24668168745011898	0.269076974640415	0.36193785151146024	0.4219938776700698	0.5415337187048732	0.7362102547913087	0.9939836596568297	1.5991035313311732	1.797009886950098	2.3098158444754793	
The film 'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror films, but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film I have ever seen. Many horror films i've seen i've enjoyed watching, however, as they are based on horror, I know that the stories are unreal, as they are fictional, therefore I can't take them all seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror Genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films.<br /><br />This films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming Nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline. Most horror films i've seen are all quite fake, but because Nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and geniously directed with superb acting, especially by Craig sheffer (Aaron Boone) amazing special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogue, I found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody, whatsoever, that many other horror films have. Nightbreed, as well as being horror has elements of thriller, romance and action all rapped in one. If you haven't seen this film, I recommend you watch it, as I rate it a 10/10.	-2.1699889473483998	-1.5434286151775138	-1.3288371505319114	-1.1937703838828029	-0.7225296133863249	-0.5775715392676019	-0.4210128765973224	-0.23952318322189786	-0.19814526370680355	-0.17142322302967508	-0.16870980260869867	0.06067044696915551	0.2574506861500875	0.2917971382018446	0.296802699422187	0.4581088612764551	0.47660176574386615	0.6108770913208614	0.6274404409434985	0.8006776253998236	0.8329778528138884	1.3556489752825371	1.8640803336723732	2.0529187320337554	2.638771372793566	
Natalie Wood portrays Courtney Patterson, a polio disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair, with her partner being attorney Marcus Simon, played tepidly by Wood's real-life husband, Robert Wagner. The film is cut heavily, but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits Wagner to consistently somnambulate, laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from Wood, who also proffers a fine soprano. The script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout, as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at Wood, which must be discouraging to an actress. The progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this, coupled with choppy editing, leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring, motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing. Although largely undistinguished, the cinematography shines during one brief scene when Wood is placed in a patio and, following the sound of a closing door, remains at the center while the camera's eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty. More controlled direction would have allowed the performers, even the limp Wagner, to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship; as it was released, there is, for the most part, an immense lack of commitment.	-3.5424586171381307	-2.372415459459313	-2.202288298623288	-2.1885936848755296	-1.9061763966399936	-1.0508192505348228	-0.9017624117573919	-0.7647228828689503	-0.7634782145436427	-0.6227751566114215	-0.5060859853578303	-0.45604757637916105	-0.4275508492206481	-0.3613724284011839	-0.1856488123095132	0.10591222563293101	0.5153581053749563	0.6326192451152952	0.8865434759853463	0.890820473374824	1.0103782615825276	1.0870001209365738	1.1801526270361342	2.496502177832974	4.149811700253388	
Okay, you have:<br /><br />Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She's killed off in the first scene - that's right, folks; this show has no backbone!<br /><br />Peter O'Toole as Ol' Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor.<br /><br />Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. It's alright, they have Col. Cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for Christmas!) Still, she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!)<br /><br />David McCallum as said toy-boy, equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus.<br /><br />and finally:<br /><br />Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls' Boarding-School, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: "I've only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world." Well, we can't say they didn't warn us.<br /><br />Ah, Susan - time was, your character would have been running the whole show. They don't write 'em like that any more. Our loss, not yours.<br /><br />So - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of "Brideshead Revisited," right?<br /><br />Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!)<br /><br />First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - "hey, it's just the sunlight!"<br /><br />Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying, her eyes are moist. That's the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is "dewy-eyed."<br /><br />Henceforth, Leading Lady shall be known as L.L.<br /><br />Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. Still, I'll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?)<br /><br />And lastly, fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is "Mrs." She's either "Miss" or "Lady."<br /><br />When all was said and done, I still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done.<br /><br />To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all.<br /><br />OK, at the end, L.L. finds she's lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (there's always a "meanwhile,") some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when, I don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHE's going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be "whisked away" SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!)<br /><br />Great drama.	-12.935944508904248	-6.926915261981961	-4.546134428205738	-3.6394449162142206	-3.048908512939174	-2.9909953760233914	-2.7537938881205024	-2.244353936236439	-1.6695964974169986	-1.2683267886492584	-0.8425865848305679	-0.7005791694848829	0.15782183543610867	0.263893726617172	0.6309142924943317	0.6443018497811077	1.726957710587385	2.08648853098596	2.129658968354669	2.6226624034625674	2.6228509848610013	2.6869315766026	2.7542805809609145	6.266874144142569	13.452468069679528	
Ever since I can remember and I'm only 18 my mother and I have been and continue to watch older movies because well I find them much more rewarding in the long run (but hey don't get me wrong I do love the movies we have today just not as much as I love movies of the 40s and 50s) Anyways, now I have to say the moment I started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course my favorite character was the Grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family was portrayed. The children...did not act like children in the slightest. But there is good reason for that, having had to hid and run most of your life, seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence. So people saying "oooo i hated how the kids acted...blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see.<br /><br />Paul Lukas...dear Paul did an amazing job!!! Now I know many people are mad that he go the Oscar and Bogie didn't but hey they both did amazing jobs so I think it could have gone either way. But Lukas' performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears. I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone!! :-D	-3.146033966639314	-2.366802506682471	-2.0552842268471787	-1.507139919986615	-0.7203450009270703	-0.6001295333556974	-0.5493437376988664	-0.5179232609357937	-0.37100440297801174	-0.23225920614110304	-0.11596676669878438	-0.00468023592014806	0.01668224138760646	0.11033033463118819	0.3358831070500351	0.3592110098329793	0.3949267349497906	0.7249154838562918	1.0686915494148463	1.1297670330135945	1.215214281894356	1.2256477349017347	2.8278568421443024	3.4412745302622954	3.4760897010863654	
Don't listen to what the critics have always said about this cute, charming little movie. Madonna is GREAT in this clever comedy. I worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers- no one EVER brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it. Everyone always enjoyed it. It's actually a great movie for kids, too.	-2.2480455179444534	-1.569997026238195	-0.9315873057647238	-0.9209873493947369	-0.6970234335996782	-0.30636101568564544	-0.10919394262881431	-0.013353256080775353	0.037441902535870014	0.05934309408072635	0.06093423515881449	0.10836309979970343	0.2539534197287576	0.3038686153738601	0.30943790700523216	0.3822903123304495	0.4090513717576071	0.6093191402973747	0.7723493655311893	0.8357077030511674	0.9764547480894666	1.200013846985969	1.3941394554789048	1.57542198507841	1.9818335434178083	
OK, let's get this clear. I'm really not into sci-fi, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /><br />Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. It might sound like your usual sci-fi-series, but it's not! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series. I find that great. It gives you things, happenings and such you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets. They have some of course but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there's not many. <br /><br />The series has a nice blending of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here. They don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects.	-2.605875243582495	-1.5569557843184538	-1.5120993216092342	-1.141977953688537	-0.7830475049448112	-0.6822586840803145	-0.4071037992797	-0.10378897711410653	0.01943838535875929	0.028318586341077225	0.1818069663855313	0.18976098870380131	0.24148180084764498	0.2898418009182937	0.30991699247459853	0.3898423841560287	0.5257616551206401	0.5293351141801464	0.5792775359095016	0.8380816443762524	0.853544449510123	1.753165781045409	1.9722934249208366	2.857884624597148	3.806239657077571	
Stargate SG-1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate. In the Stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goa'uld such as Ra and Apophis. For millennia, the Goa'uld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs, Mayans, Britons, the Norse, Mongols, Greeks, and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy. Many well-known mythical locations such as Avalon, Camelot, and Atlantis are found, or have at one time existed.<br /><br />Presently, the Earth stargate (found at a dig site near Giza in 1928) is housed in a top-secret U.S. military base known as the SGC (Stargate Command) underneath Cheyenne Mountain. Col. Jack O'Neill (Anderson), Dr. Daniel Jackson (Shanks), Capt. Samantha Carter (Tapping) and Teal'c (Judge) compose the original SG-1 team (a few characters join and/or leave the team in later seasons). Along with 24 other SG teams, they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the Goa'uld, in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races.<br /><br />The parasitic Goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goa'uld are the primary antagonists. They are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. The original arch-enemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis (Peter Williams). Other System Lords, such as Baal and Anubis, play pivotal roles in the later seasons. In the ninth season a new villain emerges, the Ori. The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. The introduction of the Ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology into an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the Ori, their followers, and their enemiesthe Ancients.	-7.957378942396168	-3.655459642458018	-3.3584366340099185	-3.116402231003005	-3.0094712171640254	-1.6929057020937497	-1.5460678969115305	-0.8930444033087653	-0.7876492849783	-0.6612495220859584	-0.4879796026705405	-0.09628077482588385	0.11683345756642599	0.38421505037477705	0.5987759151319333	0.7106803387552267	0.8750763721047946	1.0510089266460563	1.0748452392807848	1.2024854383850547	1.4372881180235204	2.09021674819139	2.4250069710117668	4.210126029913203	7.982577590303664	
From reading all of the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but I didn't think it was THAT bad. I've seen much worse, actually.<br /><br />"The House Where Evil Dwells" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who move into an old house in Japan. Little do they know, a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.<br /><br />I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was corny, but I've seen worse in my day. The ghost sequences were a little over-done, we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. I may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of that film ripped this off a little. The old Japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc. But I may be wrong.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot. 4/10.	-8.212777451019479	-3.565055117034303	-3.484545068322084	-3.318769007292829	-3.2571820985126316	-2.648767099508196	-1.8684846009325027	-1.1031385787429324	-0.8718769426731932	-0.589470545664657	-0.5783203994990628	-0.3877645189916232	-0.3242563853574527	0.024531095729443113	0.34103069104747497	0.5494911309924426	0.7416226755323718	0.8649908177870278	0.9274695432630364	1.07946685156149	1.1191670891786236	1.526593703404693	3.098033742094803	4.134798310783479	8.588454894069525	
The girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. What I'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. The delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. Lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. And if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: They are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana mansion. That's the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths. Then, two of THEM disappear, and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt. Eureka! I just realized what one of those aforementioned "special circumstances" would be - unconsciousness.	-2.6478140759449245	-1.3857781934285742	-1.298686713244023	-0.9575162356851603	-0.7460160360954929	-0.6954194126601607	-0.5101333504606673	-0.32333535059148455	-0.30954158468294124	-0.08156129874097436	-0.043686020743884516	0.028449295474175407	0.04793855212477899	0.12657759448910239	0.2514576940953199	0.29613893249257733	0.34302841589599997	0.38958119439844613	0.4021593020531835	0.4826078716825139	0.6538266322089217	0.7613870642181391	0.9696426358787028	1.092229145087939	3.0130185311890014

Some people may call "Cooley High" the same sort of thing as "American Graffiti", but I wouldn't. For starters, in "AG", everyone was white, whereas in "CH" they're all black. Moreover, this one has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class African-American students in 1964 Chicago and their antics. The movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there's never any dad around. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.<br /><br />One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack. It is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). A classic in the real sense of the word.	-3.152328537041218	-1.9763328381431327	-1.4993583215324364	-1.1598501814845064	-0.493798722234599	-0.458575636839481	-0.44361996293284944	-0.4381125989629274	-0.4342356320279346	-0.29511727827405654	-0.21809782244860387	-0.20013247811922952	0.34737086675528217	0.3978371307900698	0.4438295478513724	0.46723445241966155	0.46913559750926015	0.5091384415971306	0.6510739901766442	0.8064290076592955	0.8666316723244352	1.4635552325215029	1.6939028099243307	2.4048247620368293	2.695044601251304	
Timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen. It wasn't all bad, I just think the reporters role was wrong for him.<br /><br />LL Cool J played the typical rapper role, toughest,baddest guy around. I don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie, not even when proposed to his girlfriend.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman pretty much carried the whole movie. He was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey wasn't good or bad he was just "there".<br /><br />Overall it's a Dull movie. bad plot. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors.	-4.1186341951226835	-2.421495060949469	-2.364630020762145	-1.9584432473702686	-1.9044308079351158	-1.1720665924799938	-0.9733535205032855	-0.8336854767406673	-0.554097087512112	-0.35250859172880405	-0.34058832275121853	-0.33757443995144837	-0.029689091399275752	0.031567972501766406	0.35982367213935296	0.4036715599625975	0.5177678817822704	0.5192391129449648	0.5758960435800335	0.8012614595050809	0.8129966650522387	1.176457132684909	1.2033612533241695	2.7984569836958424	4.975543130707404	
A genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a HUGE hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth. I am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish: HIGH ANXIETY, THE CHEAP DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DON'T LOOK NOW WE'RE BEING SHOT AT.......... and have no profile at all today. NORMAN was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again. Famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film, an experiment at the time, NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that The Farrelly Brothers should look at remaking today. If they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either. It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong. Just as it should be. In fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today.	-2.2958297712884614	-1.6073700260723724	-1.3697689892494307	-1.3291333666052558	-1.129212861145012	-0.9105974021611546	-0.8761803876264053	-0.43040240916399075	-0.31818785752459244	-0.04411739408998534	0.03831110539818911	0.05160986320564156	0.05168540281228581	0.10037746134558928	0.19208958611702578	0.22032020443747288	0.3204224443702397	0.3842824554964298	0.3904739560686377	0.515792651000217	0.5249701185796137	0.6316755317082238	1.0986762204583478	1.5232588860267886	3.3516922500101067	
WOW, finally Jim Carrey has returned from the died. This movie had me laughing and crying. It also sends a message that we should all know and learn from.

Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD-label, specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies  mostly Italian ones - from the glorious eras when everything was possible, namely from the late 60's up until the mid-80's. The label's selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they probably even borrowed the name of the latter) and they already released some really rare sick Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer", "Killer Nun", "Phantom of Death" and "Torso". "The Frightened Woman" was completely unknown to me, but since fellow reviewers from around here, whose opinions I hugely value, described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro-sexploitation movies of its era, I didn't hesitate to pick it up. This is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average cinema-loving audiences. If you're part of that remaining 1%, however, you're in for a really unique treat. The style, atmosphere and content are similar to Jess Franco's "Succubus" and Massimo Dallamano's "Venus in Furs", yet they're both widely considered as classics whereas "The Frightened Woman" is virtually unknown. It's all a matter of profiling and good marketing, I guess. The story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor (he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion, owns multiple old-timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life-size mannequin doll replica of himself) with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women. He considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping, humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street. Dr. Sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist Maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit, but he slowly falls for her. Just he starts to believe in actual love, she strikes back with a vengeance. This really isn't for everyone, but if you can appreciate moody & sinisterly sexy ambiances, bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal, you can consider this one a top recommendation. It's slow, stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers Shameless Entertainment, all right!	-6.208530849402975	-3.049566211083011	-2.920809203398004	-2.775257427600669	-2.6038580374644673	-2.2465902101825668	-1.3002383985177273	-0.7832616028034117	-0.6602052855424094	-0.33324406442419013	-0.054402848076855255	0.04747272604766492	0.17087907199602556	0.36500499558855404	0.432675514552225	0.5780592776729474	0.624833155574137	0.6475135941000374	0.8116362619681777	1.0854097590700205	1.1110740761447264	1.41728856490316	1.896758582538248	3.83893178240615	7.54570330820475	
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. I realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. Beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart rack...You know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget. I thought that I'd like to see Sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress-but YIKES is too kind a word to use...	-2.677697705991317	-1.3754135511879906	-1.367836558174851	-1.0671996758024276	-0.9971420453252459	-0.9385152846996447	-0.8321530856126185	-0.26721290691554317	-0.24590240782315526	-0.21451735606462163	-0.11280790364730481	-0.02868972325780417	-0.010415372897848676	-0.00487353641231715	0.050670718501465595	0.14646232504007864	0.22959007353565367	0.23649601812390808	0.30954985986442374	0.31384672345930026	0.3882641487457663	0.3981645551437338	0.9878535032107904	1.6408696846567292	2.971229664935936	
I went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b-rated movie. I came out surprised and very amused. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had amazing comedic timing. The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between. The plot was enough to tie it all together, a woman (Eva) dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was-to-be husband, its sounds far-fetched but it actually works quite well. <br /><br />7/10 - Overall its a worthwhile cinema watch, if not get it on DVD when it comes out.	-2.341684323971556	-1.907538611644664	-1.115887052354573	-1.055792033718409	-0.8693541203767212	-0.30624029046688217	-0.1377492121768342	-0.09598268707057196	-0.09227287269021042	-0.06628441480829911	0.34344683846621876	0.43471923534721557	0.4399490436998403	0.5275051198405528	0.6421437887887094	0.7059441894998608	0.7123792635578334	0.7715501203021766	0.7865322185104262	0.8359045998836109	0.9083042361587523	1.0830926768939186	1.7313578710033737	1.8822366592402648	2.4476392507185083	
Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way).<br /><br />Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clichés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early 20th century.<br /><br />For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: <br /><br />1) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character.<br /><br />2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where he seems downright stupid.<br /><br />3) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.<br /><br />4) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.<br /><br />5) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored.<br /><br />And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I didn't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this.<br /><br />And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way.<br /><br />All in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk.	-8.140616984860756	-4.120149355372479	-3.8146371662530294	-3.768822572006469	-3.7495059510371074	-1.8472070980761657	-1.212321467288554	-1.012567375942622	-0.8955288283853191	-0.7799921685387415	-0.7284242127834575	-0.7085987965317853	-0.3295289111423021	0.12173155901058294	0.16844595892645503	0.3573079537189689	0.458075061614419	1.110163489257892	1.2813369935531325	1.4258915620322412	1.5197037250896182	1.7127808320012186	2.078520943392613	4.582968265339953	8.51242200493083	
Amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I have long despaired of ever finding. Instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The lead characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you could know is easy. The movie is not trying to pull laughs, or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. <br /><br />I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thought provoking, funny look at love that I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Will soften even the hardiest heart.	-1.5036279173505918	-1.484337418651524	-1.01552496265893	-0.9736985710980626	-0.49157932332893506	-0.41624521328276454	-0.31349095866429955	-0.12842477728348967	-0.0977732948050687	-0.05689058339753836	-0.05070439231992377	-2.7811021267070204E-4	0.001776797422430157	0.16829767715975644	0.2760442231545078	0.2870942112331622	0.3675954264811274	0.40952142003952463	0.7120879021496459	0.7485963322783828	1.1408939670727052	1.1522590877668069	1.472836931245078	1.8694535767269234	2.135522260990289	
This movie has to be my favorite of all time. Its not supposed to have a plot, because its makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think)to believe it was a real snuff film. This was an exercise in visual effects, and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does. Movies these days are now all about sound effects, leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with CGI blood. There still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing. There is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film. Have you seen the hills have eyes 2? The rape scene was funny instead of shocking. Although i'm sure there are some GONZO porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror. But since they probably suck at making films, they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off. The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks.<br /><br />Its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability/talent to make his Hostel film series much much better, but he has too tame it down to get an R rating...or at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations.<br /><br />Watch Traces of Death or More than Smashed Pumpkins if you want no frills real footage (accident & crime scenes/footage). Don't forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film. That would be like someone saying the 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.	-8.559098782521925	-3.6882168955772325	-3.233235627720598	-3.149139853747391	-3.0307170379927464	-3.011741632352384	-2.6842234721026075	-0.8066878698135062	-0.7743281499164624	-0.33203948044625436	-0.24225165894231407	0.031276893615999196	0.25460442421577817	0.4402685957374963	0.4477978620796496	0.7599937148552315	0.8514794784626951	0.8523286713673879	0.959792521819606	1.03634137882882	1.299006902506781	1.4219304255128045	3.6057749735429856	4.689541254462628	9.318214979572707	
I would have liked to write about the story, but there wasn't any. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but "hinglish" is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill. I would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as... um mm, a Yash raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action, but I don't like cartoons much. <br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide - I promise it'll push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4. Movie Piraters: More power to them. If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers. Afterthought: The director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own. ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enough)<br /><br />Things that could have made this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Screenplay writer 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor=Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - "Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health" ?<br /><br />Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2. The English sub-titles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" becomes - "My heart is in a void" , "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" turns into "Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond" ..priceless.<br /><br />In short, Tashan to me, is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours! Woot!<br /><br />*sigh*..But thats just me. I could be wrong You've been warned anyways.	-13.079520036619082	-6.1152411396864625	-4.460366953215813	-4.411885797232344	-3.7785647752869367	-2.608770504940214	-2.1530075362973857	-1.9227973873301178	-1.8904943166793595	-1.8349045371815393	-1.5831259194994087	-1.4888769618590312	-1.2571094200604387	-1.0931227013721556	-0.3832136439641628	0.14100293533541183	0.23173180223061732	0.5768034363501734	1.23388057435044	1.5912931890296647	2.295891577078694	2.787262045424689	2.790829981024755	4.887725275618163	9.64087336412116	
This TV movie goes to show that bad films do exist. The only reason I saw this was it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. It's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing. With the many stars in this film, it made no difference. I really don't know why I watched this.	-3.179839651465971	-1.4275116495247389	-1.223702951467631	-1.0952986949652503	-1.0844680027772984	-1.0815270011106795	-1.0023640988138864	-0.6655027283322573	-0.28567443056819586	-0.235616611544871	-0.17306663266735958	-0.07240917333892766	-0.04959326463437699	0.04165397607425414	0.10795127673425298	0.1969178966908561	0.1988916511671578	0.3151072359946247	0.4002106696567192	0.42757479802302945	0.5608124678130452	0.6871826680358933	1.3344284824070776	1.3879224676087276	3.361477150290009	
Raising victor Vargas is just a bad film. No amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact.<br /><br />Maybe Peter Sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current "edgy film-making". Maybe he just doesn't know any better. It's hard to tell.<br /><br />What's not hard to tell is the result. Except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film-making into an attempt at pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it.<br /><br />I know I didn't.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and pass on this film.	-4.114688924681412	-1.5976293834913045	-1.5376869752621354	-1.2957265565467617	-1.1647641413801881	-1.0163152376630766	-0.9326912494366469	-0.4259825929484805	-0.41598748714273664	-0.30322373474438347	-0.17841238107746976	0.13039680194136266	0.19423045009343762	0.28483997143789125	0.28842893459294594	0.291948829337617	0.3713181339952711	0.3739597953734694	0.39722833643836963	0.4741495102413875	0.5280551010603995	1.0398268932473338	1.4219204840154906	1.7193957793892953	4.22209874735848	
This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who guilty is. The audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. The result is like every single episode of "Columbo" or "murder she wrote". The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock! This story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. Skip this one, you are not missing anything.	-2.973419846607764	-1.4501473014881028	-1.0701818070754028	-0.9672303593875875	-0.8928710300078805	-0.8452148956053326	-0.8162196003405436	-0.4113015207588975	-0.3730120183411608	-0.2397179827618761	-0.056967899130392935	0.044534957271025855	0.0721002394547604	0.1444560921091891	0.17090732521180138	0.219855492635562	0.3713850645612127	0.38099663833767955	0.38462448731730686	0.5037235578703684	0.6468460301706154	0.6931858676293773	1.1015174921671709	1.6998157541432868	3.3066565530822762	
This is a most handsome film. The color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant color. Other indoor scenes at various mansions, etc are equally brilliant. As for the music, what more can be said other than that Lanza's voice was at its' peak as he sang so many of the worlds' best known and beloved arias. The marvelous Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of Lanza in delightful harmony. Of course, Hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of Caruso. There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events. For example, the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth. There are some very good web sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him. These web sites can be located by using any good search engine. There are also several books available concerning his life history. But, the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film. The voices of Lanza, Kirsten, and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie. Enjoy, I know that I sure did.	-4.420050619219961	-3.495045683237639	-1.9934754081291033	-1.6755967675627004	-1.3082557982883534	-0.18623849470362303	0.0733023447572908	0.18536889359442352	0.20730165974984133	0.24831133945403594	0.25224206785672065	0.46517604903968135	0.6440898848187188	0.8036657669405554	0.8104026427013841	0.8566297839019805	1.0980079586636189	1.1773922664222165	1.2599331846123658	1.3727822468438697	1.5187453610360118	1.8754928839225937	2.6646876193195044	3.1831063484830677	5.058471917955499	
The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies, in my opinion, that are perfect. This little B picture is a taut story, well told. I've always been intrigued by Alexander Knox, but have seen him very few movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse. The performance is one of the most chilling performances I've ever seen. Since World War 2, actors who played Nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for Oscars. I imagine that since this was made during the war, the Academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil. But Knox puts in that kind of performance--a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer. I still can't get over it.<br /><br />Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly, is cast against type in probably the best performance I've ever seen her give, too. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career. Nothing against her; I have enjoyed her in those "slight" roles she often played. But here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.<br /><br />If you like human drama stories, or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this fine little film.	-4.461981761056001	-2.4486611095709896	-2.1402883402248376	-2.109718328773962	-1.4008125271562792	-0.906359751897892	-0.7630204729698727	-0.27234974020407937	-0.14511060902273568	0.05775957057141448	0.06986709468906227	0.4024432946099556	0.5040409054043257	0.5123711879173463	0.5924794268333224	0.8230177539048196	0.8413445422882279	0.8519991315216803	1.1492847372815718	1.4055298514120778	1.5029960761349896	1.6594542707307594	3.5738798899848985	4.647266580290516	6.514610418812086	
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen...<br /><br />It's so full of details and every time you see it you'll find new things... Like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice, and when the girls flute, they can't do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls, and there aren't. <br /><br />I have some problem finding out, about in the middle of the movie their "Uncle" visit them, but why does his wife freak out?!? Else a fantastic movie.!!! The best Asian movie ever.<br /><br />I hope people will enjoy it.

As if the storyline wasn't depressing enough, this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher. Weird stuff. Then there's the core premise of the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what sort of traumatic childhood did he have? Just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly. He tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did, but it's really really so hard to empathize. Such sad and unusual self destruction. Was it supposed to be funny? What was it all about really?	-4.322511153862669	-1.8343725254007426	-1.6616008380199339	-1.4913312786192001	-1.1048566007219465	-0.9200774963225433	-0.5738173616042485	-0.5120296778046397	-0.46326945964098243	-0.38878928886685926	-0.36122448916591726	-0.26308669566601883	-0.2462520678613357	0.010416773159090467	0.11571257923068244	0.20395144292766984	0.2462080455590996	0.3755120199813907	0.5261906011588798	0.7049864837534073	1.0348767436974444	1.0931965907730818	1.475344019016335	2.5843988662253174	4.445896910825848	
Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hitch hiker one evening. Two years later, having discovered the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent home, only to find that the man's been hanged for murder. Nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime.<br /><br />Sutherland is the man's alibi but he's turned up too late. Out of a sense of guilt, he tracks down the real murderer.<br /><br />Agatha Christie's mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people, all of them with one or another motive for the crime, all of them suspect, and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict time line. There is often, not always, a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk things over.<br /><br />Because of the anfractuosity of the situation, due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer. Redundancy is perfectly okay. We have to keep the characters and the time lines straight. Christie's movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh, yes, that's Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan-Globus production, with all that implies in the way of production values, a thoughtfully prepared script, and skill behind the camera.<br /><br />The first few minutes, in which Sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged, are fine. After that, everything is flung at the viewer in disjointed scraps, often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing. The script has a slapdash quality, as if thrown together by two hacks overnight. Few of the faces are familiar and that doesn't help at all. Everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble. The musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is thrown in to wake up the dozers in the audience. If Dame Agatha were alive, she'd be among the viewers who needed to be shaken awake.<br /><br />Dullsville.	-6.854192393104333	-4.069352589965708	-2.8642149361447165	-2.120071717441587	-1.7189319860340355	-1.6487614549429117	-1.6270483363642758	-1.5641395857650218	-1.3401590903821725	-0.8882740654480767	-0.2694100286760485	-0.08243369288822908	0.06536793000829413	0.40928665143201776	0.5609856188111301	0.6605145630433613	0.8537284316048963	0.9647620482181107	1.3139338911388747	1.7305878172096547	2.0372110095021996	2.465620825046447	2.6644667671724247	4.3983884048103485	8.647649217691713	
I just saw this film again, I believe for the sixth time. I will doubtless see it many more times. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director, Gilles Mimouni. For ten years he has not made another film, and this was his only one. The story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect, and it is clearly paying homage continually to both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. The split-second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on Keaton in 'Steamboat Bill Junior', and he is only not killed by inches. In this film, people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares, and if they had been one second off, they would have collided. The storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond, or you will miss something crucial. The haunting, albeit intentionally repetitive, music by Peter Chase is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and the whole film has the same eerie quality, but whereas Hitchcock had one woman be two women, Mimouni has two women be one woman, thereby inverting the plot structure. There are passing references to other Hitchcock films, but it is 'Vertigo' which is central to the inspiration of this film. The theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love, but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events, the invisible threads behind the tapestry, the ineffable. Everything is hyper-charged with passionate love and desire, but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object. That is why it is so easily transferable from Lisa to Alice, when it is realised that it is Alice who is more mysterious than Lisa, and it is Alice who truly embodies the Eternal Mystery. The film is ultimately 'made' by Romane Bohringer. She is so fascinating that she outshines Monica Bellucci, which is really something to pull off, considering that Bellucci is a knockout beauty, whereas Bohringer is what the English call 'plain'. However, Romane Bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the art of 'personality dominance', whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don't get noticed because Romane is being so fascinating you can't take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls, and you end up only thinking of her. Most of us remember, I'm sure, her father Richard Bohringer lying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film 'Diva' many years ago. I would rather watch Romane than Richard lying in a bathtub, but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating, because Richard Bohringer is spellbinding too, and he isn't even a woman. Romane looks as if she may turn into Anna Magnani when she is much older, and that means she will get an Oscar, if someone can only write another 'Rose Tattoo' for her. The girl has so much passion inside her, she could set the Seine on fire. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she and Julie Delpy teamed up? This film made wonderful use of Paris locations. But where is this 'square in the Luxembourg'? It looked like Place Furstenburg to me. Maybe I missed something. I must watch the film another six times, just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom, and make sure I've got it right. The whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster. How thrilling it all is! Romane, you can look through my window anytime! Mimouni, come on over, let's discuss impossibilities, unlikelihoods, coincidence, synchronicity, everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible. And once again, we have here the spirit of Breton's novel 'Nadja' embodied in a great French work of art. More! More! More!	-6.833343157367254	-6.043919593550385	-5.155451649586443	-4.4212654215719285	-3.2401091638844055	-2.519310266002296	-1.9278086428429813	-0.9768201715894725	-0.6128129826323964	-0.2593894739649378	-0.14283628312647106	-0.09937835174909576	-0.048490554798100605	-0.02256557987467353	0.34993309889514934	0.4123626026621388	0.7322524626111027	1.0958289377784192	2.8414903971245318	2.846174840344028	2.856335674061697	4.453212201229402	6.492124102706417	7.504042367331965	11.35344577599704	
Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey's best pictures since... well... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time too... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene in, it is where Jim is messing up the anchor man's voice.<br /><br />My rating: 8/10	-1.779458740234433	-1.0737273564043965	-0.5941675097228041	-0.4323857009626084	-0.2740910906361987	-0.1438618953885578	-0.13170618532180672	-0.07523963847675702	0.012467395371592463	0.05906716161498381	0.06344461608824586	0.09237039732644009	0.32413727333101217	0.32669418777950826	0.36185590049176786	0.40366666913193033	0.42923849556063154	0.45851512387208	0.7827447208529099	0.8953364731811896	0.9599559216169111	0.9994934340670613	1.0504479641977398	1.448922875127393	1.8633228726630833	
This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, "Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are!" I'm from the area and I experienced the film as "Just the way people in California think we are!" I've lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there. We laughed a lot, we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age; the young people went out together at night. The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else.<br /><br />Aside from the "if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed" condescension, the story lacked any elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of dread.<br /><br />Martha's character was the worst drawn. It's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she probably would have made friends there. I've read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, prettier and thinner" but if this is the case it isn't shown. All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt.<br /><br />Just one more thing: Are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks? Please. This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level.	-4.095236825409716	-3.101531913625889	-2.6164019160432215	-2.4676429300044	-1.6781116931161544	-1.2274064495689538	-1.0465297194249743	-0.5544684502636155	-0.08812956610731593	0.03946645009628356	0.043458571513752334	0.08865421762104468	0.23369317801435574	0.27280903613923047	0.3355853503290843	0.3644110254956605	0.4776625801490808	0.621144905662752	0.9936986321183772	1.0094397976432286	1.2998080855629166	1.3416203426897593	2.1240183750468375	3.79559493427166	6.424510321368805	
Not even the Beatles could write songs everyone liked, and although Walter Hill is no mop-top he's second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies. The nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film, the emergence of the Rapper turned movie star was in full swing, the acting took a back seat to each man's overpowering regional accent and transparent acting. This was one of the many ice-t movies i saw as a kid and loved, only to watch them later and cringe. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications. I hand it to Walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location. But i fault everyone involved for turning out Lame-o performances. Ice-t and cube must have been red hot at this time, and while I've enjoyed both their careers as rappers, in my opinion they fell flat in this movie. It's about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief. Now this is a movie, its not a documentary so i wont waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie, but there were many, and they led nowhere. I got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was sord of confused and just playing things off the cuff. There are two things i still enjoy about it, one involves a scene with a needle and the other is Sadler's huge 45 pistol. Bottom line this movie is like domino's pizza. Yeah ill eat it if I'm hungry and i don't feel like cooking, But I'm well aware it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.	-5.717221944264649	-2.9991077236057206	-2.5864509866455707	-2.1997217562007094	-2.053629732355043	-1.5028320511156008	-1.4674577570920462	-0.7092176260666969	-0.5513040672814361	-0.5141720151099316	-0.3861517443908845	-0.1329296094836216	-0.07294902906899392	-0.010666277025927567	0.1449453896565247	0.337314817102799	0.33815541350939105	0.7778865529087982	1.161065470426277	1.172656936375179	1.1827409390832784	1.347253891019409	1.3669860183148386	3.403506116175009	6.512008950773682	
I hate to sound like an 'old person', but frankly I haven't seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960... generally, movies just seem to get worse and worse (although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle "The Bread, My Sweet", except for the 'de rigeur' sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie). This movie makes the mother, a former Las Vegas chorus girl, seem to be incapable of surviving on her own, although she is clearly in her 50s (though hinted at being in her 40s). I didn't buy it. I'm 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s, more than capable of surviving on my own (as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13, got legally emancipated and set off on my own life's journey.) <br /><br />The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve (a great opportunity) and drops that ball too, but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her down as an 'opportunist', when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide-open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her coworker, a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of honoring her promises (to her boss, in this case).<br /><br />The daughter grudgingly 'allows' her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother (the woman who gave her Life and raised her to 'adulthood') like a pariah. Apparently the 'writers' of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT 'the common thing' for PARENTS to act like children, and then be treated AS children by THEIR children. That is just more of the societal 'baloney' that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we, their public, were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings.<br /><br />This is a sad movie with a stupid ending. If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two-dimensional 'tv character', he'd have stayed with the MOTHER, who was not that much older than him and quite attractive. But in the end he 'falls' for the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way. (The 'opportunist' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.)<br /><br />There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter (who was an uptight, selfish, self-centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect) to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted, sweet-tempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend. Of course the mother had her own flaws... she had reacted to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.<br /><br />Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed, this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney.

A funny thing happened to me while watching "Mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating mannequins...er, excuse me, corpses) through his images. On the other hand, the English version at least is very badly dubbed. So I found myself wishing there had been both more AND less dialogue at the same time! This film is stupid (funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town) and lurid (where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!)...Miss it.

I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.<br /><br />On the discussion board, I found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. It says: "'Deed Poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. The brilliant acting of Barbara Kowa and André Schneider, the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work (Steffen Ritter) make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). However, the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains." Unfortunately, this is true. I wasn't intrigued by the story at all. The protagonists are cold, ambition-less people. They do a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. So what? For many times, the direction seemed to be virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing.<br /><br />What's the point of the movie? What's the message behind it all? The anonymous reviewer said: "Somehow Biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid-air without a message. Thus the boredom I blame on the movie. The movie is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral and it doesn't take long to see the flaws: for long stretches the characters of Sean and Ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with the English pronunciation), the character of the mute brother is not developed very well. Some moments are very promising though - in the scene where the call boy is skinned (the one and only true love scene) an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long. As a spectator one has to regret the chances given away." Again, I must agree. I did like the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom I had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. (The sex scenes, though, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.)<br /><br />All in all, "Deed Poll" was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea wasted -, but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money. Maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would have become a better movie.	-7.349580781015277	-4.34537538233404	-3.593949338693089	-3.136069678389397	-2.76718547678074	-2.6701949542434593	-2.0815245429255036	-0.9005921022050779	-0.8884072083045487	-0.613188936988305	-0.3609914625016438	-0.19546825732928885	-0.04682332042769381	-0.04542545479967347	0.09351738124801069	0.6001418333761516	0.8988716517388488	1.2620136982421608	1.4727206440741596	1.7072069866172999	1.7270695079552898	2.0804199696667185	2.9814092274674207	4.749397598976045	10.421790660979283	
One of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked. One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. While the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner. If these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.	-2.5694904138579004	-1.0924122391094373	-1.0904703163723042	-0.9689532386770522	-0.9389725606021114	-0.8587451926921317	-0.7660418956410805	-0.3203740139356519	-0.308158337432454	-0.27436831664097616	-0.19182761013513794	-0.08133940209930848	-0.011986239956637598	0.03561920036087905	0.10291796419310933	0.12656768721499628	0.20742354283421463	0.2385048194060144	0.24460205845354518	0.41795557629688623	0.498489675231044	0.5346974595856993	0.8248864951060033	1.235463857647379	2.563351406636351	
I actually flipped to Lifetime channel by mistake, just as this movie was beginning, and ended-up watching it. <br /><br />It certainly deals with a serious issue, probably more prevalent than we realize, in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego-maniacal fellow-student, who feels he's above the system, and, unfortunately, often is.<br /><br />The cast here was believable, and the performances credible. A lot of these Canadian/Lifetime flicks are decidedly "over-the-top." However, this is one I might label as "under-the-top."<br /><br />While appreciating the fact that it wasn't presented in an overblown fashion, this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper, the 96 minutes seemed like many more, and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film, looped over-and-over, seemingly going on and on and on and ON - before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion.<br /><br />Yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type, despite these criticisms.<br /><br />And while these pictures often "milk" the climax, this one could have given it a bit more detail and length.	-2.435887088517642	-1.949870968565643	-1.6788278474442568	-1.5728864628329433	-1.4718564246046137	-0.847315010296806	-0.7462610752220361	-0.4966940344006091	-0.49224334771155037	-0.33334335910232604	-0.29695261150353286	-0.27545149891320986	-0.24564372070234694	-0.2105011878672519	0.32037150436673195	0.3509292868688316	0.4021574015675025	0.4722343331437604	0.47795485688891115	0.9304620573849406	0.9318674799621924	1.2682908484735755	1.585474567665498	2.117561706800871	3.3109757834460387	
To most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. For others like Soo-mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon's brilliant Gothic horror story A Tale of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong), and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong), who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy Victorian-style mansion. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other for survival with the older Soo-mi obsessively protecting the younger Soo-yeon against danger. For Soo-mi, however, not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother's death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality.<br /><br />While we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings, doors that open and close on their own, a cruel and overbearing stepmother, and other events of high strangeness, A Tale of Two Sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. Soo-mi says "Do you know what's really scary? You want to forget something. Totally wipe it off your mind. But you never can. It can't go away, you see. And... and it follows you around like a ghost." There is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel. The plot cannot be summarized, only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective.<br /><br />In the film's opening, Soo-mi, an obviously disturbed young woman, is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened "that day", the film flashes back to when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to the home of their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who is really hurting. As the girls try to readjust, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences.<br /><br />Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions, a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from photographs, and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity. While we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone's mind, we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until an important clue is offered in the film's second half.<br /><br />Shot in gorgeous low-light cinematography, A Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares, and there are plenty. It is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to. While the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light, it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness. In the words of a wise observer, "Blame is never the answer - whether it is blaming yourself or others. Rather, the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely - both of yourself AND others. Forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing."	-7.9789014870749195	-4.558493092397753	-4.286230450071146	-3.268263131374455	-2.828886607825774	-2.0090898132517068	-1.8275130496925884	-1.824550186225511	-0.9260233891281987	-0.7665916946672682	-0.2319895734984142	0.5327596818297888	0.7671089699476898	0.8064009712511755	0.8920502585508872	0.9870350780894389	0.9948044120472771	1.3061453809591625	1.7551614516594924	1.9103825083133157	2.156476744222855	2.9639035269481275	3.2820338377397786	4.592162313973302	10.898852318223543	
Call it manipulative drivel if you will, but I fell for it. Sure, there could have been more character development. Yeah, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant "movie of the week" score, but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding adorable and touching, and let's face it people, in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others. Not many. We did get a little glimpse into the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialog in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so in my opinion, this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his "comfort zone" to reach out to another human being, and in the mean time, touched the lives hundreds more. A lesson we all need to me reminded of. Why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do? I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. You won't be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10	-3.3927712468474662	-1.592319496551789	-1.0187534453051899	-0.9888644246571627	-0.6801263222904412	-0.5652806453288545	-0.4877541852153625	-0.18092747482992014	-0.007361574655454796	0.07915879233085285	0.0907841425353625	0.1351373981675153	0.18014034763709508	0.3074699254550374	0.3697327801880535	0.42091535899943117	0.5669354214577047	0.5926473364615923	0.6245502506864871	0.8242140715740617	0.9418031332526119	0.9915805224123239	1.757931595447246	2.2175176880983045	2.958713998806362	
Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-nazi propaganda films made during World War Two. Paul Lukas was certainly deserving of his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was. I would recommend this film to those interested in that era, and, of course, the fabulous films of the late, great, Ms. Bette Davis.	-2.543334689597028	-1.3529033534901944	-0.9114389767193771	-0.6994900858811013	-0.6774281165308317	-0.3981783492574859	-0.04002922833696633	-0.02377120436301359	-0.01751822191925876	0.0868740420945945	0.17654919267346766	0.2727247160942282	0.3933507290075847	0.49874548808751296	0.535568450571171	0.6866322037494639	0.7339617318582029	0.7570455939623857	0.7597421580794446	0.8371177175005946	0.879803481220859	1.134871161029415	1.3081468006473602	1.6971835470913346	2.2802106436280436	
I hate this movie. It is a horrid movie. Sean Young's character is completely unsympathetic. Her performance is wooden at best. The storyline is completely predictable, and completely uninteresting. I would never recommend this film to anyone.

Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards, but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance.<br /><br />The genre's well-known weaknesses are in full gear: banal dialogue, wooden acting, illogical plot points. And the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say: limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though.

This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously. It is a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it is so enjoyable. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It is amazingly bad. And the ending, which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome. Predictable, but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat. Don't even give this film a chance and you will love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she does appear naked. Her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with, but she does get attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of large cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7.

I'm a fan of this generally excellent though sometimes rather dull show but Season 3 has taken some terrible plot directions. The episode HERO is an example of what I mean.<br /><br />The story as it eventually unravels is that the Cylons deliberately allow Bulldog - a pilot captured several years earlier during a black ops mission - to escape, steal a Cylon ship and get back to Galactica. The plan is that when Bulldog gets back he will figure out that Adama left him to his fate and be so enraged that he will kill Adama, which he very nearly does.<br /><br />Now the problem is this - the Cylons set it up so that Bulldog thinks he has escaped by himself. This means that Bulldog gets off the Cylon ship with no assistance. So he kills a Cylon and walks out of his holding cell - that much we see. Then, we must suppose that he walks to the flight hangar, manages to get into a Cylon fighter ship and learn how to operate it, takes off and flies back to Galactica. Just like that.<br /><br />Now Starbuck managed to get one of them working in Season One, which was barely believable in itself, but she only had to fly it visually out of orbit before making contact with Galactica. Bulldog has to programme his ship so that it makes several jumps through hyperspace and manages to catch up with Galactica somewhere thousands of light years away, in an unknown direction. How does he manage to programme a ship that contains completely alien technology? Cylons connect to their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And having managed that miraculous feat, how does he then know where Galactica is, bearing in mind that Galactica took off some 3 years before and is trying ever since to evade the Cylons - it does not leave beacons behind? Even allowing for the suspension of disbelief that must apply to any sci-fi show, this episode still absolutely no sense whatsoever.	-6.136935900005351	-2.5565184641602743	-2.3800508480437506	-2.19993698008657	-2.084799078954308	-2.0470132232685603	-1.3210271768286126	-0.8788712037953067	-0.3645360293947739	-0.35604170241586264	-0.2583099836888967	0.26819026231473836	0.27141313516548554	0.4099352946522158	0.4106385920418435	0.4203004611509295	0.4569554501232767	0.5238673122518451	0.5666081293947899	0.773770538896398	0.8389720982953692	1.118820861030407	2.782183606907582	2.885138859965427	6.606024947803468	
Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it. I haven't even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. O.k that's a little much but stealing is worse.<br /><br />Ever seen Pontypool? It was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008, this radio host goes into work, and then this zombie attack happens. We only see what's going on inside the radio station, and the only guess we have on what's happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky Ken Loney (easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind) and the BBC calling in for an update on the situation. From all the reviews I've read, and from the conversation I had with my friend (who has seen this film and Pontypool) this film was exactly like it in the story, with minor tweaks here and there. So throw originality and creativity out the window. As for the Zombies, or the infected, whatever you want to call them. They are the exact same thing, just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly, and have a never ending quench for flesh. They are Zombies. ZOMBIES!!<br /><br />ZOMBIES!!! Okay one to many, but back to this crappy movie. The Zombies from what I've heard are a lot like the ones in 28 Days Later, another better movie, with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh. This is where Zombie movies define themselves, story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as your not taking the idea of another film). Sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story, as is the case with Pontypool, but the zombies have to be, in a way, original. 28 Days Later started the insane raging Zombie. Pontypool I can't even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film. The Evil Dead, I think all i have to do is just type the name again because, come on it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the master, and he went through all different types of zombies, from the painted face zombies in Dawn of the Dead to raging zombies in Diary of the Dead, and he did each one with his own unique style.<br /><br />So, after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's about time I explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This movie down right steals the original story outline to Pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing, yet in Hollywood it's allowed, and apparently approved of. This is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie, and just tries to tell it differently. The 90's is like the worst period for movies ever, sure it had some gems but what decade doesn't, and it's because all the movies were the exact same. My favorite, the crime movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it till the very end. They force feed you one suspect, make it seem impossible that it's not anybody else but him, then, bam, all this time it was this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn't there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue, say "hey guys, what did i miss?" OH! DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING DID YA! Well, I'll leave a cliché as my closing statement. This is one film you'll surely want to miss.	-14.069864221653217	-6.929384269965817	-6.328188362947956	-6.02069772575183	-5.926691086722485	-3.478150955104534	-2.389752396861818	-1.4183317149031343	-1.3095483254089069	-1.1381074400009419	-0.8700656448928545	-0.33891901966915333	-0.0571808756699458	0.32614128494858374	0.4248297556192363	0.6004598568318249	0.6952788113355742	1.1758269824007452	2.0067245065102637	2.538531436725569	2.838794261030853	2.8814189779994672	4.0078014234537855	8.173997649739116	15.234053290778997	
I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.<br /><br />Not once were any of the scenes believable. The shots were badly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.<br /><br />2/10; the bonus is from the one time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it, too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly. This movie just stunk.	-6.165199488860138	-3.112266642376044	-2.804582136463162	-2.14889550590347	-2.057874456080195	-1.7040543903901546	-1.606466990986189	-0.45333972651305887	-0.4195570751989472	-0.40471562616841095	-0.35322828332144796	-0.2841001181494328	-0.21424860016092329	0.12981774810001878	0.38890721017177826	0.5690131642129078	0.7858845313788291	0.8214761337553019	0.9908851663311715	1.1188226401918582	1.139295707169649	1.2489379084673884	1.6156724985296975	3.826500868432381	6.573316557631092	
This film was hard to get a hold of, and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt. With all of this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a lackluster, talk-laden flick of this true-life event. While Williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that the D.B. Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off. Harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty, but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction. Shame on this film for even existing.	-3.171693176167878	-1.8585248522757638	-1.76923252002681	-1.651101269180144	-1.4802693040002606	-0.8952630587001562	-0.5485034762513177	-0.5355108452930706	-0.5226430745363587	-0.4914105258110582	-0.47742497004274626	-0.46778163524866945	-0.28849182221227676	-0.26564751826419586	-0.14329216636630615	-0.014304632918940269	0.11646857454285432	0.2862740266603862	0.3393475285570236	0.5551450964150022	0.7237494941958277	1.15573311395836	1.1642986238919033	2.0103022550332335	3.517880953226236	
I mistakenly thought this was the 70's art film about the bed that eats people, which sounded interesting. It isn't. Interesting, I mean, let alone about a man-eating bed.<br /><br />I assume Stuart Gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that Lloyd Kaufman puts "Troma" on just about anything that's been shot with a video camera, in the interest of building up a franchise library. Little more can be said about this opus other than the running time is less than 90 minutes. It is, of course, about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man, or something, that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way we get **a five minute opening credit sequence (is the one for "Lawrence Of Arabia" even as long?) **a murderer with Marylin Manson contacts who kills using the same technique as the troll in "Cat's Eye" **demonstrations of a sexual practice Michael Hutchence may have employed **a preview of what Emilio Estevez will soon look and act like **soft core porn even Cinemax would pass on **manbutt and one topless scene **a wacky (or is it "whack"-ee?) ending involving unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and leftover strawberry pie (well, it looked that way to me) **and a rudimentary surprise ending apros pos of nothing much. It's like the screenwriter even fell asleep on the "Deathbed" before finishing the last draft.<br /><br />It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's shot on hi-def video and doesn't look bad but doesn't look good either, the acting is just good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else. No one would probably have even seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie, the modern day "double feature." I wasn't paying attention for parts of it so I may have missed something. But for some reason I doubt it.

After working on 7 movies with director Mickael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. THE DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is their first and best film together. Raoul Walsh portrays the General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debuts at West Point, to the Civil War and finally at the battle of Little Big Horn. It's true the film shows a too heroic portrait of Custer, but that's not important. What is important, is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the touching Mrs Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the diabolic Sharp well played by Arthur Kennedy ?<br /><br />An eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso.	-1.7081525860297424	-1.154963740019184	-0.8814020847820099	-0.8142481661144703	-0.5397590149493965	-0.47771528362385984	-0.20494971346617782	-0.047360004447951104	0.0779669547829015	0.15216803889027625	0.1846953764428346	0.21484175411251322	0.23620523306354124	0.3523194639849547	0.3635176841030565	0.4751568604695876	0.5041709838069994	0.5134567221769095	0.5211281658729991	0.5385803895040425	0.5802136821693383	0.7494620331870346	1.2808321567666723	1.933927669836557	2.064597781559035	
Or "Marlowe At Sea". Yet another ridiculously overrated old film with Bogey. Quite talky, too. Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, calls women "slim" and "dames" and other such nonsense, is the only "real male" i.e. alpha male in the movie (the only other alpha male male being the head of Gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha male male), and - naturally - every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction. The character clichés are all here. Bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic-about-to-reform as in "Casablanca", and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him? It doesn't, so he can't be a cynic; Hawks wanted it both ways: a character who is both the "cool lone cynic" and yet a well-meaning humanitarian. I don't think so... Bacall does her non-chalant "cool babe" routine for the first time, and there are plenty of overrated, not all-too interesting so-called "sexual innuendo" exchanges between her and Bogey; these dialogues sound silly by today's standards. "Just purse your lips and whistle...". A load of crap... She was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older, and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland, the cuteness of a Myrna Loy, let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suited for playing vampires, not femme-fatales. (In real life she is very much like her face: a Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene in which Bacall breaks into tears; very unsuitable for her character. There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready.<br /><br />If you're interested in reading my "biographies" of Bogart, Bacall, Huston, and other Hollywood personalities, contact me by e-mail.	-7.114497825185169	-3.529418876228248	-3.1766080134189916	-2.6395536242231197	-2.536662213821601	-1.8893055188978243	-1.1312750311771558	-1.0601011753088692	-0.7356834202055776	-0.6625774540037332	-0.4793874282800292	-0.22948417217396805	-0.15983534979527284	-0.15713299460327615	0.16123712760898107	0.25719347788356667	0.6529982261187003	0.9368746180679026	0.9439705046951279	1.2062293743918555	1.2298603970645285	1.2979394525009564	1.9156074676188444	3.5117934399578297	7.558581015092923	
Before I really slag this film off, I just want to say I absolutely loved it. <br /><br />Firstly, how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase "You're Right."? I'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before I gave up and started watching the film again.<br /><br />Secondly, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? OK, so the Dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye, but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie-creatures?<br /><br />and finally, 'Old faithful here will protect me' hahaha :)	-2.693077222591136	-1.0562247033403032	-0.9675737634310806	-0.9035439439608344	-0.6204546659274158	-0.5972806895264758	-0.5773495527873035	-0.33625658804439	-0.2867414071251943	-0.21873430542211697	-0.21621713384882302	-0.11364974914692663	-0.03784243169381031	0.006158469222276912	0.03722486224504995	0.09631369213339139	0.15062949533985592	0.16595246786377768	0.20037493874580758	0.22084208393155189	0.26772653589070716	0.31350710722816105	0.85872156400421	0.9381471932431789	2.300052125678662	
For a movie like this, there's always something to follow by in years to come. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", makes a horror movie that is part-Goth, part-Mythology, and all horror in-between. "Nightbreed" are a bunch of mutants who only come out at night, and roam the place called Midian. Now a man name Boone(Craig Sheffer) claims to suffer hallucinations he goes to this shrink Dr. Decker(David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone with his problems. Unaware of this situation, Decker claims to be a purist which he's only a hate-monger in disguise. Boone however, goes into Midian and make the claim that he's one of the mutants there. But a mutant named Peloquin(Oliver Parker) sees Boone as meat! His bite however, spares Boone so after he is killed by a gauntlet of fire arms, he's one of them now. After being mislead by Decker, Boone does everything in his power to protect Lori(Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and in return helps the others as well. I liked the lady mutants one who gives a smoky "kiss of death" and the Porcupine Woman who dreamed Boone show off her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time. I've enjoyed this horror movie all the way, and the rule of it is, never trust a shrink! Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!	-2.8544380732723984	-2.233620765395513	-1.780894395004707	-1.0475584459315055	-0.9681764547507818	-0.8756467271770645	-0.7481329394415773	-0.39020973932846587	-0.29433020001393373	-0.21365780102426407	-0.1417572194131248	-0.10655291132316277	-0.09956439702077706	-0.07574743631494812	0.01503087932283309	0.23414162962062723	0.4575777917507876	0.5959341188880415	0.9094177968346551	1.020697477581405	1.098753199105602	1.1900867988617516	2.052402283798114	2.365274726235031	4.142506980772169	
In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />However, after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. With only one 'toilet humour' gag, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.<br /><br />The staple ingredients of a good film are all there; script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall.<br /><br />Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!	-2.030996337666264	-1.2828316524610655	-1.0640894130570184	-0.8649777439959835	-0.44395752087079965	-0.28772472284395173	-0.14830185155967954	-0.08070444604529814	-0.06337279361308026	0.1696884446254234	0.19804967686142622	0.2316998442131044	0.23206794801951205	0.2554944591460958	0.3301289444851774	0.38477149041301933	0.3954977500100779	0.6117775110506976	0.7841217763946527	0.8908604054206336	0.8919000525125346	0.9510335607361786	1.103637668026829	2.109916154120056	2.221218690743443	
As with all the other reviewers, this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I recall going to the library researching all that I could on this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. Despite all this, all I was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s.<br /><br />Fastward to 2002, after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was, a VHS copy of the movie. There was one other bidder but I was determined to win this movie. The losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which I gave her. Despite owning a copy, I still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie.

Plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption, murder, power and the rest of thriller related topics. Characters are interesting though sometimes. Not realistic but interesting nevertheless.<br /><br />Development is slow like tea drinking ceremony. Visuals not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye strain. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much, nothing overexciting. Movie sitcom style.<br /><br />I liked Woody - excellent performance. Had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good. The rest are bearable though very predictable. The whole is watchable and better than most TV shows.	-1.784863808149268	-1.6831108903523546	-1.629730589442495	-1.3054287041985602	-1.1550571101861433	-0.5762693948695595	-0.5684985879153042	-0.42135146582112976	-0.3302284761191916	-0.2768514720193759	-0.26325358188210035	-0.0011702347168120464	0.003300028330803201	0.18611738262126187	0.25154130015477716	0.29561705220570494	0.34630412175242065	0.5639477314512875	0.6007720639879099	0.9004266910093218	1.017189565004512	1.590898122665692	1.8816136211658065	2.2593460813628887	3.3966084235684515	
Ah, I loved this movie. I think it had it all. It made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times. Yes, I am a girl, so I'm writing this from a girl's perspective. I think it's a shame it only scored 5.2 in rating. Too many guys voting? It was far above other romantic comedies. Just because I'm female I don't enjoy all chic flicks, on the contrary I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be. But like I said, this movie had it all, almost, in my opinion. Great script, good one-liners, fine acting. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character reminded very much of Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives, but so what? It was awesome.

Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.<br /><br />The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes. Catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century England built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith. Not something you see in westerns, but a good gimmick.<br /><br />Unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought Wayne to this place exactly. But this was a B western and not even a good one at that.<br /><br />Gabby Hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the garrulous Gabby.<br /><br />If you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless Gabby Hayes then see this film.	-5.319870904162262	-2.4320898967663536	-2.054546792197395	-1.7988178207046335	-1.6385806857329164	-1.6238463764361264	-1.2122548846571646	-0.5967615830234849	-0.542953697401544	-0.29836521688848217	-0.2747850512191056	-0.13589216487937147	0.20802986239835247	0.2316539645245093	0.35545308829347066	0.4185606969510056	0.6388794834069828	0.6687138669781743	0.6963687903896209	0.6996243148058858	0.8578851202229286	0.9126220568359101	2.0245252898985124	2.761447141177579	5.650998788582789	
Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. Since I am a sci-fi buff the notion of a movie about UFOs interested me.<br /><br />Instead, this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical Christian propaganda flick. Appropriate for an audience of like-minded individuals but very un-Christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code did not hold back its wild-eyed craziness.<br /><br />So, this B-grade movie (and I am being kind) production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to Wednesday and Sunday evening youth groups. But if you are a mainline Christian or non-Christian you will not be comfortable.	-4.441774986383327	-2.05292230257307	-2.034609276706211	-1.857687372319738	-1.7971779190581119	-0.745594715942199	-0.4785803298886676	-0.38562125887943327	-0.37582223548957583	-0.37308305947451087	-0.29946553851307495	-0.17095268981820994	-0.09874697518478695	-0.041356361421638954	0.14205992695747158	0.37944370844530256	0.4066417584501556	0.4113875767653634	0.5201314249088473	0.6035678820926509	0.6779929107517811	0.8108041664233806	1.8616758112493597	2.151467799687627	4.629122161221205	
Here is a rundown of a typical Rachael Ray Show:<br /><br />1. The awful theme song begins to play, and Rachael descends wearing her Snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator. 2. She begins running around screaming and/or insulting the audience, then yells at them sit down. 3. An awkward monologue.<br /><br />(The next are in any order) 4. A segment tooting Rachael's own horn (i.e. "I Lost 500 Pounds with Rach's Recipes, "Rachael Ray Saved my Life," "Rachael's Fashion Tips.") 5. A totally useless D.I.Y. tip (i.e. how to engrave words into casserole dishes, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it.) 6. The unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience (reaction shots of first bites are never shown). 7. A celebrity guest with an awkward interview, followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience. 8. A person who gets help from one of Rachael's cronies (i.e. the I say yes to everything woman, the I own nothing but overalls lady, and the I can't find time to put on makeup housewife). What would they do without you Rachael. *gasp*<br /><br />Reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray claims that entire show is unscripted. Many people who have attended tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted. Many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. <br /><br />2. Her show jumps around too much: Where as Oprah, who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show, Rachael's jumps around like an ADHD soda child on crack. Her show averages perhaps 10, short, worthless segments a show. On second you will be getting fashion tips from Kojo, and the next Rachael will be making gross stuffed "Spanish" peppers with manchego cheese, and the next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage, and the next, well you get the picture.<br /><br />3. Rachael is a poor host with bad ideas: Aside from her grating personality, Rachael's hosting ability is terrible, at best. Her questions for her celebrity guests are poor, and often times not even relevant to the interview, and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational, or humorous value.<br /><br />In conclusion, you need not waste your time with this schlock. It will be canceled soon anyways.	-13.910603766254436	-6.987493424517821	-6.344922261005324	-5.048529494069815	-4.603555228353554	-3.054482476384854	-2.662230833339899	-2.1396142133144385	-1.7923841935817875	-1.7797282645950245	-1.576609976594208	-1.406905247523179	-0.9310300985501876	-0.9152267301339997	0.044065961193823174	0.1790665279585678	0.6419828793459024	0.8690908692658227	1.630300465365477	1.9462359048049984	2.1477754030446463	2.373736002162981	5.404606863492049	6.091084533614799	12.264798952866546	
Having seen most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. It's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is truely memorable. Sadly, Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on, even if you near the second biggest china-town in North America (like I do). If you can find it, don't pass it up.	-1.0957948545790017	-0.8282927993368868	-0.8190133929611861	-0.8080479232869147	-0.740499576711022	-0.6273786577389757	-0.5894295763958812	-0.24599725388990307	-0.10865591582547005	0.01201431393528881	0.07281691761498159	0.14908565297520712	0.20089928532769297	0.2096053307627726	0.22447163111510648	0.2673799223800816	0.33588315076048186	0.3435399045515052	0.5253902984757081	0.6960240614870273	0.7636857538259947	0.8617978458262994	1.4085215100648498	1.5869878467120555	2.628587118421731	
This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. From the opening 10 minutes, I was ready to leave. The cliches there slapping you in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but full of more holes than swiss cheese. I am considering suing for that lost 2 hours, and $6.25 along with the fact that I am now stupider for watching this waste of film. The T-Rex's must be flipping in their graves, so to speak.	-3.472577343926747	-1.7603331643780837	-1.6222265736379136	-1.4166843004383929	-1.3839334453588124	-1.1859550515082642	-1.1646700005326294	-0.35409058211003336	-0.26852492052564675	-0.15542512182447063	-0.13731855614760693	-0.12192413596873396	-0.06099500657470617	-0.02827388673255854	0.1016447637811687	0.10232300305918725	0.16333304539041768	0.18390310852709763	0.23307650835744848	0.6271093036182644	0.7514459740400913	0.7564080161752418	1.8055250406631311	1.909625989176668	3.557783603005329	
RUMORS is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring "Private Snafu." The films were aimed at servicemen and were directed, animated and scored by some of the top talent from Warner Bros.' Termite Terrace, including Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, and Carl Stalling. The invaluable Mel Blanc supplied the voice for Snafu, and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by Theodor Geisel, i.e. Dr. Seuss. The idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery, using the character of Snafu as a perfect negative example: he was the dope, the little twerp who would do everything you're NOT supposed to do. According to Chuck Jones the scripts had to be approved by Pentagon officials, but Army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes, certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow-- all for the greater good, of course.<br /><br />As the title would indicate, this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors. The setting is an Army camp. Private Snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine (something you won't see in any other Hollywood films of the era) and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling. We observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted, then exaggerated, then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp. The imagery is indeed vivid: the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot, while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air, i.e "balloon juice." A soldier "shoots his mouth off," cannon-style, and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction. Winged baloney, at that. Panicked soldiers tell each other that the Brooklyn Bridge has been pulverized, Coney Island wiped out, enemy troops have landed on the White House lawn, and the Japanese are in California. The visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for "Rumor-itis" and Private Snafu has been locked up in a padded cell.<br /><br />This is a highly effective piece of work. The filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy, and the message is still a valid one. In recent years we've seen that catastrophic events (real or imagined) can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances. Because the technology has improved, the Private Snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e-mail, cellphones and blogging. Consequently, RUMORS is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated; in fact it may be more timely than ever.	-3.2144086832644065	-2.8212421210246847	-2.517541232842104	-2.4118317669686404	-1.6352199651919972	-1.4801152777050457	-0.828933838398947	-0.39942009345325874	-0.2799330166013889	-0.24549665059637985	-0.19871489346045595	-0.053844067632035385	-0.008380153417099034	0.1566682532937199	0.3579941662582882	0.4893269010007808	0.7268462058876793	1.0042920938045239	1.288419050996779	1.8720048898103425	2.177443935309138	2.995278738749105	3.693038825421684	4.107304453508411	6.225332925643824	
It's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!	-2.8551896131274876	-1.4337788867590238	-1.2440813651679308	-1.2168329836293383	-1.210395461962071	-0.7851660518127129	-0.6862088853084981	-0.4481524487170929	-0.39901729463172475	-0.32005388595299966	-0.2184834317132155	0.02032008597889678	0.026808892355886266	0.06781530499284859	0.13058535805758748	0.1980855123477225	0.20327152262450968	0.3350649010270402	0.341075960754636	0.3525808234604248	0.437556714130157	0.5285776103719477	1.2019621314559852	1.5098224950141688	3.0339805289000563	
This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota and even I can't believe they dumped Cleveland. (Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League, but still be consistent.) Anyway I loved the first Major League, liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series. You can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. What Happened? Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk.	-1.358030909582429	-1.1588269146668009	-0.9381331698615257	-0.7234765839309938	-0.6643946731059224	-0.2820452630604039	-0.21456946256387996	-0.18222904356842176	-0.17495300877161726	-0.09667693145160737	0.052498601258752664	0.05521899382215495	0.06724504948501261	0.13093150119813196	0.165799104254641	0.23780838920758918	0.2518239321442707	0.27864322243069917	0.2795962054489231	0.36377081506175885	0.41030444505958913	0.6302133758523238	1.158864289408857	1.2773309553243977	2.5944954982200663

Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 British film, "The Man Who Knew Too Much". This 1956 take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next, thus keeping a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and George Tomasini's editing shows his talent. Ultimately, Bernard Herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the climax of the picture.<br /><br />James Stewart was an actor that worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version, he plays a doctor from Indiana on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they are on their way to Marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins. His wife is the lovely Doris Day at her best. She had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. The film has some good supporting cast, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among others, do a great job in portraying their characters.<br /><br />Although this is a "light Hitchcock", one can't dismiss it as a failure. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a change of pace for Hitchcock's fans.	-3.5605020747010356	-3.112661883001656	-1.5046770829701819	-1.2530722052410534	-1.1693451304519293	-0.13189913271988127	-0.020906366416677556	-0.011817566160572654	0.028098918181962453	0.3417006040791569	0.35913522006016746	0.4715018854728059	0.5920052763627723	0.7713253994786315	0.8097545651361338	0.8208122626775326	1.0965493675291897	1.1068335572172832	1.4336562682503906	1.5069294399996154	1.634825685031037	1.7103358643164714	2.0392290977697227	2.0870259758313234	4.257863007227985	
Totally ridiculous. If you know anything about poker, you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless. The nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker, but I doubt he's ever played above 3-6. (I think he also knows nothing of golf.) Where to start. I've seen better productions in the Intro to Film class I took freshmen year of film school. The actors to watch in this movie are Queen Momma, Scotty Nguyen, and the loser who can never win at poker. Everyone else is as wooden as they come, like bad porn actors.<br /><br />*Spoiler* The man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made. He is a railbird who doesn't play poker and never has a line of dialogue, but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie. I can't think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production. It's fitting that he had such a useless role.<br /><br />There's very little poker in this movie. Most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren't resolved in the slightest. Queen Momma does have a show-stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out. Also the nameless Arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them. Their subtle performances are easily among the film's highlights. It makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads.<br /><br />In conclusion, complete nonsense. Plan 9 from Outer Space has slightly more coherency. If you play poker though you might want to have a laugh. Also if you're Christian you might enjoy some of the heavy-handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper. I hate movies made by religious people. Especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about. It's sad that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen got involved in this travesty as I can't help but think less of them. They must be envious of Johnny Chan for getting in Rounders.	-10.999354771316003	-5.570554258056049	-5.500014194355702	-4.525970526408296	-4.280093572824902	-3.1576066787222166	-2.786324587820481	-0.5048575639065292	-0.48367042443493674	-0.3870173683196797	-0.1987492602762127	-0.02030242504474951	0.05148108812135717	0.07132441223534396	0.78123115496306	1.1312535787610412	1.3917089738173636	1.4389873800858382	1.7246500958678879	1.7257981245548453	2.3099439847987444	2.618813592124044	2.6271029778411887	7.025492025562918	12.835179263808069	
This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories (I note both of them are based on short stories). "Examination Day" is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves, huge TV-looking "phones" that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age...and the Examination Day, a point where 12-year-olds must undergo a government-required IQ test. The kid is this story, Dickie Jordan (David Mendenhall) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades. His parents (Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment), on the other hand, say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score, and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry, it's pretty obvious they are worried. I won't give anything away in the ending, but I will say this - there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject: that evening (or another?) his parents ask Dickie whether he'd prefer to watch TV all night. By today's standards, we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching...but why would his family ask this? The flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon (which I hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen). I only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was. I found it to be better than the short story it was based on. I haven't read the one that "A Message from Charity" was based on, but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year-ld boy, Peter (Robert Duncan McNeill) is suffering a fever from unclean water, that has always been common in his Massachusetts hometown...but he is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever, Charity Payne, (Kerry Noonann) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him. They both recover, especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985, but the connection doesn't go away. Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company, especially Peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he's been staying in one place at. Things take an unexpected turn, though, when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever (not so common in 1700). The two try to learn a way to save her. The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching. Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lesson/warning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would've cooked up and entertainment, make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship, love, and wisdom do a great deal. Probably 3/4 of this has no theme, but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterling's crew.	-3.475585301792334	-3.168673791494877	-2.5687003392947743	-2.210567840767193	-0.7831490874208371	-0.6019663055202322	-0.580751969414995	-0.5533947717894345	-0.5388585194363478	-0.3651910602046658	-0.3266035394596844	-0.156844763493935	-0.06580754354991454	0.08508155594038726	0.237022311937595	0.25449988103055454	0.4375351391471954	0.6113741006167607	0.7639236485764146	1.4064368761217947	1.4309311753038154	1.9720184200010467	3.081903052174023	3.7051615647132508	6.087250194638208	
Many funny scenes about the people that you don't normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do. Lou Myers was very funny as Half-Step Wilson. Any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non-movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie.	-0.5904770742105363	-0.3829152992051158	-0.2620296871171647	-0.20986983582966562	-0.10907730760409555	-0.08667104281367716	-0.06785138873040841	-0.06295086281029032	-0.002517603582900145	0.0022949424874735697	0.0036404470268109786	0.016897387820533266	0.05911011817071807	0.08877702784039831	0.12484357373329924	0.1422891766874313	0.14250582230919923	0.17107419455847692	0.20508475217454986	0.2307924510859328	0.232904508727391	0.23624467818652728	0.3859160258953327	0.4771216556691903	0.6521099499568536	
First of all, i have nothing against Christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! What a waste of believers' money. They'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. I don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this "movie", because I couldn't find any of those in this. Story's simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) for some sake has abandoned religion. B regains his confidence in religion and teaches A a lesson - believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie. People, do not believe the rating of this "movie", read reviews first. I didn't and wasted an hour of my life :( PS: Why is it classified as sci-fi? Because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky? PPS: U.F.O. = Satan's evil doings? That's a new one :)	-5.172167311386252	-2.480928264263819	-2.471218712957073	-2.335984424424685	-2.0160468834495124	-1.8303061013999968	-1.7072725545344032	-0.4130778521429096	-0.3908580379581543	-0.24459847737285	-0.21281514050263028	-0.19940334233511353	0.02004121000954558	0.13250160893191007	0.2562675516948338	0.25657510101242353	0.4620652276815299	0.48879909705688007	0.8553630783460712	1.0021650357128358	1.1754777621885293	1.2929009088938563	1.3857021095410371	3.230350973754738	6.528972284057749	
While it's not "perfect", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! "The baby swallowed the watch" was always my son's favorite line.<br /><br />Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan has a few great songs, too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah).	-2.5290480816811103	-1.4421789037253816	-1.048975614794703	-1.030109192110964	-0.48798111768310104	-0.36041006881703797	-0.307620833641208	-0.28916518371685446	-0.208217075336725	0.03849785433064377	0.18174669211344496	0.23351938744519682	0.3276924012963305	0.4255223552580683	0.46323425780044347	0.47521298658907	0.6126561895852628	0.7737374168195044	0.9458325634607113	0.9513776131046591	1.1315225032119942	1.2361461750606175	1.5531502637093286	1.6818691892729778	2.19567561357363	
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I could have stopped there and gone on with my life. She does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.<br /><br />I also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. If a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, I would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig. What bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it.<br /><br />I think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are. Guys will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all.<br /><br />Some women may hate me for this, but I hope not. I have much respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family for years, but I don't really feel this did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself, some women were offended by her project.	-3.2256841298365355	-2.036876871583095	-2.034565425788939	-1.6707725620076836	-1.4986262045740215	-1.0055290934668655	-0.8968150884979442	-0.8550834423971851	-0.4041317595472891	-0.17108810986402198	-0.12453608550673262	-0.09646040711230444	-0.06508996230664409	-0.014836377765022953	0.14658903217704702	0.29688847666238116	0.3131999975052615	0.4044992778076852	0.724153783353305	0.7381628264080808	1.037950308219091	1.0596171040572528	1.5066717422893052	2.4460296995929744	4.612454475080092	
Can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a South Carolina town? The answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap, James Kennedy, understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene. Also, the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart.<br /><br />"Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula film inspired on a true story. Yet, the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast.<br /><br />Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man, who is called Radio because his passion for collecting them, involved in sports, a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life. Coming from a poor background, Radio, lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions. Radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot, at first, then, his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body.<br /><br />The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who make a great pair as the coach and Radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence. He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does interesting work as the mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays the high school principle with style. Debra Winger, only has a few scenes in the film.<br /><br />"Radio", while being sentimental, will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us.	-2.9193854595543214	-2.52761699953051	-2.4851307761884613	-1.245260798190472	-0.7322846660270644	-0.5074721300266407	-0.487858236815074	-0.4038798656980479	-0.2007950763243107	0.1576396798523981	0.32978070786745983	0.3315692364550697	0.44200451184133277	0.6058522889259699	0.6551782076576977	0.7132577717359311	0.7900548474889297	0.9584553362952585	1.0294082401525848	1.2432907494835843	1.5163781275484602	1.872454183997035	2.7941874868959395	3.842091460150563	5.074093928382964	
Stanley Kubrick, a director who I hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, the Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc) took the film out of circulation, leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists. After seeing the film for myself, I could see why. At the age of 24, Kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for LOOK magazine, and had done a few short documentaries. Like many first-time filmmakers that came in the decades after him, his ambition for Fear and Desire was, in short, to just go and make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if he could do it. On that level, he was successful. However, the film itself definitely is not.<br /><br />I can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something I did like about it throughout. Even as the film's story went on the wayside, and the actors (whom Kubrick didn't have any idea how to direct, not being a man of the theater), his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film. At times, there are some shots of close-ups and quick-shots in suspense/action scenes that are eye-catching. Unfortunately, this is all the good I can really say of the film. Although there are a couple of 'name' actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also appeared in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances overall are dull and very routine.<br /><br />In fact, that is the film's main demise for me; whenever I watch any Kubrick film, even his early film noirs Killer's Kiss and the Killing, I can tell who made it, as his style by then became distinct, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. It wasn't 'artsy' like I might have pictured (which is usually the case with first-time directors like Scorsese and Spielberg), but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn't Kubrick, it felt like a lot of the time I was watching some B (or even C) grade movie by a director that time forgot- not quite 'Ed Wood' bad, but close. The music is as standard as can be, the fades are pedestrian, and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention.<br /><br />In short, as others have said and which I can agree, this is a "doodle pad" of a future ground-breaker, who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention (the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend except to those, like myself, who end up seeing everything by Kubrick (or, perhaps, have to see every ultra-low budget war film ever made), if only out of curiosity.	-6.951617880408042	-3.5553755295400764	-3.2995454338205663	-2.89930261036585	-2.760011608603333	-2.3734553311097857	-2.0151076988993917	-1.1506307119739985	-0.8905116468951866	-0.38825490329489065	-0.35430995195358184	-0.30252577554922594	-0.06924890618771304	0.3461467405270672	0.5359895574128501	0.5813859004518718	0.6650512824380759	1.0959993508216834	1.0992886669187756	1.2379372928397505	1.4179080467322762	1.6222057361662696	1.8256730978714795	3.7418613388538278	7.958608119791438	
I stumbled across this (Act-I) by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago. This was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned. It amazed me. It intimidated me. It shocked me. I eventually forgot about and almost a decade later, I happened to think about it again. Then went and bought both acts. They were even better than I had experienced at first.<br /><br />My only complaint is that while the Tank Police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime, warranting tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals. That is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time. If that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly has not been shown as such.<br /><br />I don't think the original Japanese version could have been any where as good as the Americanized version of this. But regarding the story, there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused.	-5.230510680969249	-2.3673720269720047	-2.349925945554773	-1.6139962841159003	-1.5171667203868646	-1.4412573979742218	-1.3520272738722128	-0.6785340166146361	-0.5725588986633322	-0.5543269474023266	-0.05200452360511112	-0.022257291026964502	0.23742557792282903	0.24748046974639953	0.2510174677437059	0.4142025757791205	0.41658213284665613	0.4999769859936646	0.51503772630865	0.6042044101432648	0.9033870162588279	1.065925803748273	2.1193427469455624	2.322250334508222	5.412731466388948	
I'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie I've ever seen!<br /><br />I have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings)... the only thing I can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions:<br /><br />1. While being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2. They've received hard cash for the votes 3. Under gunpoint<br /><br />I can't believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.	-2.9641718515748194	-1.4414565298753854	-1.3720607560938844	-1.3377302371868445	-1.3307477695459626	-0.8029694799304619	-0.7789376638202836	-0.3092302386849972	-0.22029427367636495	-0.20285515660247208	-0.17161929559226552	-0.1284849820012933	-0.07934129206754648	-0.04958309342706485	-0.014579428234243394	0.084041834290808	0.15294779077927959	0.161855214064756	0.2855131229143724	0.4118560589171384	0.4869528359901653	0.5483972031651101	0.9410448537821873	1.3576176620734728	3.006246386872683	
At the surface COOLEY HIGH is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece (set in the early 60's, complete with a flawless Motown soundtrack). But there's SO much more to this film - it gets better every time I see it. The cast of unknowns (at the time) is excellent, and it is notable as an all-black-cast film that doesn't fall into any Blaxpoitation clichés - at times COOLEY HIGH almost feels like an updated, urban neo-realist film, with lots of edgy humor added in. At times, the rather tight budget does show, but the constraints actually serve the film well - there's a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar-minded films (like Schultz' later CAR WASH, which was more popular, but largely pointless) Warm-hearted but also true-to-life, this might be one of THE sleepers of the 70s - celebrated at the time, it seems that few film freaks know about this one today. Their loss - this is a fine, fine film.<br /><br />The bare-bones pan-and-scan DVD (no widescreen!?!) is testament to just how little cared-for this excellent film is.	-2.7014923991867894	-1.2434149287171106	-0.8124633032433435	-0.7842369541002159	-0.5335268133870962	-0.3782519253651939	-0.2630651666438074	-0.1859113865904363	-0.07359656369015642	0.00652289618116976	0.08114586993192413	0.08269438439264176	0.10164362388090357	0.34813313092845327	0.35946805065121856	0.44856795110361325	0.6031977020123268	0.9534006116049767	0.9709432721475788	0.9869973075818693	1.3950089455209331	1.5785143205433727	1.6716970555858897	2.152420534181211	2.358181010541274

To me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies with NO idea of what is going to happen, so therefore I think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers!<br /><br />I just watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the BEST ending to any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The real translation, 'The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings', is oddly not used as the translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans wouldn't know what Chaos Theory is (except for those who saw or read "Jurassic Park"). The movie is based on chaos theory, and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead back to one event. The movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect, as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it is a perfect ending. Think to yourself, "what else needed to be said"? It is at the same time a very brave ending. Too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one, but an ending like this would NEVER come out of Hollywood.<br /><br />	-3.639815662712805	-2.9786625342922592	-2.5789831849797777	-1.6205312076612262	-0.9839636867790909	-0.7539519254808268	-0.6764108624088961	-0.676373431719252	-0.5700151075095548	-0.299042349349948	-0.2951900113560282	-0.21952640689916553	-0.12857796803911922	-0.09783972720822057	-0.03929898563530111	0.18497009773525494	0.250596940304321	0.3798640473763819	0.5280453783142528	0.8727938033272504	0.9281863238078185	1.1840097259508078	1.196306945771048	2.6080991505988376	4.149847105221783	
Unlike many, I don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive. Its execution, however, is another matter entirely. Like so many B-minus movies, all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers. For most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor. Or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers. With a couple of exceptions the acting is awful; the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a Canadian one.) Notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle, I cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies. The final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town (Why? are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown Regina exteriors? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by the CBC's publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.	-5.591011295164149	-2.6177952070324144	-1.9926499457611822	-1.9652475063198458	-1.9097883938571636	-1.5224581085306508	-1.500701537004476	-1.208558018560662	-0.9919351897759888	-0.45383201665537404	-0.23801536144690322	-0.1838400765640037	-0.14978809365840415	-0.04870872832808998	0.08914983413524774	0.14967959600697361	0.45860348418148345	0.4726137267288768	0.5444473554219287	0.7113570936234976	0.9865808751551026	1.0364180865767225	1.8674750277778216	3.1029505216207167	5.870326270452647	
Richard Abernethie, a very wealthy man, has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral. Included in the funeral party is Abernathie's youngest sister Cora Galaccio. While none of the family has seen Cora in at least 20 years, they all agree that Cora was always a bit different. So when Cora says something about Abemethie having been murdered, most laugh it off as one of Cora's eccentricities. But someone is obviously taking Cora seriously. The next day, Cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently. Is there a connection between the two deaths? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer.<br /><br />After the Funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire Poirot series. I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and, from what I remember, the movie is as faithful to Christie's source material as any of the Poirot installments. The mystery is top notch with plenty of clues, suspects, and red herrings. And as I've written before, I always enjoy an Christie story where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal. It might be old fashioned, but that's the way I like it. Getting beyond the plot, technically and artistically After the Funeral is a winner. Sets, editing, direction, and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies. The acting is equally impressive. I've come to expect an enjoyable performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he doesn't disappoint here. The rest of the cast is just as strong with Monica Dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance. Other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced, I've got no real complaints. It's a good show all the way around.	-4.357006907720849	-3.833504270254847	-3.536939161720696	-2.983236765005638	-1.3804901340070344	-1.176556761272918	-1.1219486772391767	-0.8794554022460228	-0.18106380067566086	-0.0063027720314837166	-0.001601311664114105	0.13810544641295064	0.16365085387682826	0.5933589835596678	0.6069327983767028	1.1006317253394013	1.3068326224910718	1.490259540353529	1.6944550370366616	1.994689627905025	2.040771277579949	2.2609069975169693	5.0164376532153225	5.342459303945928	6.541915892042239	
This show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years. I will sadly miss it. Although Atlantis has filled the hole a small bit.<br /><br />The last ever episode of SG1(on television anyway)was beautifully done. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show. (Everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up's and downs. But over the years they've turned into a family). I thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms.<br /><br />SG1 was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From episode one I was hooked. The blend of action, science, drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more.<br /><br />There are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. It has inspired me to do many things that I thought was impossible.<br /><br />I look forward to the movies next year and I really hope there will be a number of them. I never want the show to die.<br /><br />Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?	-4.00652772765814	-3.0605649174829463	-2.285298330220319	-1.8638708162753863	-1.8225483169864756	-0.7098514498863202	-0.5200607208164172	-0.491350693256698	-0.1209369897387846	-0.01772797000385999	0.1678722262633456	0.2854210650504786	0.4175662452687834	0.615538661501164	0.7125510419819331	0.733236207361809	0.9508667111835514	1.2762186556357442	1.301112072228712	1.3181397286653844	1.3501659123899914	1.578690429324977	3.924485413080727	4.588081904300033	6.472554934076527	
A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to draw WWF champion Rip into the squared circle to face off against Zeus for the championship of the 'Battle of the Tough Guys'. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced.<br /><br />Normally I would give Hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn't ask the Hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably. 'Tiny' Lister made a good effort as the mighty Zeus, but even his work left the film lacking something, namely acting!<br /><br />Watch this movie, if you so desire, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in.	-2.3822181996965632	-1.3682540551276428	-1.2988574641635564	-1.2367838278878036	-1.063524092739601	-0.41247185318504664	-0.27602850338392426	-0.27250052957207355	-0.2573991443009617	-0.23904756069881106	-0.19377893020747533	-0.14503493364717004	-0.14103166022100155	-0.10013284664893012	0.019296029682908125	0.029245943337743927	0.03487973264688474	0.21237395877641257	0.3797980440187929	0.4636738735302971	0.4823404276388089	0.7197048264493234	0.8456714583954978	1.479298078316824	2.651904315648094	
First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue" traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison. Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie. I mean she maintains zero interest, with zero believability. The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village. This is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti-war propaganda, that it comes across as simply long, outrageous, and contrived. Not recommended. - MERK................................

This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. Just the other day I was reminded of this movie by something on TV. It came back to me like a dam flooding over. I have never been more touched by a movie than by this one. After the movie was over I actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours. No movie has ever moved me that way before. I was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping I can find a copy to buy so that I can watch it whenever I want to. If someone suggests you see this movie with them, GO....you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Peggy Fries	-2.5850591918669372	-2.249102890345877	-1.7380736504074705	-1.6655515503401428	-0.8227768237278382	-0.765718123204195	-0.6385088616326635	-0.5191220637976469	-0.4539044689499063	-0.322827190395185	-0.1267907526405355	-0.12124355026114786	0.03865132860538387	0.14352103791208373	0.20105031017798008	0.2945446818394006	0.43790669312394864	0.6667250452479373	0.691928003875643	0.7093218716586638	0.861757667306189	1.1233348565856827	2.337258314158916	2.488617541678049	4.062848759201919	
San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits. In this one, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. They didn't even manage the most basic of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie. You will not be thinking "oh, I've been there," you will be thinking "how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of the leads used East Coast speech styles and affectations. It detracts, but the acting was always competent.<br /><br />The stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles, at least in the beginning. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, ripped scene for scene from classy Hong Kong action movies. The originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and paced better. But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminaries.<br /><br />The white boy intro was pointless. I think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and cut it down. The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley liberal - really, folks, everyone knows it's not "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous. They threw away some good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the West Coast, a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in New York. They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable. That would have been interesting; this was not.<br /><br />The Hunter's Point intro was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco. You've seen it done before and you've seen it done better. Even the video game was better! <br /><br />Despite the generic non-locality and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction... about ten minutes before the ending. Good concept placed in the wrong hands.<br /><br />PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.	-6.99068431196203	-4.73940017879641	-4.235929322026828	-3.9039300329804734	-2.798681710133964	-2.466802114343555	-2.253685034923499	-1.2116572090188777	-0.9232401830077174	-0.7360936084767709	-0.4033491581379027	-0.3373751050367622	0.01626252290520605	0.3644247057730958	0.583781149409594	0.6688451481264068	1.1705022581344362	1.6637400605782073	1.7343133450448394	1.914729353545924	2.167364658072048	2.7892646359172466	4.059789314913306	6.47580803569879	10.8417780994212	
Cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise. Elizabeth Shue Actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in Hollywood. I literally vomited while watching this film. Of course I had the flu, but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode. <br /><br />Why can't Nick Cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor. Nick Cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor. Heck nobody could do it better.<br /><br />The search begins for Nick's contract with Lucifer or was it Lou Cipher from "Night Train To Terror".	-2.8387322883899384	-1.5427383069179101	-1.2597307325698162	-1.0738725576994732	-0.9244810998393672	-0.526203033356882	-0.4890724973763393	-0.432708924262264	-0.35960463466148895	-0.3129261962079311	-0.22247964409951132	-0.21232701545393723	-0.13188187444547722	-0.10454551185566466	0.1186668560274114	0.1388938935372764	0.44243225036928957	0.5679550573001894	0.6017973221849751	0.6083350660004683	0.6385458158035952	0.7238804966085315	0.7661892939061428	1.7359761830419305	3.207623157105143	
"Yesterday" as a movie, is hard to rate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is gritty and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.<br /><br />As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the Zulu. But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film. It takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of "Yesterday". <br /><br />Unlike the 1980 film "The Gods Must be Crazy", which was a comic look at one African culture encountering modern technology, "Yesterday" has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience. The movie simply is not fit for the common western mind - and I doubt it was intended for the western mind. The scenes are long and slow, the editing is not paced for a 60mph+ instant gratification world. The dialog is not cleaver or witty, it is real. Movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment, it is education.<br /><br />This movie is best viewed by those who know, appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub-Sarah Africa. If you lack a broad enough world-view to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, should skip this film. Do not waste you time with it. Go see "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy" instead for your cross culture viewing.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of African cultures. For the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world, I would give it a 7.	-3.7717683351616875	-3.603698435166316	-3.503398329000462	-3.4933019624960093	-2.785013495668508	-1.7289799318158667	-1.4310762748220038	-1.333176255325832	-1.1005745469949018	-0.4911207106481646	0.05263262503588138	0.14356847194086286	0.5371149726427005	0.5444932133575576	0.5539513750679395	0.6453552844052214	0.7796598491431368	0.8096269800092801	0.8696773750153401	1.6938500865122348	2.1759488334224018	2.3800791668043653	3.3696564857660016	4.771663272188758	8.017848218693604	
I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations...until now! BURNING PARADISE doesn't contain the flat humor most HK movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some "intelligent" space (the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me). There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one(which is one of the coolest I have ever seen, yet so short) to the last main scenes! But mind, there's also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, decapitated, etc). The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical (notice: the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall!). Yep, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director!

What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining. "Right to Die" is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore.<br /><br />Spoilers here: <br /><br />Top credits also go to the dead-on performance from Martin Donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. Playing the character in a great "aloof" fashion, you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts.<br /><br />End of Spoiler.<br /><br />As a revenge-from-the-dead flick, "Right to Die" benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an OK way to spend less than an hour.	-2.235907585681475	-1.7641783774441102	-1.5649853638963092	-1.2689608575329094	-1.0298287675487738	-0.7912894288970433	-0.6268942455355231	-0.5702870993502518	-0.21922506451945833	-0.1500929806966118	-0.09970003995986006	-0.058479226301847265	0.031182215512161077	0.10104555900854861	0.12372354687278415	0.3178659938742519	0.3509941780960729	0.35704962764110343	0.5585110286460834	0.7981350935046003	0.8784419244285501	0.9152540834885804	0.942805924845102	1.6403951640303076	3.295290596694295	
The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print for television viewing. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic DVD version. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theatrical cut. However, even as released on DVD, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century Australia. After having toured the Old Melbourne Gaol, with death masks of convicts on display, it is "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to mind.	-3.0728166876579732	-1.156964629528299	-1.022258525217116	-1.0026489955866023	-0.8580055030261813	-0.7929720868505951	-0.5171877990065966	-0.5043050675593856	-0.46320537806528506	-0.41202379793941657	-0.3432051400132532	0.009744164467363056	0.04958843415705125	0.10921669863269609	0.13809203316357668	0.22770659920456876	0.2500178326303576	0.26524080526033367	0.38189665696998343	0.4673288772565	0.54876003807388	0.5699474272334015	1.1286931644913365	1.252056740907912	3.067404133913622	
Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting horrible, but the special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" make-up was the worst I have seen. If you can even call it make-up ( black eye shadow around the eyes) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover. Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about. do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying "This movie sucks, don't waste your time, return NOW" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie! i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, t should be in the negative	-4.263750175727263	-2.003296546699354	-1.714365107171481	-1.5905126340241644	-1.5665499555599307	-0.9862683933649159	-0.9379303967371134	-0.8215310490211039	-0.7459881689942851	-0.2909760193961909	-0.251666111284253	-0.18694846452122124	-0.13737642210905643	-0.0853492133284337	-0.030485596395371593	0.2511193107190435	0.36210885452317093	0.4769652983855323	0.5445120715989592	0.6118521683838147	0.8774415072606002	0.9221035974608334	0.982170002409287	1.947558180640158	4.081058886199147	
Homelessness (or Houselessness as George Carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets.<br /><br />But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless? That is Goddard Bolt's lesson.<br /><br />Mel Brooks (who directs) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bet's on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk. He's given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. They're survivors. Bolt isn't. He's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight, kill or be killed.<br /><br />While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasn't necessary to plot, I found "Life Stinks" to be one of Mel Brooks' observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.<br /><br />Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.	-5.388877337370622	-2.133194037347803	-2.1023888179740036	-1.8219471395860647	-1.7417339055808734	-1.4113752114534175	-1.0024670426297047	-0.7764629760815444	-0.7621388213844278	-0.6435997468038964	-0.40249821239119504	-0.009818314446039839	0.06659617752946446	0.18857412933599235	0.2212206839221297	0.22753041951845498	0.48010994523174805	0.5504652308709354	0.6249091315927285	0.6651736664330351	0.7463700795271891	1.1490100174146636	2.0585153078285265	2.567456431792222	5.56420926521156	
The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is hilarious. Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write. The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan. I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.	-3.5807336056300167	-1.9619964788042301	-1.8621576565329645	-1.643495798077651	-1.4153580127692453	-1.302055745094227	-0.9678918632844823	-0.5162234949335353	-0.3123850023958279	-0.24149679799474708	-0.24072928463502782	-0.14182176829135715	0.20173360023918296	0.29192933757954237	0.35525490159128137	0.3589002906082381	0.38145568000223784	0.4715081614405062	0.5584082720267548	0.6447980244006536	0.8174265936497411	0.9577870440377514	1.0705709829551502	2.6690002472769234	4.692488435259417	
This is a wonderful thriller I watched many times and never can get enough of.It's all about the obsessive love 5 people have for eachother in Paris, (un)lucky coincidences, false identities.The music makes it really gripping.There are hardly any flaws in the characters,just the end is not very credible,but a definite "must-see" still.	-0.8109037714271848	-0.5600110389027961	-0.36039455362748085	-0.1749381912758871	-0.15596898224713732	-0.0390770987008774	-0.018913844490437183	0.01077603953136614	0.013905407840555323	0.01686677527603264	0.022343416151597843	0.06913966813555332	0.09570663904167102	0.1329885611676225	0.1659067392212915	0.17327033316373247	0.2537171197117175	0.2560906450713751	0.2724452434083211	0.3045762166550989	0.3498770087602776	0.3673281430931175	0.4545018585260536	0.7325130984871486	0.7401546669692994	
Totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor. I loved it!!! It is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film, except for Nicolas Read, who plays an un-dead Court Jester, to comic brilliance. But being that as it may, I laughed so many times and I have to hand it to the film makers, it wasn't pretentious or ordinary in any way. Raping, fighting, zombies vomitting on their rape victims. What other movie has this? Not for the quesy, but with a pizza, a bong, and a six pack of beer, you got it made, if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself.	-1.4023609139146753	-1.3913473669272043	-1.349367197055967	-1.2133724261303953	-0.7926779649422206	-0.518586601370983	-0.4645770833790373	-0.3177951160965113	-0.29667926201301587	-0.275710509518852	-0.2508864810977419	-0.10557468523875778	-0.05540258250200155	0.007235636442657532	0.05413270726497275	0.17974683297707916	0.3772393899839677	0.4233784907465996	0.48861651103177844	0.5410909159727368	0.6007283436006166	0.7108079840994362	1.0924520815607561	1.6833818351841097	2.198553694623393	
This is probably the worst film I have ever seen; it makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look wonderful. The acting is wooden, the plot silly and the SFX non-existent. The only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film. The scenery is sometimes quite pretty, assuming you like trees, if that helps any!	-2.1602436789417485	-1.2953630364467703	-1.143650795908372	-1.089129407877002	-1.0731848367717671	-0.4919054495543761	-0.31793111235478305	-0.31523182599055427	-0.29400536053892073	-0.2923878714626263	-0.23532245144323274	-0.12693807875348023	0.039416510580803935	0.060760448214680296	0.1631810251185497	0.17774320149998776	0.20309970963374246	0.2374963976944259	0.29273267577123546	0.5104952603533335	0.5663491604846239	0.5848032370931178	0.7242282212101532	1.5923005307293543	2.512023161077488	
'The Curse of Frankenstein' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley's story for one word of the title, which wouldn't be so bad if the changes were any good at all. The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein's family has been completely excised and replaced with... nothing. The heart and moral centre of the story is gone. It doesn't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving, devious murderer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichés. Even taken on its own terms, this is rubbish: a bland, rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut. As it's the first of Hammer's horror films, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, its place in horror history is secure. But it's crap.	-4.986146970011663	-2.346104661127614	-2.0415901232684934	-2.0391406694640506	-1.9042041324374512	-1.6288200561244874	-1.5519575359148143	-0.40071723200635245	-0.24721777925792365	-0.19973813010629785	-0.14160578324838802	-0.11000125037576818	-0.07958351970086813	-0.020023767162586942	0.0812076723726333	0.10304927238674738	0.35360170185654466	0.5552851313201443	0.604129925300555	0.6273623789080403	0.6987438369684702	0.9652363309979823	2.345198817877417	2.832863852682352	5.260903296929765	
Felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines: "A ham, A ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich!!!" The dramatic guy that tells Felix he'll "have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies." He's in tears. Felix just looks at him like he's nuts, and shrugs his shoulders. The old guy tells Felix to "go ye forth" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, "How does he expect me to get the money?"<br /><br />In minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he spots a shoe business owner putting up a "bankrupt" sale on his store. Felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $500 if it works.<br /><br />Well, it does but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In an outrageous scene, Felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that's how he gets to Hollywood, transforming himself back to cat when they get there.<br /><br />We then witness Felix's attempts at getting into show business. His audition scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives. In all, quite a bit of material is in this 9.5- minute cartoon. It's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes, assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length.<br /><br />At any rate, there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon, like Felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! Crazy stuff.	-4.276841276261879	-2.896513386972773	-2.1111115623014856	-1.813668592754903	-1.6139867402149721	-1.0805058727576171	-0.8482884562893578	-0.8040888924532379	-0.7161411055026115	-0.21248927431211567	-0.16634052724262544	-0.06544749958518711	0.06780747505528828	0.12061799568397161	0.170886332419072	0.2684861486411968	0.6200502155613046	0.6883770202930474	1.1134912446324319	1.130360297058435	1.1857045569762612	1.3806532278876098	2.1777142861357937	2.755719929177137	5.1649633912584125	
I took a flyer in renting this movie but I gotta say, it was very, very good. On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc. Proves Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in rom/com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who mug and call it acting. Who'da thunk it?<br /><br />Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as "Over Her Dead Body." Lake Bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time I have seen her. And finally, Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really good movie, instead of lesser films.<br /><br />A movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males. It's too bad. As other IMDb reviewers here have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack writing or acting. <br /><br />And its depiction of contemporary L.A. and California, in general, makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean, and otherwise outstanding in every way. Never before has a movie made L.A. look so good. Ah, what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie.<br /><br />I won't divulge the plot, but as a long-time and hard-core atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment. It reminds me very much of the old "Topper" movies, which were also so enjoyable.<br /><br />This movie exposes popular, but otherwise hackneyed, movies like "Ghost" for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are. We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre. Some of us save our praise for the truly worthy, however.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" with JoBeth Williams, "Chances Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right" with John Malkovich, etc., you'll enjoy this. <br /><br />A first-rate job all around (even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.) But even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence.	-4.326161463226806	-3.5776429872694755	-3.508298342445271	-2.6840474918040815	-2.519516621946865	-1.8322306858594941	-1.4708024769488781	-1.2157373794566932	-0.49723065521894666	0.08097836757600968	0.12283250001621664	0.32953690117417644	0.560495033725415	0.6216131999298052	0.6329885495150688	0.7636325369030786	0.9963853459970092	1.1498307360957194	1.4246600233185887	1.5245038839407206	1.645095022261981	2.582106229324673	4.5692374818790755	5.102132614231877	8.23794850138743	
The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a two-piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan  the mega-disappointing, mind-numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend. Bad films are bad films and we see some every week, but Tashan is not just a bad film, it's a terrible film. Terrible because it takes its audience for granted, terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they've got big movie stars onboard.Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tashan is what you'd describe as a road movie, but one that's going in all the wrong directions. Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff, a call-centre executive who's hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji - that's Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster, desperate to go cool. Jimmy's got his eye on Pooja, the gangster's pretty young assistant (played by Kareena Kapoor), who uses Jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees. Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja, Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job. So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey, the gangster's faithful aide from Kanpur, who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that's hidden across the length and breadth of the country.Much like those bad eighties potboilers, Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot. But the treatment's so over-the-top, so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect. Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three-act structure, you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed. That garish item song in the desert, the bullet-dodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort, Kareeena's bikini moment, even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks, a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala, and believe it or not, even a Dhanno-style horse-driven tonga. In all fairness, not all these set pieces are badly done - the item song in the desert is quite neat actually - but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture, because you're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really. Little do you expect in a seemingly fast-paced road movie, to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts.You see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making. What's more, I don't think they cared either - the film reeks of arrogance. Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work, Tashan is like an overcooked stew.There are films that kill you softly, and then there's Tashan, a film that kills you with excess. Packaged snazzily with glossy-finish camera-work, exotic locations and fancy costumes, every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together, but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn't hold. Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow doesn't help either because they don't blend with the film's wafer-thin plot. One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging, but Anil Kapoor's grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists, and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly, unable to find his feet. Kareena Kapoor, meanwhile, queen of over-the-top delivery, does a decent job. But of course, if Tashan is salvaged to some extent, it's thanks to Akshay Kumar's irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character. You cringe when he's cupping his crotch repeatedly, and you scowl when he delivers those double-meaning dialogues, but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he's up there.Despite some good music from Vishal-Shekhar, the songs seem like they're only prolonging your misery. Well that's because Tashan is a test of your patience. In case you didn't know, Tashan means style. I'm sorry to say, this film has none.	-13.439791399143159	-7.988418882338316	-7.625763701556193	-7.2617915809028055	-7.0245746744290045	-2.9320291975389248	-2.595871099584538	-2.2421801392537213	-1.668296686646352	-1.4280410318481767	-0.9614730849174495	-0.7763758149708057	-0.3736402284075056	-0.22118370552499694	0.6472100705976431	0.6776593990806119	0.8703255796736264	1.2571376218153367	1.600221784553648	2.0354369996495403	2.561647372453147	3.5067127782594643	4.088864864440399	8.21788525515339	14.084671259943883	
While I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its horrid production values), it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it?! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the BETTER episodes!! After many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess! I can see why in the live-action Scooby-Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy-Doo--since practically everyone hates him!	-4.03312860872538	-2.0592047764551995	-1.8699043341923716	-1.7309737839529802	-1.6865117723916094	-1.5661756818594639	-1.236046661483975	-0.6580433006313029	-0.36430917440636	-0.14199524269168196	-0.07354357554290011	0.03650522844151188	0.059488163619649634	0.07425726216506753	0.09784268477040975	0.1802617485796455	0.21302292667237777	0.4010169782874376	0.47781784099532554	0.535447598817376	0.6794179784047478	0.8980923435789091	1.660126121117774	2.4343752089185133	4.3710623094403465	
Beginning with the poster (featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the entire movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing - or nothing new, at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop-flick.<br /><br />Basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some city, all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town, under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician. The almighty and above-the-law organization is called FRAT and guess what? they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. One hour later, after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system. Bah! Don't see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 min altogether!	-5.630908697706208	-2.5824822027309224	-2.2514196276523255	-1.9151638321532267	-1.7796709666023534	-1.4228899123695877	-1.0912079868755726	-0.7214166349393835	-0.6596935498038528	-0.5357279290222647	-0.478646114696656	-0.17837559094856056	-0.08355047931728565	-0.07102499786995224	-0.03641271838797804	0.3127823095320976	0.4765940936621278	0.5467690001848565	0.7147259786623523	0.7712293493229953	0.8976266095346608	1.0597893135859595	2.05077107469046	2.3786499252266524	5.301717290549678	
New York family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set, which nearly ruins David Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. Bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom(and nothing sexy happens there anyway). Gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on, she turns off. Film's sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky Patty Duke, pre-"Miracle Worker", as Niven's daughter. She's delightful; "Happy Anniversary" is not. * from ****	-1.1681149435503124	-0.7702412183806953	-0.5437214374614916	-0.29658967732037683	-0.29344703425014734	-0.26790572316861494	-0.26225453054119363	-0.24019317275926652	-0.2390836288030559	-0.2377906433548524	-0.21633768967506578	-0.08920795223614351	-0.07739145297163158	-0.02502150877154824	0.15052516250510597	0.24001393377221422	0.2510363908160893	0.2528104917767146	0.29458694172403604	0.36761969863586513	0.38065458904000893	0.396245251228004	0.5277275048148938	0.9042332838705522	1.4326589908263248	
Zombie Nation 2004 R<br /><br />Hey, I was bored. I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description. Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film. I could've used that advice.<br /><br />Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed. It has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city. This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible (he has to be trying to suck this much), while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them. Yup, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it. This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison. He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy. They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing. The women then act very poorly and take their revenge. Oh yay.<br /><br />This film was crap in every category. Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. The women don't look zombie-like, unless you count really dark make-up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human. The gore is weak compared to even many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief. You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence... Then the exact same breasts later! Go figure. Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite. The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set-up and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing. Steer clear, it's a waste of time.<br /><br />1/10	-14.165237763231707	-7.499890736480351	-6.994627753216117	-5.842779267454964	-5.833069356038656	-5.788147767624063	-4.179831211291465	-1.1412276332867892	-1.1002746254099083	-0.6181741557687281	-0.6077986614257063	-0.40207750690988	-0.004586592678817558	0.154006188219017	0.18026351427848925	1.0551606944381418	1.2793249654841792	1.3276571634148862	1.419027394316351	1.489028616493674	2.616355799920238	2.9444773097156345	4.767595499783415	8.521499635947821	15.450709523385438	
Like an earlier commentor, I saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story, splendid acting, and dramatic musical score. It certainly contains some of Sam Waterston's finest work. He and the writers depict Oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero -- which he was -- but also as naive, fond of alcohol, and snobbish, a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype.	-1.0849016504380569	-0.9351290810903503	-0.6301294203875718	-0.5283353056095024	-0.3620112628225118	-0.12870814730776647	-0.09000561880043001	-0.07409271047707955	0.057921777031572044	0.06318938042488975	0.06552350312818792	0.06698449597919573	0.07477313573184936	0.08045912954671916	0.14743199268938564	0.14772489386572413	0.1508619101899178	0.1994985672776326	0.2532676044265735	0.2861025566213423	0.36993710302721494	0.609660334767469	0.7442262724907337	1.130830851732777	1.14340518514976	
I have seen the short movie a few years ago. After that I watch all sequels. The first one is really not the best - but it's the most popular one. I've already watch the making of Guinea Pig 1. It's really great what these guys did. Also the sequels are excellent in the special effects. Take your chance to watch it!	-1.9603976217216696	-1.6751694928674008	-0.8349145627351106	-0.7497095871086763	-0.42772264603849497	-0.3584264330861159	-0.17918287194675284	-0.14533134122177577	-0.0514737690553268	0.07750469728763743	0.08182008193659995	0.10719952529937102	0.30087735031322504	0.341379304771633	0.3493226785992137	0.4165546660547748	0.42315016140326583	0.4591472442545582	0.4628729675426702	0.611617581986377	0.6609679520162839	0.8274412639418415	1.0525644734242325	1.227894257578281	2.0010486380114223	
A wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups. Yes, they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the Hollywood fluff. This all under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them dwarfed by the surroundings with long wide shots. It is great to see that there is lust in the mid-life crises sector.	-1.481196923726555	-1.2131546794430732	-0.7337450948505266	-0.7023171932769064	-0.3222703530928433	-0.14158915423065058	-0.1365372829631638	-0.02255220543812927	0.03280921990323665	0.03426182310120429	0.11294887304372679	0.2083118257186968	0.21231179445848097	0.4683061398332579	0.4721616981540379	0.49845013502318325	0.5094677613990304	0.5211120138815233	0.5776277608820889	0.6313839387244646	0.7226578501915182	0.7728815794695348	1.0309475963900376	1.502466701079531	1.7100828003158879	
so... it's really sexist, and classist, and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie, like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change. well, he certainly changed his tune, and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit. what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the movie does not make her a hero, it makes the whole thing sad. and its sad that people think it makes her a hero. perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience. yuck.	-2.137943711704856	-1.8626570429138445	-1.2767900530465923	-1.0282377067735657	-0.8204584381927617	-0.7700369927190818	-0.5408597184216756	-0.2502628705076281	-0.045347705130109814	0.0641914578103657	0.06701997442666316	0.08630431175637393	0.10843252111293464	0.12353209152839384	0.1867288516859677	0.2718186518702322	0.2898422422552345	0.2984419861287487	0.3455416190008578	0.47960913427281815	0.764427983624897	0.956077423558227	1.0063579364879103	1.3430176592238936	2.9796757464570063	
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. Lets put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought 'I can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. The acting in this film was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place. The storyline was mediocre and I suppose, like most films, If the rest had been done well it would have stood up. I don't usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating (must be cast/crew) I felt I had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack.	-3.6111143799156564	-1.7452369651236361	-1.7259491003172427	-1.7130496057404607	-1.5755554282761899	-0.8620107955776078	-0.45169581046039486	-0.4274735835494717	-0.4102451869315619	-0.34445024129162044	-0.23056108388133398	-0.1860621052108406	-0.08239572993543942	-0.07402248690208486	-0.00946097470491819	0.17725301149534833	0.3368615447284131	0.3510636912439725	0.44002412616147984	0.4884847057947192	0.7083682669116107	0.7261130984812858	0.9227446838343727	1.9009515748109511	3.69513373689499	
The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. isn't a particularly good documentary. Aesthetically, it's lackluster and cheap looking, the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in-cohesive, but this adds to it's charm. I say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and, as such, there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits. There are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of Wood, and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary. Overall, it's worth a watch for the Wood fan and those of cinema in general, but don't expect brilliance here. Expect a documentary made after Wood's own heart.	-1.515265017244134	-1.0770804255705044	-0.6748615911937581	-0.5038723638623895	-0.4305024885246093	-0.35396493047059324	-0.12018079868356675	-0.10478725833144685	-0.10450586973912704	0.04312699247562322	0.06690265146264328	0.08604545759532058	0.09317217355464956	0.1639864135058717	0.21827303262798958	0.2599331896766147	0.3177677828790126	0.33309861829872967	0.3537094213663604	0.6849958941533866	0.8399714329450849	0.8853151235792676	1.2808909832216016	1.4598228704387517	1.4666256729501201	
This is really really bad. Lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job. But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric "I got the evidence on you!". (Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but i couldn't find it on iTunes). Talk about seeing into the future...Too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgettable. The score and songs are more interesting than the script. Ditto the sequel. Which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all. My understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these B movies. Doesn't say much for the world's viewing habits.	-3.6769497843560286	-2.120537245121562	-2.068637691977709	-1.829218709415098	-1.1777561753565737	-0.9472125892890559	-0.6345120938749811	-0.24213863746088687	-0.057635051635371956	-0.024798944251533367	-0.019783496955852346	-0.016178804693123577	0.011688297190112731	0.10895005618223336	0.12246718218834919	0.29974938233814946	0.36436202320449196	0.3983575897893963	0.6040497540309018	0.6080344573414447	0.7960126772054581	0.8839347735378261	1.4007335863660215	2.641956782455836	4.402298164973448	
This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. Well at least Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically awful bland CBC comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show.	-4.029327524352704	-2.2498170746707418	-1.9105121937699863	-1.7680751539312458	-1.636140691018313	-1.1717976724835315	-0.7124833611781254	-0.6864922682642915	-0.4855876112831093	-0.35443955340611855	-0.30353080922770154	-0.24084702600571323	-0.23876057720407146	-0.1613749030172822	-0.10311699322077056	-0.031411647364427295	-0.006745541705222707	0.16730497386859694	0.2801891403485883	0.4360832636520392	0.5848129480140334	0.6946981277971376	1.8756521882912558	1.8762676872034796	3.9646887811430553	
BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.<br /><br />This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT.<br /><br />With regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. It is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.<br /><br />Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed. The final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.<br /><br />The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family. It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.<br /><br />On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events.<br /><br />Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. And then some!<br /><br />First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. This factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this "ghost" does!<br /><br />Second, the direction. The direction is haphazard and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost.<br /><br />Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.<br /><br />Finally, the humour. The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!<br /><br />The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen.<br /><br />Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie. It is not even in the "so bad it's good" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free!<br /><br />I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.	-24.376042453336535	-13.487783557286182	-12.082116764320963	-9.566413337004306	-9.071054551759868	-8.806300159700491	-6.5510241501237445	-2.8485478369849657	-1.3422833741128362	-0.9229770013074654	-0.6367682041791459	-0.5983798945961404	-0.5882377759352976	-0.22751407101617935	2.6181621810650775	3.048473317118861	3.1622533917514866	3.4886063329271835	3.7119982699336274	3.766066604981813	5.4219244503110176	6.159135827780778	6.234963403752225	15.26907701213554	28.177455857552115	
A badly-acted two-character comedy-drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren't-we-awful-to-the-Indians polemic, with lousy special effects, exploitative use of nudity, and ugly violence. It's as sincere as a politician's handshake, as obvious as a car salesman's pitch, one of the worst movies in the history of the universe.

JP3 lacks the Spielberg touch. It's an all-out assault on the senses featuring "in your face" dinosaurs. Watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell. <br /><br />The script is lame; it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered. Also, we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth. For example, William H. Macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino-thugs for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially sympathetic in JP1; in this film, she's barely a blip on the radar screen.<br /><br />The whole JP3 experience was t o o m u c h.

This could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! I had this film when I was a theater manager. When I put the film together, and watched it, I thought I had some reels out of order. As it turned out I didn't, and if I did, nobody would have noticed. I couldn't figure out what's going on! Everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way!	-2.4437330570601783	-1.0441895202827478	-1.0246550558465055	-0.952738456684226	-0.7416039341404745	-0.6609021855638089	-0.632200782968452	-0.45445255018079084	-0.3299135141416603	-0.2050106013350544	-0.0937315519344063	-0.024652641213482474	0.10285288013003613	0.19068144608830817	0.19776171068235618	0.20696932351274955	0.2688808989219354	0.27692460852432776	0.2928354416723513	0.3317520503333798	0.39746085761989913	0.6193313042203201	0.9751885979312211	1.107762874082925	2.8361172780722366

I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. It debuted opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Then it did a nosedive. Critics HATED this film. I don't remember seeing one good review. Everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant back then but now I do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol. When I was younger, I didnt care for that. It was Hulkamania, brother!!!<br /><br />Now I find this pretty bad, but still fun to watch once in a while when its paired with Bodyslam (which has a better storyline). First off, Hulk Hogan's acting skills just aren't great. he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring. And actually, Rip and Hulk are not to far off from each other. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he is not good at playing the bad guy. He is better at comedy and nervous drama characters. He is just not believable as Brell. There isn't much character development in this film and the ones that suffer are the characters of Randy, Rip's brother and Charlie the trainer (In wrestling its unheard of a trainer escourting a wrestler to the ring lol). Tiny Lister plays Zeus the way its supposed to be played, so there isnt any problem there. Joan Severence is passable and for all you softcore hounds, she does have a lingerie scene lol. By the end, you figure, what's the point?<br /><br />For this one (as with other wrestling films or films that feature wrestlers as the main star), turn your brain off. You'll enjoy it more if you do.	-7.063399134538979	-4.201757874647483	-4.0756824143684005	-2.9852608943505103	-2.301702916666489	-1.88760938847228	-1.8752599826504044	-1.2250859764718303	-0.8503257978261252	-0.21434683667863888	0.011131132291764823	0.14771270954585308	0.16250837679239064	0.22271624393621098	0.5691914557752056	0.5961747498041245	1.1645503255674128	1.1728887350611512	1.1962415024437685	1.381025386962864	1.6828461376998158	1.8241760947339518	3.0509789763907875	4.6086497798530175	8.778013135687695	
The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show.<br /><br />Now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone -- and the whole thing revolves around the airline company. Even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill - way too over the top, where before it was perfect.<br /><br />That and no more Sarah Mason - one of the best looking girls in Hollywood.<br /><br />This is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show. You can almost see the meeting "the old man is funny, lets focus on him, make him way over the top and make it all about the airline.. it'll be a nutty version of the office!" Anyhow, no hot chicks, no watch.	-2.3132894609218297	-2.290577573045302	-1.490362532350691	-1.3696931056704917	-1.251358317707287	-0.8188713664128546	-0.3012994061173996	-0.26245352790302057	-0.08566214231907598	0.02221144484321594	0.05154946753045547	0.16406475956179484	0.2097467794999043	0.42999186942278167	0.4720617594495232	0.4762845961489559	0.48313160962327717	0.5826111851436183	0.6495641648471465	0.7575058535889563	0.8820995527438885	0.9140135691170435	2.2561578360217407	2.3429033874364937	2.4333183121732267	
"Ardh Satya" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belongs to the One man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.	-3.779364398371313	-3.705541749826063	-3.3409437501638455	-2.8431064487047903	-2.4334501628529726	-1.6610027441413355	-1.1823624585135062	-0.6507801346048575	-0.6198178114052074	-0.1684031969023886	-0.14549651626382562	-0.019815945712877085	0.21361904775290344	0.2801921978018695	0.3431225332797071	0.7339163743462636	1.1227902741268132	1.163579473584883	1.2528430472522947	1.7179201599178218	1.828373010297151	2.57719290359662	4.344117952574812	5.047157631721548	7.49896043597338

the only thing great about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a movie that's pure popcorn fun, but instead, I got that horrible Roy Liotta movie called " Turbulence" Yes, this is how bad SOAP is. The only thing make SOAP better is its title. And it's not even the apporiate title for the movie, the wasn't even a glimpse of "snake" or "plane" 40 minutes into the movie! What a false advertising! If it wasn't for its title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B-grade summer movie. And the R rating? It has to be the most undeserved R rated movie of all time! The makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a R, All of the violence are kept pg-13 level. You know what's really R rated? The R rated superstar Edge! See him at Summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake!	-5.506718832863297	-2.732280673293906	-2.585210868246652	-2.147483709393773	-1.9754324755431876	-1.906940779932974	-1.5167483176052836	-0.7568056617244192	-0.6699579653486815	-0.2933839041656027	-0.27587226091918204	-0.22497198756513898	-0.03672958848321939	0.05457916806956725	0.18996869623350857	0.4031532803526238	0.7394296398016471	0.7901017626639967	0.7997693083117973	0.8331378376578773	0.9399126720091973	1.5832404311090877	1.8465620745849867	3.2122578615973945	6.486525127427614	
This is the best work i have ever seen on television. The story is compelling--all the more so because it is true. The writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time). This was a BBC production and ran in the U.S. on American Playhouse. There is such an interest in seeing this--just hard to believe no one can make it available.	-4.393129731992483	-3.594658561619199	-1.815263846186584	-1.420135329617614	-1.2872827058251797	-0.6026492728988071	-0.29003298068298156	0.13745915810287274	0.16560304486822836	0.18089679162145744	0.45120993411995414	0.5818174093291244	0.6333729663746258	0.8993240054282257	0.9863253469686879	1.0822837235169172	1.100470263678034	1.3799075772121105	1.445260961240504	1.5222619533087514	1.5503716650727863	2.0853905016712804	2.1236944073989497	2.759412566158175	4.633254503329045	
It may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to Phoolan Devi herself and, when she did finally see parts of it, was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in India or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself. I do not know whether it was shown at all or not, but given her standing at the time as a rising politician, I doubt it. Since then, I saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her Dacoit days, and has gone into hiding as a result.<br /><br />Her own concerns aside, this is an excellent film, made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach; none of the rose-tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film. It should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the film's messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant: it's a true story. Her misgivings are, it seems, not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her.	-3.162849218027371	-1.4931309831909634	-1.4565429748756253	-1.4240550897703688	-1.1923260045857862	-1.0578260093076695	-0.9052046096292191	-0.444477332640899	-0.2095749989854978	-0.13427141725672595	-0.07900008149738126	-0.06527041811864842	0.008331657532714344	0.020824271957874757	0.05551575541950132	0.09361344190854083	0.13547595566325465	0.16054298632101224	0.20504465685974746	0.4421982559217875	0.48564634877232105	0.7735912521348436	1.2097927615645414	1.8948208356214418	3.646812858558278	
All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! It is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. A couple exchanging nods over their "good grub." A medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. Quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. Telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline). The sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there's talk of people burned in a fire. Lots of seemingly stock-footage close-up shots of animals, birds, insects, and spiders in the woods.<br /><br />The movie starts with a forest fire, then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe. The killer evidently wasn't too satisfied by the axe he stole, and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands.<br /><br />If it's true that the movie in the version available on the out-of-print videotape is cut, perhaps if there's a lot of footage that was cut, it deserves another look on DVD. Otherwise, it's simply not very interesting, and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors-slasher fan.	-6.0123288720918495	-2.745152945805947	-2.5103013685003	-2.2950579594852787	-2.1314923055033983	-1.5044152738540477	-1.0856099206079133	-0.6944959518915104	-0.6778293571540306	-0.5499088008655244	-0.5342113674891784	-0.07753527725459226	0.022731769310693095	0.10433168743920283	0.2671610072496714	0.3318122485898063	0.47573163576350375	0.6587725746298202	0.6706450601786894	0.7360955461067222	0.8502326687711289	0.9367054100468621	1.8155142583213442	2.7551063220259655	5.742496701228973	
This is an awful film. Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good. The plot having a cowboy get involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way. Well, okay it might be interesting, but its not, because its so badly paced and and only partly acted. I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen, probably more laughable then they do on TV. (I won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest. Never read about that in the old west) This is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward.<br /><br />I like schlock films but this is ridiculous. There is a reason that I don't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good, the plot taking a back seat to breasts. The original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats. The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent. The comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level, infantile but harmlessly fun. Something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie.<br /><br />The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film.<br /><br />I need not watch this again.<br /><br />Of interest to probably no one, the rapist and killer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped.<br /><br />Obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives.	-7.872765245010527	-3.897221453087755	-3.835048752205317	-3.677546016007929	-3.314647604356854	-1.9057030568223847	-1.6870585437407575	-0.7309668569693394	-0.4679117605701288	-0.462691853986358	-0.45098503644252785	-0.37750898581864356	-0.34281768684989666	0.437303351232536	0.47960333851561276	0.8495044432288151	0.8872402950939243	1.03369758459812	1.2856328667209114	1.3249939681445637	1.4901473163063317	1.6529390636811951	2.1636187909375955	4.623889961246888	9.161482139352604

I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about "Dinosaurs eat people." However, it was disappointing even on that level.<br /><br />For starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly "enough" dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are.<br /><br />(START SPOILERS) Then there were the Pterodactyls. The figures I've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the movie made them look closer to 300. Worse, they didn't get to eat anybody, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up. There was no ending to the movie, either, it was just, all of the sudden, credits. (END SPOILERS) I'm left wondering if the edition I saw was missing 40 minutes of film.<br /><br />My only conclusion can be that they taught the Pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your $7. Go rent the Carnosaur series; at least you won't be disappointed.	-7.184209817125203	-3.017514229794113	-2.9641306436024832	-2.694430427439283	-2.677608730273526	-1.5458429610413713	-1.4024693283002565	-0.7645089637032597	-0.7454467292870902	-0.5931526447622095	-0.4345808247595887	-0.37548628330556383	-0.1166402381510881	0.21907042508407157	0.34158799792445815	0.3557197483754907	0.3774976660459563	0.6773977826444728	0.9151511703743517	0.9302455322701744	0.9617916058223601	1.0585214208417977	2.4419264534063636	3.3189970847589354	7.384248148574453	
I was stunned by this film. I have been renting Antonioni's films/rediscovering them, and this film showed me the climax and fruits of his 50 years of directing. What an eye for setting, color, and detail! I have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. Yes, beauty moves me, like it moved Keats to write Ode on a Grecian Urn. This movie is made for the mature, emotionally and intellectually, audience. Those hoping to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to see this film several times before I can truly appreciate it and judge it. This film should be required viewing for all cinematographers and directors.<br /><br />Possibly a truly great film, on the order of Kurosawa's Dreams.	-3.9310660001237676	-3.23108505548575	-1.6999655351473435	-1.4205174087680246	-1.4075715463933887	-0.7534223814481922	-0.4409080955258809	-0.30267727954829454	-0.16372882602144187	-0.07960947248800027	0.21360012823737456	0.5692426775848036	0.585843365497585	0.6042545494613019	0.6298720764845348	1.0194976479186353	1.1551766500842215	1.1973001308589448	1.222812421965231	1.300790852446355	1.3290583595556102	1.4979067363153586	1.8939089371221862	2.5937758551946146	3.817204271455914	
A CRY IN THE DARK <br /><br />A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film. This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.<br /><br />Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level. If you ask me, this is an under-appreciatted classic.<br /><br />The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children.<br /><br />While the famous line "A Dingo Took My Baby!" has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.<br /><br />The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.<br /><br />The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping. As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlain's plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media. But at the same, the media/public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.<br /><br />The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.<br /><br />In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way. For me, this ranks as one of (if not #1) Meryl Streep's best performances. For all her mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I find this to be one of Streep's more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's finest work to date. It's a shame he wasn't recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep's... b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantly.<br /><br />More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams "The dingo took my baby!" watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line.<br /><br />...

Describing this film is a difficult task. On the one hand, it's an over-the-top vampire spookfest, complete with cobwebs, eerie music, a hypnotic medallion, and of course a coffin with a creaky lid.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is one of the silliest scripts this side of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people who gave us "The Bloody Vampire," "Invasion of the Vampires," and this film's predecessor, the modestly-titled "The Vampire," the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films.<br /><br />As I mentioned, this film is a sequel to "The Vampire," which I have not seen. But no matter...it's real easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is befuddled when the well-intentioned but misguided Dr. Marion brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy, Count Karol de Lavud (I suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be Counts of some sort). Dr. Marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies, and he hopes to use the vampire's corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire's lack of a normal reflection (at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the vampire's skeleton. ???).<br /><br />Enrique is not pleased, and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition. "This man was no vampire...I'll admit that he liked to drink a little blood, but that's all!" he states. Also confusing matters is the fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!) who happens to be Enrique's object of affection. Martha narrowly escaped de Lavud's clutches in the first film, and apparently Enrique has spent a great deal of time "healing her mind" and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not real.<br /><br />OK, so if you were the scriptwriter for this film, you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire, right? Well, how about the greedy con man who helped Marion steal the coffin? After getting a glimpse de Lavud's body, he sets his sights on the expensive-looking brooch that the Count is wearing, and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors aren't looking. But darn it...he can't remove the brooch because of the stake, so...you guessed it. De Lavud is on the loose again, this time with the shady con as his human henchman.<br /><br />OK, so of course the vampire is after Martha again, and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe. At first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an all-points bulletin out for "a man who is dead but still alive!".<br /><br />You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists. One of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum (is there any other kind in these types of films?), complete with a fully-equipped torture chamber...with REAL torture and execution equipment. The movie has a very keen sense of style, and not just in the campy cobwebs. One effectively creepy sequence has de Lavud chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways, following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a German expressionist nightmare ("The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" seems to be an influence).<br /><br />But the rest of the film is juvenile, particularly in the film's climax. The special effects are quite crude, even for the year that this was made, and the climactic fight with de Lavud in bat form is laughable enough...but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a guillotine, positioned so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade, which is in danger of falling because the restraining rope has suddenly begun to fray RIGHT AT THAT VERY MINUTE! What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he cuts away from the fraying rope to scenes of Enrique trying to dodge the swooping rubber bat, basically standing still and waving his arms around. It's definitely an Ed Wood moment if ever there was one, especially when Martha seems to revive on her own and rises groggily to her feet just as the blade slams down. Whew! What a relief! In terms of kookiness, "The Vampire's Coffin" does not have the lunacy factor of "The Bloody Vampire" or "Invasion of the Vampires", but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography, and the fact that the director manages to wring some real chills from this material has to "Count" for something (haw haw).	-12.801791692749754	-6.698849887125535	-6.4379335659482395	-5.044314839474158	-4.540490674137754	-4.320012991384139	-1.8792428371672403	-1.5180501021101647	-1.499390595782606	-1.403597967690417	-1.0424164864904277	-0.7517143497994468	0.00986532938195786	0.3664877522220884	0.7431201226437156	0.848273589821225	1.3070291631559043	1.5576066989125765	2.0798835935659694	2.085910078680394	2.3960252824152257	2.4099139045822704	2.7286915657002626	7.045267400668234	14.368013031571394

First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people. For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.<br /><br />The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. It captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they won't each other again.<br /><br />The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.<br /><br />See it and it may change your way of life.	-4.4341677933360755	-2.960283520900019	-2.002048439953623	-1.7357626760755205	-1.6025258970182101	-0.5099929950248463	-0.27447845144306765	-0.16930051230784132	0.012028496606723062	0.39179593132610946	0.6940358874245374	0.7568150711339643	0.8110441454278241	0.8565015121833934	1.1892227962208768	1.210554560652044	1.5095330092401957	1.6028800250048496	1.7446502794871457	1.7495328645692059	1.7879364694069264	1.7988524595227808	3.237738929839902	3.272692449862687	4.778461392623701	
As most other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of 'After The Funeral' is very good indeed. Always one of my favourite Poirot stories I was worried that it might be 'messed about with'. Well, it was a little bit but ONLY a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining. David Suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as Poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan who surely could not be bettered as Miss Gilchrist. I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott who was spot on as the cutting Rosamund Shane but really, the casting was quite impeccable throughout! <br /><br />One point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes. The business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although I didn't mind how they tightened up the structure of the Abernethie family (in the book the family tree IS really quite complicated). The final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and I found the very end, when they all leave Enderby, quite touching. This is really one of the very best of the Poirot series so far.	-2.755134696406103	-2.018477633106198	-1.6442755985575692	-1.39132645907332	-1.2224705285299844	-0.641163657902063	-0.2014036122898597	-0.051045078705720254	-0.016362275851845007	0.14982552940387073	0.33908542155851445	0.46939354460190275	0.6113637677435729	0.6606062302601416	0.6915682835034029	0.7124705176405417	0.8176341299406918	1.0098229287783593	1.237296119782883	1.2912083596861152	1.4267175066246824	1.8545081803013328	2.7226510081270643	3.3984242414142187	3.4246515546217546	
This movie had an interesting cast, it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job. Im glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot. I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation. This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future.	-0.9737944453673962	-0.8896259596643559	-0.8506090946261027	-0.7992282146881766	-0.6348133865511141	-0.4649131533633053	-0.37875763992905986	-0.1258718891754985	-0.054425542302896035	2.1438064023501097E-4	0.0106048485738863	0.1472878165413154	0.17857815134624347	0.19731434522884056	0.19930019305475935	0.21355619678114368	0.3097314296882196	0.34380910032399603	0.4404779405614109	0.46449056025599084	0.6988770961984881	0.7182645645203856	1.1994624339505136	1.4260387767542682	1.806079375852529	
A girl named Isobel becomes possessed by a demon. The local priest (who formerly dated Isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter.<br /><br />This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the writer of "House" and the writer/director of "House II". I loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. Alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students. Dawson Leery could have done better. I have thought about blaming new writer Ellary Eddy, especially because the idea is hardly original (are they trying to cash in on the fans of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose"?), but Wiley should have been able to do his magic.<br /><br />Also, you'd like to think veteran horror stars Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this film. Russo (playing the bishop) barely shows up, and Combs has a great role as a sheriff... for the five minutes he's on screen (but I love the mustache). So, no help here.<br /><br />After seeing "The Exorcist", all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default, no? And the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least. No head-spinning or paranormal activity at all. Just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup. All the "demonic" stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, "you get a lot of Isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. Yeah, it's Chuck E. Cheese gone wild." That sadly sums up the extent of the "evil" in this movie.<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off-camera, this is the movie for you. But, if you don't mind my saying so, you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you're seeking.<br /><br />The plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who didn't, but did sleep with his daughter) and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife (who might have, but denies it). And then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in God. What was all the Bible-quoting you were doing five minutes ago?<br /><br />A horrible exorcism movie. Horribler examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And such a sad display of directing after the "House" series of films became classic. I would like to pretend Wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal, uninspired film. The power of Christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin.	-12.18957948355008	-5.724273040054898	-4.5464734326584955	-4.032888257048624	-3.9962500326558943	-3.9000111000273345	-3.271587399172334	-1.4295062722116112	-0.9480432646089826	-0.8007441129386632	-0.36846782083442947	0.2157216021338499	0.30313184979572133	0.7225930486751952	0.8028169920862238	1.0425789244731618	1.4650572725106978	1.4704920368391516	1.5526581294098174	1.557240121341143	1.7792701926153334	2.7660205538739713	4.276112977758873	6.573410552593122	13.874315248930804	
I don't know who to blame, the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. This could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of timidity, even cowardice, that hung over each scene. Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world? If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old. What a waste, not just for the viewers but for the actors as well.	-4.994443345660686	-2.159290178365089	-2.1221986097963743	-1.8288591597600201	-1.7694717703380924	-1.6260575568568982	-1.3898630664770653	-0.8799448815116068	-0.35853238005607413	-0.18327496939510637	-0.08845344960069534	-0.017172464360480894	-0.0033672262609979464	0.05176783272914519	0.05498127780567444	0.2853342771795919	0.3349279993625427	0.37102849103059604	0.5180536696662824	0.5685061529469433	0.7916188441975397	0.798606538169076	2.4470439374478663	3.0445915519902655	5.493667447123031	
Boy-girl love affair/sequel with songs, only this time she's the punkette and he's the straight arrow. Movie-buffs out there actually like this movie? It has fans? I must say, the mind reels... "Grease 2" is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage, moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames (like "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, it whimpers along in slow-motion and often just plays dead. It looks and feels cheap, with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling. This was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and, although she doesn't embarrass herself, it's a role worth forgetting. A misfire on the lowest of levels.

I would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if Claudia Black had not continued on in it! Her inclusion as the silly 'Vela' has brought the series down in my estimation. To bring her in as a regular at the same time as including Ben Browder to replace RDA was a mistake.<br /><br />Unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of 'Jack' and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'Farscape'.<br /><br />I was a great fan of the film "Stargate" and when the series was first announced I had reservations that it could live up to the film, but after watching the first episode I have to admit I was hooked. I have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation	-1.4274180643572119	-1.1700040994263907	-0.9317961532495038	-0.721389134779053	-0.5204103600433162	-0.4317155267081264	-0.41686956720305923	-0.40907301793335743	-0.26581060453953487	-0.24841562454094035	-0.1969397974199109	-0.18732053506717183	-0.08039991365888509	0.0166603760322932	0.13892640810717952	0.16332427198274932	0.18748163059485307	0.4100710819271781	0.440673836075276	0.5126664245567641	0.5693025464931688	0.7259373602093222	1.0204695884794877	1.488986984822804	2.233005545221176	
I mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana... this could've been fun, if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing that I almost showed my teeth of, was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either Oklahoma or Kansas... The plot could have been fun, had it not been for abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this piece-of-crap movie, don't. How dumb is it, that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them he's gay, like his friend did (just that he wasn't pretending...) and there's that dumb hick joke about the several meanings to the word "gay".

I wish there was a category to place this in other than Horror. It simply isn't. Granted it has it's horrific moments, however I don't feel that makes it a horror film. I will give that this movie could have been better. A million little things could have been changed to make it better.<br /><br />That having been said I love this movie. I'm often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it. It has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say... things aren't always what they seem. Sometimes 'evil', isn't. <br /><br />Barker was at a Con I went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing. It was very interesting. Many things he wished to put in the movie couldn't be, and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost. This was a chunk that helped shed light on Boone and his Girlfriend, as well as some other details.<br /><br />I know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the 'breed' in the background, however I always felt that gave the movie a more 'real' fleshed out feel. I have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics. Because of this, the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story. A much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live. <br /><br />Despite all of the flaws this movie might have I believe it has a lot to offer. The 'monsters' are wonderful, very imaginative. While the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines. Whenever I watch it I find something new. Keep and eye on Boones chest toward the end. At one point Decker stabs him and shortly after Boone falls on a card table. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. This card stays there for a while even after Lori pulls the knife out. It stays there until Boone casually removes it. I love that. That was a lovely little detail I thought.<br /><br />Basically what I want to say is that... if you are looking for a horror movie, don't watch this. If you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up. This is the movie for you. This is a movie about how men destroy what they don't understand or fear.	-7.209260706647679	-5.8805088662650755	-5.3219181600828325	-4.079573221636931	-2.486469914908292	-2.416375164722295	-1.908914843523755	-0.6846443679707169	-0.5998020907407797	-0.43521928537674076	-0.3643271907950805	0.06923818464906636	0.14886386810041652	0.17970631078739344	0.4086461353270159	0.6771675467518321	1.2577068227574495	1.3901907037563987	1.403926556374975	2.308495597129116	2.4809084766964222	2.53557978351157	4.980844822534945	6.702364621755426	12.10500492774728	
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background. For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change. The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill. To go along with that scenery, any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, neither of which Houston has very much of. Even the hospital itself, on the outside, is very unbelievable. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the United States and sits smack dab in the middle of the Medical District just miles from downtown Houston, yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the countryside.<br /><br />It is obvious that whoever was in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous shots of radar are all wrong. The first radar image in the movie is that of Hurrican Hugo hitting South Carolina. We later see Kris Kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is moving back south across Houston yet the radar image he shows has Alison clearly moving north off of the Gulf of Mexico into Houston...probably the initial landfall of Alison.<br /><br />As for the acting, it isn't all that bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a straight-to-TV movie. The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining. My one problem with the acting is the portrayal of Houstonians with big thick Southern accents...the actors all sound like they are from Birmingham, Alabama and not Houston, Texas.<br /><br />The movie gets its point across and to the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to: entertain. If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June of 2001 then you will be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on Houston metro itself. If you are looking for a factual account of Tropical Storm Alison's impact on Houston metro might I suggest watching The Weather Channel's Storm Stories for Tropical Storm Alison.<br /><br />*1/2 out of *****	-7.434370684022063	-3.7495449749433334	-3.573456247306746	-2.5851380255140737	-2.561812108518023	-2.1494453681245282	-2.061451493916545	-0.5409977954034115	-0.5219780621215651	-0.5196745823412343	-0.15678777443570574	-0.06358711437057449	0.22176308823244678	0.4315746561988224	0.47190783687325194	0.8311970125795919	1.1437037810920847	1.1898068331306966	1.3637337764607818	1.7701533649706653	1.918715452144682	2.007752975742673	2.6801757166124505	4.601919026314347	9.598871829703283	
Here it is.. the first EVER episode of Friends, Where we get introduced to Control Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), Newly divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actor and ladies man (Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). This is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend Spoilt kid Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston).<br /><br />The Episode is better than most people give credit for, like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic. The acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters (apart from Kudrow and Perry- who shine).<br /><br />Matt Le Blanc- Man, his acting was down right dreadful because until later, he gets more confident, but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails.<br /><br />David Schimmer- Why does he over pronounce EVERY word? he cannot speak normally! but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he isn't confident. and i cannot sympathise with him Jennifer Aniston- Looks hot, and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the 1st season, Courtney Cox- Looks quite anorexic in this episode, its worrying, she looks totally different now, (more healthily), she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry- I'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb, and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing himself basically! The episode quality does improve later,,, such as the Sets, they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly, the acting is OK, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot! I hope we see the Friends reunite! cause they will always be there for us!	-4.481009643104195	-2.678588121633131	-2.5269205241133195	-1.9020963261922867	-1.8950631069640302	-1.6153615600742262	-0.7324416032776262	-0.4895982905271982	-0.38087473147745887	-0.3062693079413443	-0.285758613629818	-0.12394869462162864	-0.020796234023079757	0.01631239402659039	0.2560619043842669	0.29658456681333	0.4601844346061429	0.4743517764325685	0.8298228939280439	0.8447910906885975	0.846555094098286	0.971763870321458	0.9877043875571161	2.9827999736649957	4.89661954506303	
I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09.<br /><br />Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of countless movies I've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I've ever wanted to walk out early from.<br /><br />The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of "provocative" concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama. The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views. That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic. If there ever was a time when Towelhead's white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's long past.<br /><br />For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.<br /><br />On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled. As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites, you'll frequently come across superlatives: "stunning," "breathtaking," "profound," "shocking," ... It embarrasses me to read them, but it does not surprise me. Indeed, I've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight. If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass on this one.	-4.57383770373378	-3.260474616508378	-3.0420410071577684	-2.667423854859385	-2.1992702051888835	-1.6457781002507124	-1.0659957452346973	-0.565827438204623	-0.4740301383474674	-0.47105138919960965	-0.32854791328338273	-0.07393613775292623	0.03232059544159597	0.39884758406778764	0.5987830323887587	0.6183273475364196	0.6882348906342405	0.8534244282814888	1.02082790639123	1.0930892252097422	1.2707725897376483	1.7885621749449316	2.8737730032403777	3.7695132980601227	7.010666859393936	
This is slightly less sickening than the first two films, but otherwise it's business as usual: a scuzzy, sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema. Charles Bronson is back, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. Crime, you see, is up 11% in the South Belmont area... so what's to be done? A stronger police presence? Tougher jails? Harsher sentences? Nope, the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like Bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge  or, as the writers would have it, justice: this time he's the personal killing machine of police chief Ed Lauter.<br /><br />The writers bend over backwards to make Kersey the hero, sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection, and supplying a scene in which Kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back, to applause from the watching crowd. Capital punishment for theft? Well, okay. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer Kersey on or back him up is appalling.<br /><br />Sure, these villains are scum, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make up its mind, rather than slanting the entire thing towards Kersey and his mindless answer? Funnily enough the beleaguered residents don't fear gang reprisals or blame Kersey for any of the violence, which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre, never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being.<br /><br />The atrociously shallow performances don't help  Bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can't even put inflection on the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here  a machine gun? A rocket launcher?!  and new lows of misogyny: the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight, whether by rape, explosion or throat-slashing; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion, like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden, gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is dreck, pure and simple, mindless garbage put together without style or sense.	-9.308305825201039	-4.509692145987715	-4.250079887335716	-3.675713075566168	-3.513057648072903	-2.2846832912066373	-1.1325528477102944	-0.9092968308886373	-0.8178897704679008	-0.7979514492121276	-0.45161486475108237	-0.31408235680727487	-0.25349962491767647	0.2366333348444832	0.2515023025769375	0.27606154273081646	0.7902323867561998	0.83241655980196	0.9865746531685093	1.2347505396944134	1.3324343391164475	1.3913118777195548	3.3684876950508857	4.863264348491196	9.112343394456468	
Even though the story is light, the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie.<br /><br />The film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspect of attraction between man and/or woman and how it frequently is ethereal. Their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto, it will flow out like a handful of sand.<br /><br />I thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was, the more the man desires her. It parallels her deep love for god, who is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart.<br /><br />A very good movie. 7/10	-2.2751168427583024	-0.9127168875279825	-0.7912899782653965	-0.4751728659633771	-0.44259487714795803	-0.2752346267778299	-0.26863126629622003	-0.23890716751774516	-0.12530944961496637	-0.09769049831574195	0.09850666719529165	0.24968520968454236	0.3622114897074404	0.44634112645162316	0.5268710830134916	0.597661607323987	0.6007535393209429	0.7781247613862825	1.0041809266432775	1.0650610169241315	1.1094690170035197	1.1158616732062923	1.4797600994937496	1.7137726554842108	2.1954590178150055	
I'm pretty sure Poe would have considered this a travesty. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What on earth was Fellini thinking? It's a rambling, random, dull piece, with little to recommend it. One should feel frustrated at the lack of backstory or conclusion, but there's only relief that it's over.	-2.155389113632184	-1.7992271800814286	-1.1857124306941809	-1.1765367134728921	-0.7523491704017531	-0.7064705860276577	-0.6286675331254713	-0.2359863915612869	-0.09216038952265763	-0.05816212363574921	0.0058081017765803655	0.01293027159683428	0.03709811873634779	0.11896099076768472	0.16827365935190342	0.2591820453823743	0.2746661866798248	0.2858325540826133	0.4811168748907843	0.4996721710526427	0.5261754185156391	0.5438323617663607	0.9522967341238008	1.787233462805507	3.075559653284998	
Its spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs. That was pretty tight. Before and after that the movie pretty much blows. The acting is like E-list and it's shown well in the movie. Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film. The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Other than that if you see this movie at Blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated.	-2.9212538059451565	-2.0013944122104617	-1.6109397575963789	-1.1479261961326377	-1.0262436206288883	-0.6608783737956444	-0.5901779705098159	-0.45520868701533124	-0.39883337993972134	-0.02226165038143823	0.07696004196766491	0.1824528355706337	0.19733296035317321	0.19734005679521996	0.2941358230295649	0.32034237134288823	0.34686209015990294	0.43555916720180116	0.5247531497638289	0.5738003052271644	0.8091505459638579	0.873344148646515	1.4319903587238016	1.6643158014607202	3.4636934851524566	
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? There's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period! I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!<br /><br />1	-4.134085384570753	-1.820601010980808	-1.768169207770946	-1.6836682898583557	-1.6167258471276758	-1.5852620497438452	-0.7716180872443855	-0.6859586726068836	-0.6171824297325459	-0.3130151684404135	-0.25138090170518473	-0.15957350943444623	-0.1497847651533216	-0.08225906770028156	0.11592292562581594	0.1729522148348973	0.363675458455025	0.4839954188167122	0.49797114130598863	0.6095637842128924	0.9352480096949409	1.06347945783524	1.6138786040769248	2.3172114168515274	4.46559488839598	
I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. <br /><br />As for those that think that this film is "overrated" or "over-hyped"...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film "HUGE" or a "HIT" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! <br /><br />Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was "overhyped"...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being "overhyped". ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! <br /><br />Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!<br /><br />	-4.948451442860182	-4.525854006824086	-4.423193163765436	-4.258308716158913	-2.069519125262518	-2.0524984163482536	-1.255247695234497	-1.2364448216645971	-0.7031667503490615	-0.6816239555861144	-0.3169294617074212	-0.1467124864692445	0.05476463857932688	0.23592811787614137	0.505310294518959	0.7102023221317554	0.7324375648340359	0.898342417578898	1.8221706652222553	2.045265153615078	2.2670755725566325	3.009790861977306	4.721966101856164	5.543637807499941	9.833517749690222	
Don't ask me why I love this movie so much...Maybe it came at a time in my life I desperately wanted to fit in, maybe it is the amazing monster effects, maybe because I enjoyed the novel "Cabal", but It's probably because I LOVE Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a WTF moment at the end. At least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons. The studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a HORRIBLE job promoting it. The adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the "Button face/Mask" Decker character. This is a movie about the monsters! About fantasy! About a place called Midian! It's a story where the monsters are the good guys. There is truly nothing else out there like it! It's not a movie for everybody I suppose but it stands as one of Clive's many great works. Sit back and be prepared to be taken to Midian - where the monsters are.	-2.596214670130686	-2.1915486401092403	-2.1682429939701806	-1.7414036344827566	-0.9176604380041277	-0.6207935164718132	-0.4606145395758731	-0.40558675126732696	-0.38941603880447806	-0.13497160088160606	-0.11908676269527495	-0.11840071734398908	-0.08576880318331453	-0.04845507720891607	-0.04142391829245757	-0.016329309884065106	0.10991852072197479	0.24449874586706263	0.7347081915909991	0.8095163146356261	0.95594841518085	1.4652938809497305	1.6418435032360097	2.117422750670176	3.3730940384038464	
This film revolves around an Arabian leader (Amir) who dies and wants to live on. So a Dr. Lloyd Trenton is being paid to transplant Amirs brain into a "willing" participant. But in the Doctors basement his dwarf assistant Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drains young girls blood for the doctors purposes. So meanwhile Doctor Llyod pays a man to kill the people who assisted Amir into the country (Which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams, and various unknown bodyguards.). Grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road. While this has happened the doctors other assistant Gor is sent out to get a body for amir and hurts him so badly Dr.Llyod cant operate. Meanwhile, Grant finds Amirs "girlfriend" Regina Carrol and tells her his story. Grant sees the man who drove him off the road and Dorro kills him. Then since Gor failed to get a body D.r Llyod puts Amirs brain into Gors disfigured body. Then Grant and Regina go to the Doctors lab an<br /><br />------------------------SPOILERS------------------------- find out his secret. Soon Amir (Gor) are prancing around killing people and in the muddle of what I think is plot Dr.Llyod has a brain-ray gun which hurts Amir on command. It turns out Dr.Lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without law. So then Regina dies. and at the end Amirs new body (I think) say that it shall be a new country blah blah.<br /><br />I still don't get the ending but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of smelly cheese.This film features Grant Williams in his second to last film roll. I recommend it for any fan of Al Adamson or if you like Brains.	-6.348066159883339	-3.246629909586466	-2.2592067367660684	-1.875535435728749	-1.7998967857410084	-1.3022176381700215	-1.282743917049939	-0.098632676018479	-0.029905391310514683	-0.0058881826478748844	-0.005491992780500721	0.14563487791935867	0.3007363006027952	0.3225194240440769	0.3523723552109088	0.410500360638528	0.46290783705920735	0.5301154033874936	0.5587073525545434	0.6688313095546322	0.8263283751821122	1.632560751504611	2.721994130604251	2.767224942473819	7.302057938286961	
So, Madonna isn't Meryl Streep. Still, this is one of her first films and a comedy at that. Give her a break! Sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w/ Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, though(a piece of fluff), it's quite a bit of fun to watch. I've yet to hear anyone that slams Madonna's acting skills back it up w/ evidence or even adjectives other than "awful", "bad", or other such vague descriptive words. If you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston?? She's had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn't act her way out of a hatbox. The American public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her movies. Get real people. Madonna-bashing is so 90's.	-3.64027037310673	-3.6391080403311524	-2.337191793104633	-2.180656382841874	-1.3816230035141193	-1.1698360309815912	-0.7535789549291808	-0.505191911558121	-0.4108565861906898	-0.22454098127781136	-0.18027576204465545	-0.06983841562059542	0.02115272042468174	0.32945541327234923	0.3339813714620722	0.47135305560601753	0.49026514061817666	0.6496060408398987	0.6630501092325786	0.7529559778065381	0.9243936172952144	1.0015603729920959	1.9842377916127885	2.654778002076335	4.797984486361196	
Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two strangers on a European train. The two come from widely different backgrounds, he's American and she's French, after they talk a bit on the train Jesse manages to get Celine to get off the train and explore Vienna with him. During the next several hours the two wander Vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other. But will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.<br /><br />This wonderful romantic-comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" never bores because of its' small cast. In fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. Smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans.	-2.190483120899855	-1.531277961345123	-1.3575429007304318	-0.9493769141910088	-0.5711989804412323	-0.34963541964640144	-0.230876624991328	-0.12442270201577577	0.06747646038637037	0.10789901615353759	0.2117387381412355	0.3481617630841305	0.3996416497389058	0.4098377600466968	0.443823020123741	0.480932625324996	0.5823861412221834	0.6132309004859261	0.802584571084705	0.8712312933014327	1.009488369302449	1.131514252037714	1.665348646240478	1.9038890758210567	2.3469793036440825	
Despite its New York setting & New York characters, 'Summer in the City' is not an American movie, it is better than that. What is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres. Director Niami's shows a deft touch in combining comedy with tragedy, pathos with drama.<br /><br />The secret of Niami's success appears to be a smorgasboard of great characters - each could have their own film built around them - and then filling them out with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderfully eclectic casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie, ranging from Bai Ling to Ornella Muti, Robert Burke to Peter Stormare who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in Hollywood pictures. Even Sandra Bernhard is funny here !<br /><br />An added bonus, cream on the substantial cake, is John Cale's soundtrack.	-1.9197439497007946	-1.3336829510637709	-0.8083616528836872	-0.7899118628906455	-0.7879729687525523	-0.42419917519740924	-0.24296997079241153	-0.1988562937979355	-0.05771288307976036	-0.053161789502142405	-0.04855818772542149	0.018672664554559598	0.04839874599313712	0.052400003737935075	0.1138979697791824	0.1672607019861196	0.1760826608891093	0.2085575154213272	0.22314395535161355	0.30146543460320596	0.6011052134905056	0.8677759253861325	0.8790144616520316	1.5590429695966102	1.6626457715372929	
All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the film. Her tom-boy look does not really goes well. Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all. Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but its not at all Quetin. The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not. Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is Saif. The Style and the Phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed	-5.3487702549302405	-2.342027232033157	-2.1584039082639093	-2.12502663835352	-2.0468440040979803	-1.6581842642301545	-1.2000348216575702	-0.500793210532586	-0.4619309471674312	-0.37693359017424055	-0.2704100418797645	-0.04158492967464629	0.013595988422797071	0.2776567101270848	0.29273299427559063	0.3093798296807285	0.37989595213157096	0.537167643446708	0.5710438558565725	0.5792265904584065	0.7317771256737634	1.1223494484603995	2.206607315316302	2.628115384352174	5.8264593174865915	
i couldn't help but think of behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon (a massively more amazing film) when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea. this could have been a GREAT film. the acting is...from some of the actors alright. from others...it's downright horrible.<br /><br />that aside the idea is great and the format is great. the story is pretty good as well, though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind.<br /><br />nevermind that though right? it IS a horror movie after all.<br /><br />i really want to see this remade...i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be.<br /><br />however (and you can't really fault the minds behind the movie for this) this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget. and the fx really hurt the film overall.<br /><br />great movie. ...if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx.<br /><br />whoever wrote it should keep going though, great idea here.	-2.396254306102795	-2.056574519007576	-1.6088509069416854	-1.5785046107557015	-1.0095610674656852	-0.6491189344818993	-0.29490169819991374	-0.16401531891837481	-0.14433642107966035	-0.13558850297727953	-0.011843778945953932	0.039855479895834385	0.1401512544661151	0.5775773019017432	0.5811669913728772	0.6465778248931086	0.7640354208737449	0.8169759937881576	0.8485200249135466	0.8727047952595988	1.2303468688821275	1.681254297702102	3.0843311580380943	3.200359866786565	4.846444946158863	
i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll, despite the fact that there are, really, just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy, who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space, and makes you think, however jaded you may be, that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.	-3.69039076845863	-3.032751026145676	-1.6043256654638072	-1.187087259006207	-1.119141946236633	-0.2891964073222406	-0.24264141061708766	0.006641936793083796	0.1493519723111182	0.171460664734575	0.5920425643006555	0.6220637687521738	0.6792023020852984	0.7695873039459548	0.841721240006785	0.9615235141471798	0.9730734073804725	0.9889932273788973	1.1889311343030389	1.2868324328447722	1.5111785468982475	2.1303020749669965	2.2079161379997903	2.223449691767822	3.6381256792755643	
Being a long-time fan of Japanese film, I expected more than this. I can't really be bothered to write to much, as this movie is just so poor. The story might be the cutest romantic little something ever, pity I couldn't stand the awful acting, the mess they called pacing, and the standard "quirky" Japanese story. If you've noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too "different", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie. Seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.<br /><br />Fans of "Beat" Takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.<br /><br />2/10	-4.412189341051553	-2.230189418226369	-2.1979938627385716	-1.8665094854079536	-1.760881964088394	-1.3932037701372728	-1.1787120485536131	-0.5492192425570727	-0.34196086780910206	-0.2733971797315452	-0.22965686637538926	-0.2004380943013425	-0.14037976583887585	0.10065407958956225	0.214566538649282	0.2578500514240658	0.30465278943794916	0.35095709950826987	0.4383454223151255	0.5415276464832196	0.5565121951284445	0.7710087649449655	1.580337169065992	2.508231470263222	4.50305572803999	
When I first saw this film it was not an impressive one. Now that I have seen it again with some friends on DVD ( they had not viewed it on the silver screen ), my opinion remains the same.

Since "Rugrats"' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years, obviously the tyrants at Klasky-Csupo should be out of ideas. After dumbing down all of the characters, adding even stupider new ones, replacing some voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!), and having no sense of continuity (ex.: in a Kimi episode I watched the other day, Tommy and Chucky each got a new puppy; but it subsequent episode, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy. But noooo.<br /><br />All I will say concerning this special is that it sucks! While not as horrible as the Kimi episodes, everyone is even stupider than they were, including Grandpa (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now, he has no real purpose). The ending is needlessly fluffy, and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ('98-'01) is that the kids can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun!<br /><br />No stars at all for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please DESTROY this show before it gets any worse.	-4.874645309560278	-2.848359841708015	-2.6680476770191155	-2.609949751365169	-1.968726864501087	-0.8430012590979318	-0.6612198409952038	-0.6260264045283112	-0.4618855627409897	-0.361346894448824	-0.30501221292935476	-0.23326146029997064	-0.00255620175352176	0.028923168297961693	0.10773156370453485	0.3240938737429881	0.41159097218558605	0.5192759115699237	0.746472285955009	0.8823950359496812	0.9368856699552153	1.0430164984707746	1.5717757873000224	3.2574679716125163	5.556363426723302	
SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifters. But who is conning who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey? This gritty, dark movie is slow moving and seductive. It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path, only to waylay you just as you think you are safe.<br /><br />It has a riveting script, with good acting (at least from the leads). I didn't notice the background music, but it was never jarring, so it must have been done right.<br /><br />I was very surprised that I liked this movie, because I don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end.	-1.821134725024805	-1.2038231504811328	-1.0857793218433347	-0.9527613788874545	-0.7114042622998813	-0.5289290276507742	-0.4010563008122866	-0.29169003279955014	0.015588032519580339	0.04039406357583533	0.0443499755849206	0.0633157435865481	0.09268872873385899	0.2807297543464736	0.30744845881592603	0.43665728013979843	0.4723598866510855	0.4766873277464384	0.4829799556319589	0.6127855718414164	0.6657948415819972	0.8954425252098159	1.3894425842886975	1.4327248330671771	3.3021069923281585	
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face/ keep from being fired by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one that I highly recommend to classic movie lovers!!!!	-1.3362161143705071	-1.1122686771189492	-0.9280895694965234	-0.6147571582390888	-0.5355368875827528	-0.45784725952494465	-0.395430005264866	-0.18992143779061169	-0.02505087673123496	0.01774996839215226	0.021701129509005268	0.2270481349267211	0.2584175440322978	0.2637957976643376	0.3118120655797677	0.318458104735587	0.3269583903955062	0.376350967737813	0.4164395955728755	0.4241110995264839	0.5025346269793838	0.5180044081882841	1.239589620178074	1.346500861359405	2.7345231425938428

Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy ? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.<br /><br />It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die. The more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining.<br /><br />I do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /><br />6/10 come on Yankies get your English up to par !	-1.4657847425450365	-1.354002993741049	-1.1930652521726182	-0.6077132704950486	-0.606759763762049	-0.45128253438026894	-0.3605737010975167	-0.2743442207601827	-0.22946848719158372	-0.19444073307207035	-0.0646003004157804	-0.049291734485171226	-0.04013755112963064	-0.032320909688309724	0.0025314287891354745	0.18102774524405515	0.47219208957801295	0.4940232019747791	0.5856839647021382	0.6737530828585699	0.6797458167647277	0.7897375371678663	1.1558981891758222	1.5001818025728333	2.400917206695355	
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr. ). Alan has been trained to kill by former NYPD cop Sam (Woody Strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. Strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. As for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including Ten Little Indians, The Most Dangerous Game, and Escape From New York. The Final Executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans.	-1.7587985167949716	-1.7135967798620522	-1.2868734249485254	-0.9062096496597437	-0.7597890316206961	-0.6069989418307086	-0.5288961556592072	-0.332686219305791	-0.27572075544193925	-0.11350376011930519	-0.008191077714297598	0.06727848897364835	0.08147138065039447	0.10835520304507329	0.1592934508071942	0.21154852668032595	0.2637463939065454	0.3773843866370824	0.4672222029976487	0.468942932318301	0.5282255081154695	0.599362625283159	1.1510812708631444	1.3895466472196636	2.8351106432560083	
This movie is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) who star in this must have been really desperate for a job, or we're just friends. Here's the scoop:<br /><br />Three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman, they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her, they burn her, kick her, spin here around in a chair (over 200 times!), they use sound torture (by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It don't sound that bad at all, but it CAN make you go nuts). They throw guts (probably from an animal) at her while shes knocked out, and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget the grande finale the GREATEST EYEBALL TORTURE I HAVE EVER SEEN!<br /><br />If you have not heard of these films, and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film, you will think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick! Like I said pure underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror, or foreign gore. If your not I highly recommend you read-up on the series before watching! From the gore, shock, and creativity aspect it gets a 10, but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1. An underground classic...<br /><br />My final rating is a 8/10<br /><br />	-6.063591920451919	-3.064425040837628	-2.9278216424772556	-2.2123015952465237	-2.1321011960485694	-2.1094295563008685	-1.784329128670391	-1.0352956934696733	-0.3962069526475468	-0.2709417986490139	0.16598169798095788	0.19758801718426755	0.22400300368664444	0.23550934623998465	0.2846806013222354	0.29218839275085584	0.5982621829240322	0.6088006606977161	0.6143356656176931	0.7417713835462126	1.2197662987016622	1.341344124314903	1.770387924737904	2.7592223240283125	6.650305321242602	
As a kid, I loved this game. I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.<br /><br />You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X, but never mind.<br /><br />Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes. <br /><br />As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.<br /><br />Great tunes.<br /><br />Easy to get into and hard to put down.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2.<br /><br />Poor enemy AI. Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.<br /><br />Lack of combo moves.<br /><br />Lack of decent weapons.<br /><br />Bad guy models are repeated far too often.<br /><br />Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Lasting Appeal B-	-5.758997255112483	-4.9448671364709815	-3.6082381085356947	-2.4758958213228452	-2.093733666780608	-1.9873811552219827	-1.2014901252267456	-0.9017248552580399	-0.8132600631209365	-0.6414293135135184	-0.5000135357365596	-0.4838963434079824	-0.37238569436231045	0.011407315444583996	0.25812724797770714	0.2841371702629716	1.2253004008511341	1.8085569071599958	1.8289589124921093	2.033374729058839	2.243054338377138	2.3313319074971046	3.799000331187604	5.6488675445916545	9.849338094696025	
I'd love to see some tie-in between NightBreed, The Fury, and the X-Men Series, sort of the way the second Outer Limit's Series would tie-in particular stories and plot-lines after the fact, to create a Story Arc although one was never intended. I'd also like know if some more information - anecdotal or otherwise, exists anywhere about the relationship and/or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I simply can't get my mind around the fact that David Cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a Clive Barker film. Does any additional information on the subject actually exist? Finally, it's been 17 years since the film was released, and I had hoped there would've been a sequel by now. Does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition, or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel?	-3.052219716204892	-1.4368954076347964	-1.2480068582113655	-1.0047608901621647	-0.911661011683556	-0.6297302723352934	-0.6169908875634481	-0.6021262540466562	-0.2151981680816352	-0.16583606268778905	-0.07895490276141537	-0.07114384338875064	-0.02304760516153735	0.11304451493605137	0.18179195899836703	0.19153305019486505	0.21321886204970733	0.21896102246604932	0.2417836230294501	0.46399237293947254	0.49484451938139784	0.5568980147695834	1.3763945039323948	1.4813015093057718	3.479737066536816	
Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best. I left wondering why i spent my money on this movie.	-2.6261375353183327	-1.2221947359683012	-1.155718729863116	-1.149498852474023	-1.0569853509989608	-0.9746328621296323	-0.8607901791983386	-0.4832909064160771	-0.25479489927991844	-0.15993255768704823	-0.1282835859698504	-0.1078829766598162	-0.050954669733295085	0.06862242843803879	0.08478884066659842	0.10025150766534363	0.16979299560633762	0.17978537807192915	0.23597746916828893	0.41899732638341314	0.4529718261186023	0.9122480297314574	0.9435685415253607	1.4707586444004297	2.9285541013185377	
There are a whole lot of movies, primarily from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time. It is the prime example of how in the 80s, ANY movie could get released.<br /><br />Our killers name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is an escaped psychopathic killer running around in doctor's scrubs and a doctor's jacket hacking off people with a scalpel as he goes along. He ends up coming across a house of girls that are having a slumber party. One of the girls is the daughter of the doctor that tried to operate on Randle's, and Randle's ended up pulling him down in some kind of sexual position. (lol just watch the movie to know what I am talking about.) Now I know what you must be thinking at this point: This must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like Slumber Party Massacre, or Valentine's Day Massacre, right? NO! This movie is HORRIBLE! First off, the quality of the film changes off and on throughout the film. Sometimes it will look like it could have been filmed this year, but other times it is so grainy and blurry that it isn't even watchable. The funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they did not care at all.<br /><br />The director played the killer (as if that wasn't funny enough) but because of the fact that he wasn't talented enough to act and direct at the same time, he just filmed one shot of him walking toward the camera with his scalpel, and then just replayed that clip over and over every time someone is killed.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikable, and these people who are suppose to be ages 16-18 look more like they are 25-45. I know that slasher films commonly use adults as teenagers, but I have never seen a movie where it was THIS obvious. My guess is that the reason none of them are still in the film industry today is because they have all died of old age... Or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and that is a good thing because I highly doubt that they could have gotten into any more movies even if they tried. All I can do is hope that Tyler will one day make THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY 2: THE FINAL CONFLICT and have all of the original actors return. I'm sure everyone would love that.<br /><br />The movie was directed by Stephen Tyler, (No, not the singer) who never went on to direct again, and it was released by B&S (which I am sure stands for bull and ****) Productions. Bull&S only released one more film, "Forever Evil," which was pretty awful, but not near as bad as Last Slumber Party.<br /><br />A horrible, horrible, horrible film... Highly recommended.	-9.462120865206787	-5.54400532328029	-4.840643110140766	-4.157896764242979	-3.9143167478980967	-2.0561704847211755	-1.742292171289895	-1.4544184012628498	-1.152272333902938	-0.9066300689603793	-0.8860382226607653	-0.672224559818793	-0.38802029672539684	-0.24640183217989692	-0.05106176569501199	0.26971779152389624	0.4962941761325852	0.8703234359954655	1.069087883284668	2.0281695843037153	2.3107087974114995	3.0219561766789083	3.42316273713369	6.396403269090207	10.73956518528261	
I think the film makes a subtile reference to rouge of Kieslowski, as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red. It seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red, think of the tea-room f.e. I also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years.	-0.5425077526707921	-0.45328498800323624	-0.3668664394451134	-0.2489501100178004	-0.2093761321952532	-0.193926146839631	-0.07949166523068688	-0.07070946070055444	-0.030667698640630424	-0.01803064423197065	-0.011218300834952432	1.5245035188320155E-4	0.04938299190129471	0.06127243673139755	0.06465779571568595	0.0757611608104978	0.08297188949599812	0.08932611920215731	0.13995655739317728	0.16614948908927032	0.20728632826677557	0.20767697880206565	0.44531591925306824	0.4986583467903196	1.0017679923538148	
**Spoilers contained**<br /><br />I'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific. What I didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go. What starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about Honus (Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason. They then escape and both turn up (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the ending. After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/won't they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending. I didn't hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.	-6.39200571314764	-2.337230807904814	-2.179070653412915	-2.154337631285863	-2.1473306167018804	-1.9937911138275668	-1.7594343157052794	-1.3870294988688334	-0.9048624206484581	-0.6886932225979487	-0.29655411707935747	-0.07702358681489153	0.05217138856764396	0.07792901339611404	0.4056831091452147	0.5505682674908369	0.6219465333389028	0.6976253707622431	0.7572451720061222	0.7722857324803934	0.8311551167310022	0.9669081388136135	2.4750303340600524	2.5447688079233446	6.338786768813275	
This movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.<br /><br />We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story.<br /><br />Oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.<br /><br />Does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes. There's no connection to the killers.<br /><br />The killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and the two FBI agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty.<br /><br />We get it...surveillance...Oh, the Killers are voyeurs. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE, because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths. And the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes.<br /><br />All of this makes the ending even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a bunch of FBI agents in the beginning...what FBI agents sleep together? All in the same room. To be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being FBI agents? A cop 3 feet away apparently can't hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe.<br /><br />The other thing is the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere...	-9.757431319105114	-4.6358167371692645	-3.8827866224989562	-3.5289452852082817	-3.4122453447046537	-3.336370527723289	-2.919393569083657	-0.997424556850285	-0.7947548703275942	-0.696969086840668	-0.5457923471579385	0.1084512978270968	0.22831772716323767	0.5964020369625029	0.9075786529096579	0.9313779398045109	1.0543671036007247	1.2485570551757488	1.2826544968081857	1.444236079031074	1.5977279581713302	1.6054239700785962	3.5524613615393563	5.743897148747726	11.449584184722008	
I was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip. Although it started out slowly, I found that the realism in depicting the ship, the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change on this voyage and I wanted to be there for it. I was not disappointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in-between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a wealth of emotional overlaying, interaction and expression--relentless and compelling to observe. The movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes, making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next.<br /><br />Edmund Talbot is a complex character, the likes of which we don't see often. We may know where the captain stands or Mr. Prettiman, but they are older men, set in their ways. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, testing himself and being tested. He struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched, that grew with each hard-taught experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; it's too rare in movies and television.	-2.8176728876675776	-2.0425797326774062	-1.9725555571923712	-1.7257080662540634	-1.28938190993901	-0.6648742089194991	-0.4063146943121523	-0.30223211800187794	-0.08922213420700839	-0.07322327188419081	-0.05122129877924858	0.024310635040142782	0.0469571459901211	0.2071323080331833	0.30250937589868665	0.31474911729194316	0.4536368852100902	0.6779259524609711	0.9146029958010478	0.9244359417007053	1.0412483845661777	1.32909093135837	2.698007611295902	2.9862301403591776	3.8714041291103483	
since the plot like Vertigo or Brian DePalma's Obsession, till to the score by Peter Chase that reminds the sounds of Bernard Herrmann, this little pearl seems to be sight from fews. Remarkable playing by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD are the french one and the English. Directed by a controversial artist as Gilles Mimouni, it could be considered a little homage to the Cinema masterworks. It is a french movie, and as all of them, not for all, we could say a d'essai cinema. Even if not so publicized, it could be remembered for several reason.	-2.869829835598039	-1.0669862894053788	-0.9914304384325446	-0.8447749333000298	-0.7287699913434822	-0.5603805000005861	-0.46535158681191474	-0.420811501632537	-0.351262449567604	-0.31315909494855254	-0.21261405493173266	-0.0059650438643950865	0.12086332236953336	0.17848399076439414	0.24433885665731295	0.3008423799799868	0.3334233750273694	0.3696301365871271	0.4552697976730115	0.46950148744872156	0.50324074401964	0.6802628143513467	1.1619148017660559	1.409597629171723	3.149655986744634	
I was really disappointed in this movie. Those that voted this thing a 10 have a screw lose. The acting was ok, kinda wooden and cardboard. The ending was sorry. I just didn't care for this at all.<br /><br />No way could I recommend this mess.	-4.023537399486993	-1.6569349587053528	-1.4550262620131036	-1.4528222876998131	-1.4244971119118497	-1.2928150345774512	-1.2208806748166483	-0.34639289245240157	-0.28731209249511747	-0.19958295339307938	-0.12224977167613475	-0.11317643243693327	-0.02353171504673321	0.01556518955683408	0.03016401003336879	0.04572944724473143	0.18813673365678862	0.25077185240944766	0.29878221751789075	0.6885866249849156	0.6985031195464173	0.772050636112574	1.9119854129894756	2.046576204514709	4.061684644438798	
A family (A teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. However, their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father, who don't take kindly to newcomers on their patch. While having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister. With the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly, the lad decides to take matters into his own hands..<br /><br />Veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made. At first, you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overwrought bad guys. But then, you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug's sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero. In fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be that they're pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can't defend themselves, is pretty despicable. But of course, there's the obligatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra-less under a very thin T-shirt. Who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs. Right?!<br /><br />The climax centres on the teenager, who up until now hasn't been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a Rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left, right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. It's completely implausible but hey, so is everything else in this film.. so at least you can't accuse it of not being consistent. So, rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist, check out the IMDb pages for Janet Laine Green, Dehl Berti, Stephen Hunter, Jonathan Crombie.. etc. Notice a pattern emerging here? Their careers all hit dead ends. Why? Sit through this, and all will become clear. Remember kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and ALWAYS read the scripts they offer you. Please.. 3/10	-10.430587477231176	-5.198258605750789	-3.547044162507844	-3.4502094253952302	-2.39803771634532	-1.9921478955573417	-1.8634299956236193	-1.3365249927312106	-1.2159666827758118	-0.4121429418052302	-0.3293453112122108	-0.13533041812712623	-0.11513499269032675	-0.008848666734227295	0.07869730064845325	0.1266489489757295	0.1516174558641659	0.2908224926651743	0.5939138005964425	0.817367141882894	1.2705883291880922	1.2770495186206026	3.832698053672129	4.146988745039741	8.696545226797143	
Having seen men Behind the Sun I guess I hoped for an evolution in style & technique to match the larger scale of this movie. I was also quite interested to see someone make a hard-hitting fact-based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of Japanese atrocities, but this is not it. This plays like a bottom-to-mid tier European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - e.g. SS Experiment Camp etc (perhaps more like Deported Women of the Special Section actually). Granted it has a greater scope and more people running around, but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non-actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots, spiced up with the occasional poorly executed 'shock' sequence. The admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power. Watch channel 4's 'The Holocaust' (aired recently (still running?), as of 1 No 2006) for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war (featuring excellent in-context use of actual footage). This is the type of treatment the horror of Nanjing deserves, not this hackneyed exploitation garbage (a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine, but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as a treatment of the subject).	-4.384413895195049	-2.087484659064293	-1.96120116129503	-1.8149004755841354	-1.7096847656328789	-1.2099844461592142	-0.6445078728840474	-0.5876638392974772	-0.5648012422520327	-0.5147138704349863	-0.17224091757917884	-0.16522665665826608	-0.08124512155880444	-0.060535171019708955	-0.05796256051521532	0.016610531757319857	0.1476710651292547	0.1596062185718381	0.6768840787754622	0.7029271307278001	1.0872956749231892	1.0983687355546408	1.2247861886510347	2.5075442707889986	4.558575127292271	
I guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in New York operates but I'd be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here; the fact that these inherent 'defects' were a direct result of the film's low-budget/underground/experimental nature is, I'd say, beside the point. Anyway, for those so inclined, the film features extensive male nudity and Joe Dallesandro, understandably, became an underground  and gay  icon! <br /><br />The episodic structure showing the day-to-day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes: his meeting with (and eventually posing for) an eccentric elderly artist; the one where Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective 'colleagues' including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers  a bespectacled nerd! Perhaps mercifully, the film ran for only 89 minutes against the IMDb's claim that its complete length is 105 (but the latter could well be a mistake)! <br /><br />I had watched a few other of Warhol's 'movies' and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example I've run into yet, BAD (1977), and only slightly better than the likes of MY HUSTLER (1965) which were mostly a strain to sit through. The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but, as the saying goes, you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two 'chapters' had to follow in quick succession... <br /><br />Despite my generally negative reaction to it, FLESH is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the Underground scene of that era, both cinematically and in real life. For the record, an image of Dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of The Smiths' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual Candy Darling (who appears here rather unremarkably) was immortalized in "Candy Says", the opening track of The Velvet Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Although the latter band is my all-time favorite, and one of the reasons for this is that, through their sheerly unique and ground-breaking music, they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own, this is truly a case where I'd much rather experience something aurally instead of visually!	-5.244466982162543	-2.648772296687887	-2.5340842164089237	-2.2133208014213612	-1.857856286454597	-1.763608430286064	-1.1575328803717704	-0.6692605083876427	-0.6360666969283539	-0.353636172865781	-0.29324654851327475	-0.19788102556963105	-0.03890052765189095	-0.012942041137827192	0.03846598159575958	0.1732001211319942	0.19393750261759798	0.2250471693277572	0.5274382736104029	0.63541838625476	0.7391859870625045	1.030054559737354	2.157652278835805	2.668566719895833	5.714193199143038	
Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is a over-hyped, stylized, product. Sure its a one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars appearing in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland. Thumbs down! <br /><br />Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he okay a role like this? Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact he's the sole saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up. Saif Ali Khan doesn't get his due in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted.<br /><br />'Tashan' is a boring film. The films failure at the box office, should you keep away.	-4.4750365219172	-3.436197329807244	-3.3510597766537327	-2.4047117232315047	-1.7893601175837877	-1.7185564485199039	-0.6286846891541025	-0.3878117893128795	-0.1875018173227146	-0.14437578819455227	-0.06531839673993102	-0.033859239658989244	0.21614012374935687	0.4046229230200345	0.43464805598102	0.8010072673095161	0.8654853451577094	1.109787122958248	1.1937670374562233	1.3017619014414843	1.6090869927398583	1.8618669378327932	2.5556179038990314	4.177242537553832	7.246751208848162	
The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" film - the first being Susan Sontag's "Brother Carl" (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop": "One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell." Pretty much the same thing here. "Interiors" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking into the middle distance: "I don't like who I'm becoming.") The directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. ("I read a poem of yours the other day. It was in - I don't know - The New Yorker." "Oh. That was an old poem. I reworked it.") Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity").<br /><br />The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's "Winter Light," the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. It all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.<br /><br />Allen's later "serious" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. I'll take "Interiors." Woody's rarely made a funnier movie.	-4.647679461265764	-3.1662601839414575	-2.850219910798608	-1.602430881456808	-1.218803661302959	-1.0143123300950745	-0.4977856020710154	-0.3917133051451297	-0.25309892915518856	-0.20950932960033922	0.042560455633047285	0.18691380064091018	0.25983267406978705	0.34328518015930126	0.3582956827878514	0.3583186319081486	0.4259201055014339	0.5575425901873884	0.5700921304801302	0.7173467551310652	0.8844070206335871	1.7453191326614663	1.8918032261096456	2.864773912629493	5.309709440067868	
For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is or was, it was a children's reality show about real kids living at summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. It was full of romance, friendships, fights, overcoming your fears, and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months. It was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t.v. regularly, but is amazing non-the-less. The show was never dull and always attracted my attention. It's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it's like before going. Plus Disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that's at a camp for like only a week. The length of the camps where perfect for this show, and the environment they where in was fantastic. They where camps all over the U.S., that each provided unique activities for the campers. It was a truly amazing, unscripted show.	-2.9272358836082164	-2.2247614984322706	-1.2830273890866821	-1.01932687401074	-0.8593491349367967	-0.1696491327515292	-0.10799911826789707	-0.004263343401152947	0.10257405112996869	0.12082727511474452	0.4138636989155998	0.5805929954204081	0.6202438698980715	0.6599050267731619	0.6754226787266687	0.8201551019570918	0.8238290523563859	0.8520238976332813	0.9298909508329694	1.0236991595837996	1.2814414061092523	1.2818213366731908	2.014972911246537	2.0393262516082027	3.509238573288591	
I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot, anyway. I've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims.<br /><br />First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a shapely woman's behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point. The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.<br /><br />The rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he's murdered) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level. Really, it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.<br /><br />Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing.<br /><br />I'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. However, it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll.<br /><br />This is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.	-9.711604058930654	-5.039398489737441	-5.005695694243287	-4.8723674667539	-4.580815281489501	-2.3899840131648507	-1.7998334337594892	-1.0747296162585944	-1.0656483524109146	-0.9042821794444545	-0.6483580046024682	-0.5889781473727035	-0.19933508120487192	-0.08949690013761585	0.3740442246865953	0.4250365306752941	0.6901836200595846	0.7863543258701445	0.9331206399290296	1.2227932841684577	1.709898735438903	1.7293531336120278	3.245305544918408	5.5875284258359645	10.51746308687149	
So you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film, and you might be thinking to yourself, "Huh. There were sure a bunch of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30." Funny thing is, most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person, or at best a small, coordinated group of "Open House" groupies. The truth, my friends, is that this film is truly unwatchable. Just because it's "independent" doesn't mean it gets a free pass. If you're going to make a musical, whether on film or on stage, whether on Broadway or at the local community playhouse, you should probably make sure that (a.) your actors can sing, (b.) your actors can dance, (c.) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can't save this one. It's one of those unfortunate movie-going experiences where I actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved.	-2.744228484914697	-2.0128198686120053	-1.5549363877590516	-1.4534758249941153	-1.0757330198213537	-0.972603614785452	-0.5564221723259773	-0.11838628354826769	-0.03402873921556408	0.06173675235173694	0.12967416331124826	0.15047086148001373	0.16005942355560518	0.22108666365668148	0.3319368379742009	0.3408712834726162	0.4357246829970431	0.48453125706622546	0.6678298169361011	0.8452120342389657	0.9377105182276328	1.105506004691715	1.4727615020218192	1.8069501798871217	4.107626453895917	
Oh f*cking hell, where should I start... First of all; this show is just another stupid American non-funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor. The American way of laughing-track business makes the whole thing even worse. How come I can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? Pretty stupid, eh? This show is only for those American people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons for example). I simply can't understand what is so good about "Reba" that it has lasted for long a while in television. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in so many ways and it simply isn't funny at all. I could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as "Reba", but why the hell they had to run it here in Finland. If I see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show sucks ass even more than these kind of American "comedies" usually does. This is simply horrible. Do yourself a favor; don't ever watch this peace of sh*t. <br /><br />Well I leave the commenting for those who now this language better. Thanks for your (possible) interest.	-7.748721559532043	-4.395169613757455	-4.378677095843929	-3.539785078375921	-3.5046194030416093	-2.017534747586117	-1.6515443282516746	-1.439934806575169	-1.1658905052946642	-0.5971850859216512	-0.5330718880310096	-0.27095850237041774	0.01068834826504629	0.1141156278725286	0.3161894257039923	0.400682159586511	0.4351703603310888	0.7974583144607018	1.088416123839095	1.2440626745251104	1.511518646405097	1.9101944568669718	2.2261122900581993	5.023466960436037	8.202793032149385	
While all of the Fleischer/Famous Studios "Superman" cartoons are excellent, "Billion Dollar Limited," the third in the series, is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation, plot, and pacing. Why it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar as Best Animated Short for 1942 (Incredibly enough, only the first one was) in inexplicable.<br /><br />Here, Lois Lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the U.S. Mint. Masked gangsters in their super-powered (for 1942) car take off after the train, determined to get that gold. Without giving too much away, what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience, with truth, justice, and Superman triumphant at the end.<br /><br />As they did in all the Fleischer/Famous Superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane on radio, have the voice work honors here, and Fleischer perennial Jack Mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys, as well.	-2.866155533880912	-1.5815948449037625	-1.4660359342295226	-1.415143072358962	-1.3749183911355412	-0.6477831727152986	-0.5925953893080756	-0.5052606213786212	-0.17654916669509052	-0.1341414891018174	-0.10666474223080205	-0.10371115496728336	-0.030636224430203002	5.140563679124225E-4	0.07041894294525847	0.29250896907987334	0.3229330000915769	0.44154713750565516	0.45232664610461965	0.4800585982752637	0.5795650390624976	0.6562075391695383	0.8304895355367944	1.629871912308089	3.7467133996043542	
This movie is from the 80s, but it looks like it was made in the stone age. The effects are way too cheesy. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, which was why I bought the movie. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screentime. She would most likely deny all involvement.<br /><br />In short, there is no part of this movie worth seeing, except to laugh at how bad it sucks. Rent this to see the worst film ever made, bar none.	-3.4667841473801273	-1.6128395785923177	-1.2844723144998664	-1.2309013932418216	-1.118246366835257	-0.989736756621763	-0.8833785713537338	-0.47750034942949926	-0.20450576958108035	-0.16927708771759353	-0.1324092349043137	-0.1002529609370388	-0.017756906289794788	0.010215830779102292	0.16737529162688988	0.19168560151057434	0.2502293916686467	0.26520065354819977	0.3255221150255089	0.3412794013101862	0.6729202565753123	0.7541449270000662	1.4091249777820873	1.5662869148847904	3.7372909095189937	
This is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over-the-hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once - thirty years previously - was their hideout; one ho-hum duologue between two ageing rock musos; a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence (plus epilogue) involving heist artist wannabe Edward Baer and current 'hot' property Anna Magloulis which has its moments. No movie in which Jean Rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over-the-hill quintet, indeed the film is worth seeing for Rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look.	-0.7369791549034674	-0.6166917231669166	-0.5085415492161353	-0.3802406556413225	-0.325141193829412	-0.2972760163623026	-0.22376698445484672	-0.10263334881811348	-0.07764437983253654	-0.0675356089552493	0.04985467077214208	0.06625882790198309	0.1782097116465734	0.19134538410095842	0.1975860799003987	0.2510853980460326	0.2589011797134231	0.2650643254345703	0.29511920552848847	0.6826324872018162	0.8350741995440233	0.8580402526793409	0.8661054386746694	0.8888598233872976	0.9855234142958936	
Even though this movie came out a year before I was born, it is definetely one of my favorite comedies. It stars Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he doesn't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like. His son, Norman, is now grown up and living on his own. When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie--when Ben gets to Norman's apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in drag ("Norman... Is that you?"). The movie had me laughing from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although a lot of the content is stereotypical, I didn't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled, and it even has a good ending. Highly recommended.	-2.2431151453660245	-2.0228614078815457	-1.4980201644331137	-1.3073982235172072	-0.9250741110713241	-0.7587433123684668	-0.4395118658026982	-0.31696607315549963	-0.01090878424901548	0.026884821525727687	0.08351936770462433	0.1364011472048297	0.19161377203194205	0.2573503917322708	0.26724127703442413	0.27248071024601084	0.5401300565896966	0.5985857643120011	0.715363000979357	0.8638437080450508	0.9021165565756304	1.224897601896677	1.7250140873577453	2.4685639534851846	2.874241254632059	
I loved this. It starts out as a fairly normal, slightly ponderous French art movie and then all of a sudden, halfway through it's turned on it's head. This part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one. Sadly, the ending doesn't make much sense, which is a great shame. Oh yes, and it's brilliantly filmed.	-1.7557640933517333	-1.3914610153884754	-1.145536396501797	-1.0083583281199455	-0.9820254718541737	-0.6672447708308701	-0.4856780258879446	-0.14766902046134178	-0.055658523238770116	-0.03514359533815419	0.11566498854827847	0.12267142333620512	0.14234798611383592	0.24301262296026588	0.2543066610256978	0.2825438649944697	0.2941564524915063	0.5410121014144572	0.5601307531715883	0.648622487430525	0.6888448719645255	0.8628334785570675	1.7951769582889954	1.8453883579973895	1.8812881780616395

This movie is masterly directed by Clive barker, he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters. I think there is a sequel missing for this one, Barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring Lord of illusions, that is one I think was a real garbage. But I also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel NBreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films.	-1.738425126051782	-1.1319058009730605	-0.9714640289836701	-0.8963523409872449	-0.8612489077058997	-0.8205824242435202	-0.4781261365734507	-0.36936358154919563	-0.28102730974224766	-0.24981424364197785	-0.24930868475477913	-0.11829443202854242	-0.09543518915402158	-0.009841510201706427	0.05151367293253893	0.2012564875466737	0.20383614074507064	0.21912867075195241	0.2783646281789677	0.27875060779660316	0.29024016615292203	0.33431032879576417	0.40712129935845703	1.0408892729573693	1.9455540917721068	
Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of George Armstrong Custer. The dashing, jovial Flynn essays Custer from his days at West Point as a reckless, headstrong cadet, through the Civil War years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the nonpareil Indian fighter whose blunder at the Little Big Horn is excused as a sacrifice by Custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, Flynn's co-star in several other films, scores as the devoted, adoring Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn looks the part as the fierce Sioux chief Crazy Horse. The film's battle scenes are excellent. The Civil War battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which Custer, seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers, hammers the Confederate army into submission. Custer's last fight against the Indians is a grand spectacle, a savage clash between red men and white, with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men. Great direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music by Max Steiner make this film a Hollywood classic.	-1.2471789165380847	-1.217457269694556	-1.0760369703267267	-0.8324402501943994	-0.82154502688582	-0.8135866179031445	-0.7721426308767126	-0.45684647943907464	-0.36210675149184585	-0.02670311920551041	0.004068912963575824	0.022554845559447312	0.028372355927335488	0.28597579712318144	0.3346193329508921	0.3527568326254429	0.4492414506946285	0.45743048187831425	0.48369184979323343	0.6009105133725652	0.6160731612665982	0.8978400001649884	1.365519416955935	1.7429366091486214	2.3592396825653297	
SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Not really a very good movie... but I did like the idea behind it... and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with. The movie is ostensibly an "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off "danger zone" and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune... everyone else just winds up dead. The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad. None of the "real" people seem real at all. The actors playing the killers are kind of fun... because they are portraying cheesy and over-the-top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types... and that's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show. The movie pretends to be done all in one take... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly (to hide the "cuts" from one take to another, I would imagine).	-2.464839228302399	-1.5395781368646682	-1.4901076738144843	-1.1856630892307023	-0.8133771846524557	-0.5028312448917063	-0.36299506479443294	-0.24960661594587955	-0.24069761255066024	-0.20026022141349592	-0.1811472718753706	-0.15134632000082118	-0.11688323878215647	0.04591856012114645	0.06626179432640308	0.11908219953753918	0.19581625249833082	0.23841890096976567	0.5232228613575619	0.7308190460199859	0.7991677247095998	0.9518847648321735	1.1117090309924225	1.9411330589338571	3.0720941903975074	
I usually don't comment anything (i read the others opinions)... but this, this one I _have_ to comment... I was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action, F-117 and other hi-tech stuff, but by only few first minutes and I changed my mind... Lousy acting, lousy script and a big science fiction.<br /><br />It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen...<br /><br />Simply... don't bother...<br /><br />And one more thing, before any movie I usually check user comments and rating on this site... 3.7 points and I give this movie a try, now I'm wondering WHO rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ??????????	-1.6405893895061072	-1.240360469764161	-1.1525629093042942	-1.1304951939409593	-0.9785850455888071	-0.676697586120396	-0.38592497147824245	-0.37482243881342286	-0.37039189713182735	-0.23413612394074923	-0.20413742198339047	-0.16621837185074012	-0.09044305853160026	-0.07131975802164044	0.08018021923007254	0.12276996092242842	0.1716150612681659	0.29225663178274114	0.3250662216446397	0.41431493452425333	0.4201236665004078	0.6183453927207676	0.6420099343198514	1.0914179812711309	1.6049428659826108	
To be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it, but i'm never one to let others influence my viewings, in fact i'm more likely to watch something out of defiance!. Bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away. The picture isn't very good, and is in fact very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture. Sadly it doesn't, and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can't help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film, nobody in the cast come out with any credit, with lead man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extreme.<br /><br />Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10	-2.737080422927839	-1.1324732155788473	-1.118665623882825	-1.0841135063478131	-1.0537337009686232	-0.6728299285172715	-0.49904083236204877	-0.4660844948799767	-0.3772047969637793	-0.3535846489357144	-0.32976825642131724	-0.32752039461615223	-0.31221333586957534	-0.20140670009922368	-0.09554344561406047	-0.0034973543913835864	0.20144386028772324	0.22620305003839417	0.4276280335410122	0.4443947186995768	0.5104654796189382	0.6291027578499837	0.8266391563963458	1.04337829824929	2.35326909708203	
This whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular "Amelie", both having the wonderful Audrey Tautou playing the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of France in recent memory.<br /><br />The film deals with chance, as its English title indicates. The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects. From the start, the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the film's context seems to work well.<br /><br />A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film. Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper. Irene, it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as Irene. It seems they are destined to one another from the start, but alas, they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, doesn't have a lot to do until the end, but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part. The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings.<br /><br />We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected.	-3.4126035207555816	-2.1807293219609294	-1.7328887395127304	-1.4622555284793972	-0.6029015839956635	-0.5390157665260126	-0.13810950899262214	0.09279685783777236	0.38920150392150543	0.42545541164725814	0.4390487047639292	0.4576641085457842	0.6018838188963902	0.6252523110823796	0.6492046341425761	0.8974425787309472	0.9013592423797026	0.9648743403488536	1.2610192268296627	1.4346112267927098	1.4419795213613085	1.6919580596646735	2.4296350066446983	3.6624550400635933	3.9268955596397705	
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller. It´s definitively NOT a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. This could be instead a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. Okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything. We gave 4/10.	-3.8840636213751822	-1.7366196699600982	-1.5601506737557311	-1.4482994702472336	-1.395835510420082	-1.281883542381682	-1.1772095201966775	-0.19829295397572522	-0.15170314499614926	-0.10091891603435749	-0.04884704308457205	0.012054383711726105	0.03525586726074717	0.1077089008271696	0.1633587780955214	0.16705273832823397	0.20925664508442532	0.3674883491878155	0.3922246903325502	0.5255561425738197	0.5625074123493072	0.7287049719193711	1.9682206926028467	2.0163918583027107	4.050344561449184	
I expected alot from this movie. Kinda like Lee as a Naustradamous like caracter but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can't even explain this movie. It had wooden acting, terrible script from pieces from the Bible like hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But that was at the end! The rest of it I had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn't. This movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in China where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. The convent end up being the key to the misshappenings. The whole movie is missleading and boring. One of Lees worst.	-5.14473352697856	-2.4189715745442095	-2.356776187644255	-2.304189112078629	-2.1229215226607443	-1.9630546929056751	-1.5666809025093353	-0.3379707159349431	-0.3376872147046358	-0.20660699292935247	-0.19493826917355844	-0.13925503674150752	-0.06535473376704626	-0.044060252253350515	-3.85309890343237E-4	0.167807515988103	0.2517959298961894	0.3371804673341095	0.6701684084538204	0.7459501089538942	0.756367952015873	1.0637986382753828	2.066082654176597	2.680609076826811	5.3778435111528875	
Aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting, this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia.

This is very nearly a perfect film. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never told so succinctly. This is really about the failure of trust, of the human condition. The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society, every single day? The film is very much structured like a Hitchcock thriller. Except, there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone is participating in the con. Could anything be more true?<br /><br />Don't miss the soundtrack. It is wonderful.	-2.220273978752607	-1.777840312901513	-1.7713832978074477	-1.4979445814319599	-0.7913317722168527	-0.6839774978655592	-0.6650571534060872	-0.6375248819797417	-0.41937907892260606	-0.18352921305855469	-0.019983684536870716	0.1729107808158198	0.2445694437334774	0.2866460936645767	0.34273531870474566	0.4639973028323355	0.478728390608514	0.4809756747437851	0.528269930878982	0.6866942889906797	1.1405386833675197	1.179170980093929	2.273841115069032	3.0665800792437032	4.492233479530328	
After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy "Chainsaw massacre"-feeling, everything falls apart.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who have seen enough of these "fooled-ya"-movies can figure this out.<br /><br />This movie is mader with one thing in mind: To depict brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? Will this be next for us movie-goers? The torture and abuse of children? Whats wrong with you people? Lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind.	-4.674702766877188	-2.0055963773475938	-1.6535456425025403	-1.482253312892888	-1.4709996344301342	-1.2849565968846652	-0.8663596409266411	-0.5916771287885063	-0.5578895593288655	-0.23668897541675113	-0.19024866248061265	0.00864799713588861	0.023918294668076767	0.04026135207689803	0.22319502526921678	0.3116308211006188	0.3571944460738686	0.3700525192825493	0.3921986029240363	0.4425840435586151	0.49568953067212296	0.6039407990572354	1.906579780344623	2.427741256973618	4.742920912506604	
Nothing happens.<br /><br />Then characters with no personality don't develop.<br /><br />Then the end never comes because there's no beginning and no middle.<br /><br />There are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren't even allowed to be, because this movie isn't even THERE. There's no "is" in this movie because there's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point. There's nothing! <br /><br />There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn't even worth your time, so if you're really interested, I'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something. You'll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headache, and impatience.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB	-3.6090816914244375	-2.0196365100977607	-1.87796718455663	-1.4722585942940696	-1.3044055977095548	-1.213964234399936	-0.9774417610174124	-0.1920285668557115	-0.09075490657313938	-0.08136947791650233	0.14736475889510295	0.1897667272110188	0.2134074348905513	0.29597309981963504	0.3102976347353944	0.47688869548052676	0.5215573051417981	0.5410341566844735	0.6075304218272188	0.7199051400428997	1.0651180824550535	1.130390923464804	1.2712620132602848	2.3761317188848183	4.503086358590209	
My rating refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG-1 which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addicting. When the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! Starting around Season 5, the show took a different focus - still good, but different.<br /><br />The series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the "Stargate". The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt.<br /><br />The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own. What happens next was always unpredictable.<br /><br />The characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed. Their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor. They are simply fun to watch.<br /><br />Starting somewhere around Season 5, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (a lot more political/strategic oriented) and interdependent. The characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature.<br /><br />One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. They are simply can't-miss shows. They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 Seasons and you'll likely be hooked. If you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to.	-5.568112843514583	-3.3226617846544757	-2.6368035097758495	-1.574173538325725	-1.3641628689640939	-0.1766413044890873	0.08285523652971201	0.19709457635496808	0.41113660878372227	0.6451927342684214	0.9192281152288668	0.972765176216923	1.0016716747036956	1.1039856296075394	1.3243720524255542	1.492914581593487	1.541050435038144	1.643672362015989	1.7218573879090473	1.9645963945791276	2.065848855061911	2.2540575293981853	3.2853251383797604	3.9865835705504944	6.202612529557542	
This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very BAD story. Stella is so terribly crude, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither ever learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down? I don't think so. Stella is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /><br />Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. "I can't have our child living this way!" Spare me. <br /><br />This story tells me one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes. And that is simply a load of hogwash.	-4.625039259920573	-2.783619217196812	-2.40308886157925	-2.31751007105133	-1.4260722701464674	-1.4232566880740691	-1.2810056212404062	-0.9106057377902156	-0.37062500027679357	-0.20007444233354205	-0.05038803445807867	0.052485842918063255	0.07197741771981928	0.12962003388252474	0.1852882750203122	0.22662890293644383	0.3822964917699278	0.7480941526939937	0.8146499985232446	0.9093590163270576	0.95038856820091	0.9800002745693379	1.0446305465541161	2.691830343807227	5.2202866881760555	
Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of:he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him.<br /><br />The main subject of this Bullock vehicle ,all the ideas,almost everything was already in Hitchcock's classic " Rope":the two students who commit a gratuitous crime, Nietsche's philosophy,and the clues that the boys disseminate ,the Master was the first to transfer them to the screen.And with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force.<br /><br />"Murder by numbers " does not take place in a single room,like "the rope" ,mind you.And ,what a supreme originality,it pits two cops against the evil youngsters;and ,you would never guess it,these two cops are very different:actually,Bullock plays the part of woman living like a man ,and her partner (Chaplin) is as shy as a clueless girlie.The two boys' performances are not really mind-boggling ,not as good ,as ,say ,that of Edward Norton in "primal fear" .<br /><br />Well,you know ," Rope" was so good ....	-1.4019460472256002	-1.076055689660416	-0.9232527751901141	-0.8144215485827151	-0.8093572118366081	-0.3603465152323618	-0.2916754063935905	-0.2896945950369869	-0.22652647286868346	-0.21757137473009863	-0.2030503883410227	-0.05910309583891071	0.03726007490452962	0.0882675619639177	0.12308248155701983	0.21447612388948156	0.2798384507374291	0.2811477566884173	0.3779224104294572	0.4642478300295023	0.5085504212437838	0.5709350622877045	0.7342345372701867	1.0731660731494284	1.7732202860496282	
This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into. All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie. The prank phone calls, halloween night, a psycho, and one knife! Its absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. As for the making of the movie, its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary. I mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of "Scary Movie" for example. At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie.	-4.650944016521501	-3.257462726375048	-2.815223106084419	-2.6515526259487707	-2.4449799325383963	-1.8371680793427871	-1.498522693875612	-0.9352245622499659	-0.23705234098499467	-0.1509830879960321	-0.10204154221103906	0.02667228160156801	0.2757004946620705	0.3010350407256852	0.6988726592771821	0.7004195000148726	0.7637797791967587	0.7743443880820664	0.8495373813723617	0.9510242471913843	0.9768595242528457	1.6878315816596174	1.9854333872975123	4.341345324200575	6.990663576132272	
***Possible spoilers***<br /><br />I recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. Ron Ely is just right as Doc. Cool, calm, almost always in control(and with an occasional twinkle in his eye). What more can one ask for? I have never read a Doc Savage book, so I don't know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derring-do. Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I don't think is fair. The difference in budget is astounding(Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has. Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right. The Sousa music is catchy(love that theme song- Every time I watch the film, I end up humming the theme for days).The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy. Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper throughout the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib (really!). Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. I give it 7 out of 10.<br /><br />Doc Savage, Doc Savage...thank the lord he's here!	-3.5002897689312764	-2.45486651113268	-2.1537246968171186	-1.4626855078710943	-1.0532507263649415	-0.8705142746367195	-0.5410968367024427	-0.22912931890719745	0.07099595236688065	0.08444688482749278	0.5299675451553026	0.5901072705566737	0.6995351429498319	0.7249065305797805	0.850547697705138	0.8692539533409099	1.0191274317783705	1.0607139029698283	1.2577533143129236	1.3550797501220047	1.6165716784321964	1.7256431718357115	2.600072387045244	3.4609309083093676	3.9012890318477838	
I'd have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a "Lifetime" presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether "set" there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L.A. etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale.<br /><br />But if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site, it's this movie. Certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one. It's also been done pretty often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.<br /><br />Not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre I've seen. I caught it by chance on a mid-day Friday, at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. I'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. And, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother) whom I'd seen in some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend) who was outstanding as "Gramma," the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from "Rounders." <br /><br />The chance meeting and coupling between both leads' best friends, as a sub-story romance, with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here (in fact, it enhances it).<br /><br />Checking some other comments, I agree completely with those which are the most positive. The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.<br /><br />I love films with a "harder edge:" "Rounders;" the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;" even the classics like "Casablanca," "Gone With the Wind," "Citizen Kane." But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding. With a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle." And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films, as well.	-4.0809950577568905	-3.8270811229169364	-3.27783845185495	-3.141385779730601	-2.106991794071751	-1.8012761178305896	-1.3508227037295737	-0.9595755636607097	-0.8164879583046143	-0.5594474832938938	-0.18996122453554237	0.1053226332013454	0.16515697513401267	0.25849010418789964	0.5859950244292991	0.6430256734610841	0.7486638231635989	0.7846089483189289	1.7911552817453427	1.8065952121424094	1.9006882859890524	2.1469982395685956	3.86832083618598	5.233891182069058	8.234660850625707	
While it would be easy and accurate to go into why 'Reba' is at its heart indicative of many 'family-oriented sitcoms' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms, the real truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows, and the lead star is completely out of her element. While I'm sure Ms. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports that, being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is far, far removed from reality.<br /><br />Reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put-upon woman of which her entire family is centered. Yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character. I could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence, and to make a show around her seems very short-sighted and indicative of most 'family-oriented' programming: to push a sitcom full of men-stupid/women-do-everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can't afford cable.<br /><br />The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard PAX ripoff....just.	-4.754398769402471	-2.0583912612847497	-1.9746939752180035	-1.88220643755004	-1.8755752691616883	-1.2689553081026632	-0.6843956101931732	-0.6080206109792353	-0.47367472357917206	-0.4721019035914187	-0.40424252997598575	-0.23155895753340522	-0.1761388886947116	-0.13986367587484333	0.23117612531463058	0.2909935783835378	0.4125299151275103	0.4215528820416897	0.49516067398875013	0.5665800289816444	0.6288542782174484	0.7754890149519342	1.8419562813252779	2.30385862128286	4.842444795823545	
This film deals with the atrocity in Derry 30 years ago which is commonly known as Bloody Sunday.<br /><br />The film is well researched, acted and directed. It is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the Saville enquiry. The film puts the atrocity into context of the time. It also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity. The disgraceful white-wash that was the Widgery Tribunal is also dealt with.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking. When the Saville report comes out, watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is.	-1.7742731243169465	-1.7141443033051629	-1.165975161677559	-0.7344065808488696	-0.37069576875269183	-0.22810173352881868	-0.1758144238070756	-0.07549698294061524	0.07361650982090417	0.08101890855550115	0.1002118598139935	0.1299821516957399	0.17546486987052334	0.17977732332304175	0.22234194861532972	0.24784198418718822	0.4387472009083778	0.46283905976753287	0.6074854511699556	0.618576761535881	0.6371663835587215	1.0508437188116715	1.18854312846177	1.9460607583547973	2.328224443237536	
This is the biggest pile of crap I have ever watched. DO NOT RENT! The makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie. It starts with some what of a plot, then fades fast to nothing. I think I would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover. The actors were awful, the plot faded fast, filming left to much work to be done. Not one good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie you will waste your money. I really enjoy National Lampoon movies, but this was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce, and learn to direct. I feel I should sue these a-holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost.	-6.417798517642471	-3.7282554061766398	-3.4762568115506576	-2.753037373407686	-2.6990890044129685	-2.608208502116007	-2.1105742543922648	-1.1156796858755522	-0.31278128823753537	-0.29510807299517977	-0.2266874544717862	-0.17963574055412493	-0.073026590696326	-0.050411184811108206	0.10053100538935793	0.17606731996065322	0.4435417992008401	0.6803234143285725	0.8699689049097937	1.0738336093622372	1.1310164544575134	1.2170726527325584	2.133615013793979	4.123119120342442	6.942954380909547	
Just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before. It just keeps getting better and better. You simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech, the slow deliberate action, everything being exactly in place.<br /><br />Truly one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite!!!	-1.097365235648074	-0.9081340174808855	-0.686787403821641	-0.4780142812536514	-0.37069313649754243	-0.2405491455839308	-0.20533648039209967	-0.16171469938770458	-0.12374392384229108	-0.11739692329248633	-0.0299387213655454	0.011607489081809863	0.04720286915387567	0.04808422287670389	0.11756363817215826	0.16511875878603302	0.2390199700674538	0.2592658274507779	0.3766142524701405	0.4307312957065237	0.5157802397945056	0.6253013378728993	0.9663314559136144	1.2001783586311556	1.2314095744248859	
The movie, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, was brilliantly made. It starts with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day)- who is a former stage singer, and their young son- my guess is about 10 years old, who are traveling through Morroco for leisure. On the bus, the bump into a French government agent, and they are a little too nice to him. He is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought. He wants to carry this information out to someone, so he goes to the only person he, even slightly, knows: James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to travel to London, because that is where his son is, and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be. The movie is very suspenseful. There are many twists and turns (typical Hitchcock movie). Also, it has just the right amount of comic relief. In addition to all of that, it won an Oscar for Doris Day's performance of "Que sara, sara." This movie is very good. It is hard to find a problem about it. I would certainly reccomend it to all Hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. I give this movie an "A-" only because it is a little bit predictable.	-3.4162848092107456	-2.7224858511402426	-2.0820788475465912	-1.9784620326534315	-1.3855760282470109	-0.7214924597057404	-0.5598444879217357	-0.4154255794744277	-0.2908586692291755	-0.2471446104568867	-0.05559522377044131	0.185746697838348	0.2982715479691241	0.3704693353031797	0.4756586533334577	0.7824239723542215	0.7858143992177109	0.916510904414617	0.9430467839566736	0.9764889487775305	1.4747277479688703	1.8861268617049154	3.713063736085892	3.7362465498151334	5.489732604150687	
We watched this in my Women's Health Issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie. I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie I will show to my children. The professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women, but this movie was more than that. It is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite.	-3.0259666548229376	-2.2596978166425195	-1.1193591625225512	-1.0502001449733542	-0.9104671938985669	-0.3512925865871314	-0.3018641338421598	-0.25254016941226276	-0.17250755380696725	-0.11186054725631389	0.18246734031370684	0.4042047098052289	0.5420147220413731	0.5429462641368297	0.7870534569135774	0.8052980590079657	0.8323842678365649	0.9667819289710273	1.1937203022131055	1.3088627728036044	1.4901503563854004	1.5894216172645779	2.069858856846316	2.3259609442677136	2.9098897569627273	
IMDb lists this as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68. Doesn't really matter, except that it's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first art works to merge the two apparently) in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction isn't really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful. Certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s, and deserves to be better known.	-0.7883229275081465	-0.7079098147197843	-0.6932352180941106	-0.5190181657661079	-0.4655475355696167	-0.18535786526812587	-0.16411840853513093	-0.14380721710411426	-0.08954929410157567	-0.07009057245911673	-0.06479380212389217	0.005555820808338496	0.022795940853821486	0.036763302079548275	0.041022160014397124	0.04282479360489876	0.04665563631059265	0.18541829324121037	0.24667308507285893	0.4049080975804569	0.7214563732257814	0.7308720743718182	0.738144209506999	0.7394076446174341	1.220340450531206	
This juvenile, bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens' bodies, desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years. How ? By burning up gas and equating a fast, reckless car (or plane) with freedom.<br /><br />The plot borrows heavily from Mister Rogers' neighborhood (if it were run my an oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style).<br /><br />Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film is set in a post-gas-crisis world in which an all-powerful government doesn't want you to (*ahem*) drive your car and burn gas. Sort of the opposite of today's Enron-and-Bush, oil-grabbing, SUV-pushing government.<br /><br />This juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable. But wait...there's more. Although the film is set in the future, we're not shown any signs of future technology, beyond a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks... exactly like today. Same clothing, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternate energy.<br /><br />The acting is flat and flavorless. Even scenes which could have been gritty or moving, buddy-flick, honor, romance, horror... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase.<br /><br />Continuity is lacking-- the jet flown by Burgess Meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again.<br /><br />The plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a Dukes of Hazzard episode.<br /><br />Even die-hard car-film and SF fans should avoid this film like month-old roadkill, unless you enjoy heckling Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank.	-10.075187211409652	-4.5677362880731485	-4.54098120196541	-4.431196109968782	-4.079153043813683	-2.548126502427389	-2.1029260355561608	-1.2254019320091916	-1.0023239714305447	-0.48353344398866743	-0.43021009250854003	-0.42318085049942017	-0.15610975161601165	0.03648201859344784	0.07283268704592606	0.3436058162455803	0.5873564071935853	0.767878346016966	0.9131901642284118	1.1413682637486158	1.3264430708657426	1.6901619616109769	4.204145402921379	4.759387904099812	10.113875402689986	
The plot for Descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. And no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I saw.<br /><br />If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch "Descent", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.	-3.805292898632381	-1.9083562943057801	-1.6425558953683053	-1.558067970671545	-1.5013224448065767	-1.2376928401700054	-0.7868722816932785	-0.4516295490520231	-0.40714328049968107	-0.3827191469225469	-0.3316392663488791	-0.0751659599387647	0.06163175337053983	0.06664242460767734	0.09312123349638558	0.10617126406252497	0.2111228579281689	0.35960493444344677	0.5423480261754785	0.679885938073166	0.7201965561345889	0.859564161726195	1.2235228901046467	2.0511747933532	4.103863562885803	
At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner'.. at least where I come from. A bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. Has one of the weirdest array of costumes I've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. GREAT job on the dubbing too guys(!) Best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck, he just gets out his gun and BANG! Why not do that earlier? It's a mystery. As is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. I'm still puzzling over that one myself now.. 2/10	-4.911001036600233	-3.2211470670537428	-1.1334724998759893	-1.1324436113847471	-0.8475706497436324	-0.8426254108411482	-0.6172112148096495	-0.5919609583442711	-0.4920398369322982	-0.4828631961800454	-0.40310330722724375	-0.38999089010943366	-0.26202425497643966	-0.25338488308104057	-0.23069067065003526	-0.20315072501878517	-0.12409683391867787	0.08535393443984894	0.2633380208921384	0.29063901781020934	0.8669163396477679	1.07711157367589	1.2393673528081572	2.237410009548235	3.631332037937827	
I watched Gomeda on movie theater at my city. My friend took away me and I was really curious what would be it looked like. Well, I must say This movie was not a horror,may be we can say that is 'Fantsastic experimentation'...OK here I go anyway... But there was a lot of shooting,acting,dramatic,theatrical and storytelling problems.I can understand because of director is very young and Gomeda is his first feature film.OK Directing of this film was not pretty bad,I see.Unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline.And there is no powerful Gothic scenes.As a horror movie it really fails, no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring. Some people say 'Gomeda' is an art movie, but I could not see a laughable,terrible and breoken off art movie like that.So, how can we say it is an art movie!Just funny!	-2.3770224085053266	-1.4264319784569515	-1.3803300892410273	-1.303782035742667	-1.262611377958571	-0.7133584413804965	-0.5527879949953367	-0.5242317140815739	-0.3643140992345884	-0.332332368790904	-0.31085022806545565	-0.292879973498898	-0.2834069262181745	-0.23660217145546306	0.004404451541442492	0.11180757133065464	0.2043893480412312	0.4825412563163909	0.5001086450177257	0.7029325130628736	0.7972206708383898	0.836957697387339	1.0593848128649788	1.6235953491061643	2.5955913991499857	
Enough is enough...sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead. The first Tremors movie was great. The second one was ridiculous. The third one was nauseating. The tv series was depressingly awful. And this movie just drives the stake deeper.<br /><br />Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have the series set in the Wild West, in the 1800's, and they fight graboids. Like a rehash of the first one, they have to learn how to beat them all over again. Mildly entertaining I suppose. Otherwise this straight-to-video release, just like Tremors 2 and 3, is just going way too far. Oh and I continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place...did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be history-making, so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared. <br /><br />Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy. Avoid this garbage.	-6.9356227965744255	-3.423389134454398	-2.9688919823850557	-2.85514595825974	-2.614583440606875	-2.039355594846106	-1.0912669853856785	-0.6639336562968796	-0.6465819539430973	-0.6088160105776941	-0.4453255699051145	-0.17690117059560956	0.15479472956725707	0.21603306952420137	0.23026589266468822	0.37415238366976034	0.4538470234807673	0.8774830974882657	0.8859124528926319	0.9014842870175792	0.9399003200932047	1.2973251204913703	2.3924695304553967	3.8021474962286743	7.193576744272658	
I'm relieved the later reviews have turned sour - reading all the positive feedback, I was starting to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different than everyone else's in the world. Everything in this movie rang false to me...the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the corny narration, all of it. As each scene unfolded I kept thinking, "People don't act like this." It's relentlessly heavy-handed and maudlin. In a way I think the movie bullies you into liking it, or pretending to like it, because it's Serious and about Real People and confronts Issues. But man, it really did not work for me.	-3.1664022010206008	-1.4147374979862477	-1.254103837445134	-1.220533621902735	-1.1851481895814864	-1.178396457064898	-1.1052203492626675	-0.2835497453397338	-0.08858968193667138	-0.07120012382845804	-0.05588004082789641	0.046459956779753626	0.055002239374682314	0.08610689049639378	0.14527877539064143	0.1539212847794797	0.28160062033177224	0.28667695640997737	0.421473154412009	0.4402244031383456	0.5735818284479576	0.6664716074695436	1.363259100318926	1.8802805944394698	3.8008749876676737	
Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie.<br /><br />This type of movies are actually made for flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than C-grade movies. Or even some C-grade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan. The much hyped and over-confidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deserved.<br /><br />In my view, this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films' banner. How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi's ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last. The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences.<br /><br />The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences' hearts. In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions. I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay, but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saif''s hand instead of Akshay. Just from the starting point I expected of it, but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth. Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the midst. In any movie, the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit. And Tashan loses in this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a hit.<br /><br />Akshay's has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies. He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again. In between Saif did a great job in Race, and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie. But he has fully developed himself in the acting field. And last but not the least about Kareena. She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean. But I myself don't think so, instead she became slim. Yes slim!!! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people (or say, male). Beside them it is nice that Saif's son Ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young Saif. I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career.<br /><br />Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood, or say want to be admitted in an asylum. Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films. In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions.<br /><br />Sorry, I don't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies.	-9.481340356541159	-6.0556877505368805	-5.182691516028234	-5.127931271888861	-3.6193615312103864	-3.300721724761972	-2.8595643657777736	-1.4980532802272477	-1.3237028296236826	-0.35586041755131825	-0.2163260182821778	-0.033881163038602224	-0.03157301806051647	0.0575116183777684	0.552367473802846	1.2596101138671594	1.3022975750636836	1.3202765155224683	1.416769317521049	1.585630165613701	2.2838310177013814	2.5702265274856964	3.2688793619021657	6.49095904446908	12.303303917328332	
Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the R rating), there are very few things to like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings, but sadly, that's it. Poor plot. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are dismal. As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible. If we consider the action portions, well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan. This movie only contains the latter kind. This leaves little left. I'm so glad I did not pay for this.<br /><br />Despite any hype, I can read and think, so as I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but was somewhat worried going in. Yet, like a train wreck, one cannot merely look away. And even with no expectations, I was let down. Bad. Not even 'so bad, it's good' material. I'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but this makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar worthy.<br /><br />No, this piece of over CGI'd rubbish is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. How this is currently rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that I can think of as answers.<br /><br />I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight, I witnessed a train wreck. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 of 10	-11.200476760613025	-4.9083287058456	-3.6820267971990672	-3.5836866277626878	-3.2798909804333123	-2.9755715898483888	-2.8577674318722877	-1.7553960377017468	-1.1485824567913876	-1.105616282071171	-0.5597548548847365	0.04628631190828803	0.4645982886803478	0.5133747746097821	0.82004368379213	0.8879227937024382	0.9640692959655761	1.0366542092959539	1.126462712306274	1.1835784007653323	1.1975461382383883	1.825402947536832	4.182782268563391	5.261054669860191	11.563116124361132	
This Hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale. A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence. However, out of no where, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything--and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life! What an odd, silly and preachy film! Personally, I'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable!<br /><br />The production values are relatively poor compared to later productions--a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting.	-3.895470810881466	-2.1864464102018033	-2.178936623350381	-1.6891395414592605	-1.4926826016039676	-1.4867853424644157	-0.8290056589942172	-0.8275218026037537	-0.6085776421377163	-0.3708547077935487	-0.1731336839116358	-0.1400189151249634	0.018909667824113942	0.04048043115459518	0.11161665014159612	0.15261687129184137	0.1706456314929242	0.2860566855190625	0.404173031971303	0.5414542475352071	0.7758361648522724	0.7924125696663735	1.442837041741611	1.7453778523899144	4.340016205770186	
The performance by Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely, along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani. The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great. <br /><br />I have not seen another movie like this. It is one whole, each piece so nicely fit in the plot. You cannot not be impressed by this movie. <br /><br />Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty's at Sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning. Smita Patil does not play a main role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot. <br /><br />And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings. Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble. He is also the 'guru' of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.<br /><br />The movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody. Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /><br />A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.	-2.8450612231961108	-2.627095575164696	-2.3898220953317626	-1.8477826457471187	-1.6850824514271654	-0.8697486470839473	-0.8633993220580973	-0.7891912849145223	-0.6463879774527341	-0.3053441446927517	-0.14621342486867675	0.3779159289430872	0.48529597230141275	0.6080488503208065	0.9721724550322186	1.009835663834745	1.0285059926692541	1.0880201575722481	1.1538482940740789	1.173263386146617	1.271118971115147	1.6933943815915338	3.1369149225141006	3.5161244419798363	5.570947849415989	
This is not the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their parts well.	-1.1842694610476363	-1.1020392081292845	-1.094259059118987	-0.7688523100707247	-0.7365656763288815	-0.5894631460399891	-0.5278031118112553	-0.3630458172223263	-0.17857740576058656	-0.11109414022582852	-0.03614007121865577	-0.026604487438490115	0.03283063738805011	0.1003250675031973	0.21184130501947074	0.2590798281963981	0.2801796560364608	0.4703182515373453	0.6319879959224455	0.7023544977925023	0.7484639178240645	0.8549057340957846	1.483769433048733	1.5557938840352814	2.4125966080484447	
After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they go out house hunting. They manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh Sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. It just may be haunted.<br /><br />13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.<br /><br />The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening "thriller scene" features some wonky editing. Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action. Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy "fix it in the mix" techniques. There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow. The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked. As it stands, the scene has a strong "made for television" feel, and a low budget one at that.<br /><br />After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979), though the budget forces a much subtler approach. Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.<br /><br />For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.<br /><br />Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good. The performances help create tension. There isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. But neither menace is really the point.<br /><br />The point is human relationships. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. That it's in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with "normal" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.<br /><br />Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions. Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. It certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a DVD (that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it's worth a rental, and it's definitely worth watching for free.	-7.682732166441615	-5.9985242059217745	-5.633494627343561	-4.214166216539506	-2.7388763595718237	-2.442465767238972	-2.3204751618918196	-0.7258466997511293	-0.637539975166921	-0.11743424153512805	-0.022529035282451627	0.026019537100828993	0.14241931731057422	0.3209411962813179	0.869725285103405	0.9364333522483773	1.2871198824292318	1.4193301426501277	1.5792784672692128	2.181636132243023	2.8257717871031587	3.4442325623251526	5.331743487432297	6.221721000831758	12.876288563389924	
This was a favorite of my childhood - I can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time. Now that I'm grown up and have a kid of my own, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We watched it last Friday, and he liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine - he was genuinely scared. "Is he gonna beat the spider, Poppa?" Just watch, you'll see. He has no historical frame of reference to speak of (eight years old), so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid might as well be Oz under Ozma.<br /><br />I think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief, and not the grown-up king. In fact, if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys. <br /><br />It's definitely a period piece - I suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve, my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the Princess? Because the narrative demands it." The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless, love-struck deposed king is equally improbable. But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty-foot genies and the Temple of the All-Seeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu triumphantly flying away on his (stolen) magic carpet, seeking "some fun, and adventure at last!"	-3.0607851269005826	-2.6976331830585427	-2.2238102592419926	-1.9099699054053647	-1.19595726970757	-1.1416085141103132	-1.0611197230888956	-0.6751640579964592	-0.4381239801898379	-0.21950686461947763	0.020105501798611425	0.057941469030345305	0.07103071901222088	0.14809712673638728	0.14928367611992774	0.3934007360793704	0.41946498810248883	0.43056689532236503	0.5085957701993418	1.2063590862902789	1.4780180589935434	2.0503514311018303	2.057498906001977	2.938647875800626	5.493613990070449	
REnted this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely FANTASTIC! a wonderful movie, and one of my top three favorite of all time, i recommend it to Everyone!<br /><br />The story is enjoyable and easy to follow, this could have been easily messed up, but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together.<br /><br />The actors themselves are fantastic, displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job. <br /><br />Gotta find a copy somewhere...........	-2.36207448321926	-1.4076961694894476	-0.8851112891115506	-0.7463705554297033	-0.6411009753178853	-0.4020136574735198	-0.301123743100543	0.11799445091235411	0.13942784608214012	0.2840492498427301	0.38927651951365266	0.39948180025600766	0.5074689361207577	0.5158239385660575	0.5967461103023238	0.6361980219175525	0.9095125649386132	1.0751427237643554	1.2753605581444691	1.3049126188402727	1.3404334231583888	1.4180359217158598	1.8748967750686683	2.261146529437461	2.5267848068555074	
Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made...ever?' It is Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are lots of famously bad movies, but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously.<br /><br />It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again.<br /><br />It was released only on video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling.	-3.7876384681265924	-2.2623858063828832	-1.9836335963749117	-1.8657304073529963	-1.8590233032082413	-1.7648295193461294	-1.230454351394222	-0.4056736083413383	-0.3404481155485728	-0.13845761050302022	-0.0057957699522948325	-0.005579779831221349	0.06669549260116067	0.12951213596150654	0.1352023666394857	0.2685216923424788	0.3886654308666666	0.4642330782628289	0.5425335245538858	0.6415027076148802	0.7304999057914634	0.805568875178331	1.2967377830872855	2.73127757877165	4.458708908165563	
I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was. The school play where the leading actors kiss, that happened at my school. A crazy gang of lads, my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke! 'Getting the whack', some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes! after that they were kept in a safe!!! And as for certain nocternal activities! what can I say.... The film actually came out in 1982, I remember that as it was when I bought my house and the film was showing at the same time. If you like British films and films about school, growing up and period pieces, then this is for you. Another film very much like it, 'SWALK', came out a few years before and I for one would like to see that again, also 'Kes' is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But trust me, 1982 is when it came out)	-1.8093568825282067	-1.5032539565197223	-1.4410188711493415	-0.7890280397185212	-0.5134128726895236	-0.3995873620742316	-0.3313347399731468	-0.29975664124030293	-0.2911085723818487	-0.18540982919947044	-0.07250575865827033	-0.02511886114897489	-0.016054332955054866	0.07519796267028137	0.10307902254136095	0.1512229376037528	0.34845961520041624	0.452119971790419	0.5642215924986047	0.5689402278922113	0.5890713768684442	1.0260463758289546	1.0624807084486827	1.4949303454385505	2.305264461223558	
This, the direct-to-video death rattle of the Tremors series, features sixty inspired seconds (sawblade: you'll know it when you see it) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at. Tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget. That means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence, tops. The lackluster, cliche-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the Tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long. Only hardcore Tremors fans will be able to sit through, much less enjoy this film. If you aren't among them- don't bother.	-2.8740315023231995	-1.1460360018310929	-1.1299849320466093	-0.9709790029031475	-0.9177399554656789	-0.906156022099354	-0.9049240653908506	-0.41155271483348677	-0.3605312635684663	-0.10174209980502144	-0.10040259854246827	-0.08234243874729506	-0.031335786410749696	0.14894031471371735	0.2084431725344619	0.23444878349849585	0.26335338134956304	0.3129865706127132	0.3307413527181793	0.42066575399184325	0.4594135527097546	0.5548589666933537	1.2254680863347658	1.3634684485388326	3.025611349290629	
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It's hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. Supposedly set in the 70s, there is scant attention paid to period details, with overly muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location, the bleachers. It seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film, which is a complete waste of time.	-3.7787978966461875	-1.6223875704934723	-1.4387487862855899	-1.378487972272016	-1.372940480606181	-1.246874231487453	-1.1600543483716221	-0.3590586040358199	-0.24840236452449796	-0.23276699900177006	-0.1754463669312965	-0.15314920462228254	-0.03502364637860274	0.07163847656497709	0.10582446339901201	0.1479055642503682	0.2419206496941671	0.24797163259719143	0.3043095566175017	0.3990641854617855	0.4484211221371205	0.641663049898473	1.7317235205683454	1.9907816792108157	3.8594869192660024	
I saw this movie the day it opened in NYC, at the Ziegfield. At the time Madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now. She had a couple of hits, was very good in "Desparately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her in concert at Giants Stadium. <br /><br />"Who's That Girl?" gives Madonna an actual role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She does the madcap/heroine routine better than you might think. Griffin Dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans.<br /><br />The story involves a huge cat named Murray, a bride-to-be who has slept with every cabbie in NYC, a mean father-in-law, and a key. There are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path. All the elements of a screwball comedy intact. <br /><br />Sir John Mills is seen briefly. He shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with a rain forest and everything. <br /><br />Compared to most Madonna movies (the ones I've been able to tolerate anyway), this is fantastic. On its own, its not that bad. 6/10.<br /><br />PS The concert was lousy.	-3.2506329633800126	-2.271309993318389	-2.063856709783965	-1.7738030742605733	-1.2110916522975415	-0.712064733330944	-0.29989099463919133	-0.1974070195904741	-0.12623697626942862	-0.05425547162621419	0.003856672358099611	0.03262596364704647	0.03660994803370536	0.37406084209632945	0.3891824793669775	0.4354174680539053	0.49101078433614737	0.6162792250255057	0.6602067846885639	0.6670361146696548	1.2969168068727548	1.7460180803838692	2.472667244998788	3.119999098786242	4.803144890115866	
Wow, I just saw this on T.V. as one of the "scary" movies they show around Halloween. Was this rated G? There wasn't really anything to make this movie scary, or worth watching. Also, other people say this is a spoof, but I don't think so. For a spoof, you need something called "humor". This low-budget crap-fest didn't have a shred of humor, and it didn't make much sense, either. You basically have a goofy looking monster (man in rubber suit) coming out of closets, killing people, I guess, since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess that's good enough.<br /><br />The military tries feebly to kill the monster, which isn't much larger than a man. They have very bad aim. Then the military FLEES! Wow, did this movie make the U.S. military look pathetic or what? The monster, while hard to kill, doesn't do much besides shuffle around and roar. Oh, and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks. It was a slightly interesting, yet a total Alien ripoff.<br /><br />What was the deal with the scientist playing the Xylophone to attract the monster? It was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long? Why didn't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless?	-8.09237304917986	-3.3541362620429775	-2.9544213155203516	-2.750089784345986	-2.6572788396951226	-2.3915730967315665	-1.9446018521670654	-1.1800656913333132	-1.0536959404052297	-0.5706992680947401	-0.4318374927175691	0.382792647154911	0.552201735142196	0.5610023852695634	0.6552658778260849	0.6649490072868417	0.6903981987743056	0.7504866085109185	0.7893140360364801	0.7896507902957811	0.8841827977570362	1.7512234237121649	3.4949318865236294	3.8941058596933185	9.061967087337925	
Couldn't go to sleep the other night. So I got up, flipped on the tube & this movie was on.<br /><br />Film makers bit off more than they could chew. Just as ambitious in scope as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump read like an fairy-tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era. TGMB just relies on tired clichés to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to ham it up. Every character's purpose was to fill a silly 60's archetype.<br /><br />Take how we're introduced to Finnegan: Hugging his black maid & receiving a framed picture of MLK. Criminey, talk about heavy-handed. Why not just give him a t-shirt saying "I Heart Black People"?<br /><br />Sunshine: "Isn't free love groovay, man? Oh no, I didn't have my period." <br /><br />Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCLA." Uh, excuse me? There was nothing square about LA in the 60s. Rather than take the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just hear this brat whine about not going there.<br /><br />Can't even remember the black kid's name. He was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are.<br /><br />Thing is, period pieces don't have to be this cheesy. Take "Dazed & Confused." Look how we're introduced to the football hero, Randall Floyd. We don't first see him on the football field. In fact, we never see him play football. We're introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party.<br /><br />In "Dazed" feminism isn't a casual by-product of some chick getting knocked up. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It's refined in the ladies' room over a flip discussion about Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings. But real life is like that.<br /><br />Some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant. I agree! Which is why I feel so disappointed by this piece of Baby-Boomer pornostalgia.	-11.167549262954207	-5.9236537755309575	-4.087194166659925	-3.996843794829191	-3.3945173658594885	-3.219424065946092	-2.9549125634082256	-2.930758077033353	-1.2816817650347494	-0.7255035026293062	-0.361013630773504	0.08575875468836955	0.24644279655973192	0.4134940776986769	0.9666228620393524	1.0208759798032232	1.5302597550494317	1.6379672068683253	1.9604476537706879	1.9946780466674048	2.06847663252009	2.3463832148994572	2.8082119592606247	5.797908468399976	12.596384489445791	
It's reassuring to see that other IMDb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film, at the risk of blaspheming against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini.<br /><br />These directors may be talented & artistic in their own right; however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60s chic as *in any way* related to Edgar Allen Poe's stories, they exposed themselves as frauds. Either (A) they didn't bother to read the Poe stories, or (B) they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn't pay Poe any mind.<br /><br />Imagine if Metallica plugged in their guitars, cranked the amps up to 11 and moshed out 3 chords claiming it to be Beethoven's 9th Symphony. That's the feeling you'll get after sitting through this film. If you're a Vadim/Malle/Fellini fan (Metallica), you'll dig it. If you're a Beethoven fan (Poe), you'll puke.<br /><br />METZERGENSTEIN...<br /><br />Here we begin with a bizarre porno version of Poe. OK, "porno" may be a bit extreme haha, but at the very least you have to call it a Barbarella version (including, I don't doubt, some of Jane's outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp). Vadim falls into old clichés of his own: the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow-cam we see the apathy in her eyes; the general lassitude and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Cute stuff, but "Metzergenstein" ain't the place for it. And in addition to the Barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, Jane Fonda's awful American accent and unconvincing performance as a European countess made this the worst casting since Julia Roberts in that lousy version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.<br /><br />WILLIAM Wilson...<br /><br />Here's a great Poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, go watch Star Trek episode #27 "The Alternative Factor". But here, Malle glazes over that central theme and instead focuses on... any guesses...? yup, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum. Brigitte Bardot's role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end, and once again the director distorts a classic Poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues. Do it on your own time, Malle. I thought we're here on Poe's dime.<br /><br />TOBY DAMMIT....<br /><br />The absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film I've seen since "Staying Alive". At least Fellini showed some tact in changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humour of the story is so vast, I wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies, stamped "Edgar Allen Poe story" on it and submitted it to this collection. I strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with Poe's works, but there was absolutely none.<br /><br />The original Poe story ("Never Bet the Devil Your Head") is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims "I'll bet the devil my head..." On a foggy morning, the devil takes him up on his offer. The result is the sickest and silliest thing you've ever read. This was Poe, the comedian, at his finest (yes, Poe wrote many comedies. Also check out "A Predicament" and "Devil in the Belfry" if you want a taste of his witty, satirical works).<br /><br />This Fellini version? It's bland, soulless, and not funny at all (unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes). Here Fellini's egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. Most of it is set at an awards ceremony where Fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm, cynicism and that classic "sour grapes" attitude that we find in all Fellini films dealing with cinema. Note the sarcastic jabs at "the critics", a recurring theme in Fellini's films. For someone who considered himself above the critics, Fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them. At any rate, I feel like Fellini just took some outtakes from 8 1/2, spliced them together and sold it as a Poe story. Worst "adaptation" ever.<br /><br />I think I put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a Poe movie.	-16.706346395241525	-8.404431448948674	-7.17740132137061	-7.164851324631188	-6.458289175356844	-4.276705004451663	-2.2949993467366605	-1.6264432565640887	-1.626431888763449	-1.3674113251718987	-1.3560504700665776	-0.8226179176823436	-0.2320429205892627	0.1499473176187903	0.5201464980318785	0.7358232380549028	1.128923294475656	1.783881309304827	2.498924345801352	2.5022099408303022	2.7630754415464227	2.9252405566192876	4.57139820748337	9.394926536668006	17.373146163483902	
This film is the best film Jim Carrey has ever made. Carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film. He was both funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God(Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then, God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as supporting actor/actress. The plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point. This movie can be funny(Bruce's dog) as well as sad(the "break-up"). The script worked well, too. I am glad they made a sequel to this film. I rate this film a 9/10.	-3.7228125368422735	-3.3852527724377457	-2.136444161973603	-1.4425999910868421	-0.7561395014615356	-0.6648523934898164	-0.34195444130295327	-0.1996117240948717	-0.04575738266627434	0.0658629727335835	0.08580893821620993	0.15832529198302892	0.18990378395573027	0.302329285673012	0.43087657505290117	0.501611842498153	0.7737800812291984	0.8829442627218704	1.350371080676324	1.4341881723989334	1.4924373006183456	1.7564690496363913	2.8297614989290047	3.0808044727218764	4.344885247019249	
The first and second seasons started off shakily, with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones, and at times resorting to clichéd stories. But once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it's characters more, it became a lot more fun and entertaining. <br /><br />The main reason this show succeeds it because of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humour makes to show so much better, Peter's directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining, and Joe & Paul never fail to make a funny, interesting episode together. <br /><br />Once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters, I doubt you won't like the show. For those getting into the show I suggest the episodes 'The Other Side', a good serious episode, and 'Window of Opportunity', a classic comic relief episode.	-2.0112018933070415	-1.2015577164603422	-0.9994225103044543	-0.8747505916605622	-0.474124187317558	-0.4330103447951888	-0.2089088611466813	-0.15331638168656891	-0.10559025046736933	0.07478687345908652	0.17044555180604565	0.19464247935250234	0.22936035435880198	0.2459771678218277	0.276344512223184	0.4746085246332845	0.4799153377204688	0.48960437615583313	0.5122876052845458	0.771270869910956	0.8850026542497964	1.0676677201832578	1.6065476844326632	1.9232188691416066	2.2090082766942087	
I saw this movie previewed before something else I rented a while back...and it looked decent. I've seen some good stuff from Full Moon video, and thought it was worth a shot... Unfortunately, this was not good stuff.<br /><br />The story is about a possessed bed. A couple moves into a new apartment, discovers the bed, and odd things start happening. Odd things like the woman discovers kinky sex. And the man discovers kinky sex. And the woman draws pictures of kinky sex. And the man photographs kinky sex. And they both start having dreams about dead people having kinky sex. You'd think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good, right?<br /><br />Well.... No. The problem is that this is supposed to be a scary movie, or at least a thriller, and it just doesn't deliver. There is little tension, no suspense, and no fear. Aside from some troubling dreams and visions, there really isn't anything for this couple to be worried about. The whole movie is basically the two of them having these visions and playing around in bed. Sure, you get a monster fight at the end...and some bloodshed...but nothing spectacular... There's only one murder, and one good scare, and that's it.<br /><br />And the kinky sex? Don't get your hopes up (or anything else for that matter). Their idea of kinky sex is woman on top, fully clothed, trying to strangle her mate with a necktie. Not exactly my idea of a good time.	-5.892975723581249	-3.791569682399988	-3.550748711365675	-2.676019110937577	-2.2213072614025267	-2.1112213408554092	-1.4666713425450904	-1.4165255168829356	-1.1867344552345014	-0.7026299987941415	-0.01677429928905344	0.10630538873174115	0.1947702206053818	0.27918178378685005	0.4220312289634307	0.4259305024614267	0.6884030365601634	0.9910241305745571	1.012371738599803	1.187079710999033	1.5046212978428575	1.6670770396436974	1.8683525451070155	3.1105190602787713	6.587560573295568	
Brain of Blood starts as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley) the leader of a country called Kahlid is close to death because of cancer, however if he dies Kahlid will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) & one of Amir's devotees Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) have devised a plan to take Amir's dead body to America where mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain into a fresh body & with a bit of plastic surgery no-one will ever know he was even dead. Things don't go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant Amir's brain Trenton's freak assistant Gor (John Bloom) brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony, Trenton needed a strong fit living body & since there's no more time he decides to use Gor's body as a temporary stop-gap until another more suitable one can be found. Unfortunately when Amir wakes up in his new body he's not very happy at what he sees, I mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak?<br /><br />Also known as Brain Damage, The Brain, The Creature's Revenege & The Undying Brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced & directed by the one & only Al Adamason & quite frankly I'm offended at the pathetic 1.5 rating Brain of Blood has on the IMDb, personally I think it's terrific fun in a so bad it's good sort of way. The highly entertaining script by Kane W. Lynn & Joe Van Rodgers is as loopy & silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists, from 7 foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to 4 foot tall midget medical assistant's, from basement dungeons to rooftop chases, from car crashes to assassination's, kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women, from Regina Carrol's hair-do which should get it's own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh-out-loud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech! It's all here & Brain of Blood has quality cheese stamped all over it, if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of 'must see' films. Despite it's lowly 1.5 rating I am proud to admit that I liked Brain of Blood a lot, I thought it was an absolute hoot to watch, it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket, at only 85 minutes it's relatively short, it's difficult to second guess the barmy plot & I just think it's loads of campy fun.<br /><br />This is director Adamson's masterpiece as far as I'm concerned along with Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971) which he made a year before this. Those who have seen an Adamson film before will know about the none existent production values, cheap special effects & cardboard sets & that all adds to the fun, this film manages that fine between incompetence & seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience. I love the opening shot of Kahlid which is obviously just a photo of the Taj Mahal in India complete with statuesque people in the foreground! Regina Carrol's hair seems to be a separate entity on it's own, it seems to change styles between shots & is frankly horrendous, don't get me started about her make-up job either that she must apply with a a paint sprayer! There is another hilarious moment when we see Amir's body has been transported to America wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil, why is the question I asked myself, why!? The effects are variable, there's a terrible looking fake spider, Gor's burned make-up job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressive.<br /><br />The budget for Brain of Blood must have been practically none existent, I must admit I thought Trenton's lab was quite good with various computers & medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap & nasty. The production values are low, the music was taken from another film Beast of Blood (1971) & the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way.<br /><br />Brain of Blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever & as far as I'm concerned it's a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that I had a great time watching & laughing at. They just don't/can't/won't make them like this anymore, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it. I liked it, but then again I'm just weird.	-6.905042232227383	-4.278198773997071	-3.890131213727703	-3.864717541365277	-3.493706207578457	-2.6248926899413743	-1.6394347087285712	-1.2613083732408112	-0.5543952646433166	-0.4028625000177166	-0.3159783154441236	-0.1959708963305601	-0.13479543444308342	0.4461811046088633	0.4596174023030971	0.624844433399321	0.671974175069269	0.8496313650921336	0.968982446807567	1.2175181957487284	1.2698828071142614	1.723302087108527	1.7930572921190193	4.7505979097651965	8.886335269823716	
One of the most heart-warming foreign films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The young girl is an amazing talent. Stellar performances by her (Doggie), the old man (the king of masks), and Liang (the Living Boddhisatva).<br /><br />(SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially females is disturbing.<br /><br />Loved the music. The original Chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.<br /><br />This is a MUST SEE -- enjoyable family film, although not for very young children. Would have rated the DVD release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the DVD and the transfer had included the widescreen version.	-2.185579728947518	-1.215193644402633	-0.9396739337954897	-0.7131566231909147	-0.49849933058566687	-0.4575102282897663	-0.0848023005870144	-0.055089728272794375	-0.04110607702541582	0.09613842524322289	0.11969155104260532	0.13584512542487237	0.30623762472623406	0.31301214306617825	0.4369177248225031	0.5026486176710898	0.5910007382211674	0.6342543622937948	0.6684965080537847	0.75165804912523	0.837375505821303	0.8536004136822185	1.4416236354288077	1.9940710641084127	2.0501855597527263	
I'm normally not a Drama/Feel good movie kind of guy, but once I saw the trailer for "Radio", I couldn't resist. Not only is this a great film, but it also has grreat acting. Cuba Gooding Jr. did an excellent job portraying James Robert Kennedy, a.k.a. "RAdio." Ed Harris also did a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well. So for a great story, great acting, and a little comedy, I give "Radio" a 10 out of 10!	-2.7248649928293727	-2.59926057244047	-1.1436500484505303	-0.765275778350674	-0.7149489909896942	-0.4148657466791646	-0.0650042421841774	-0.06033246366269498	-0.004166818742054441	0.07436854067542054	0.1529530054562283	0.1984120185271968	0.273368112934919	0.3142784180111017	0.4085068158802576	0.5470086555184188	0.5587490028927244	0.6302580279769139	0.6649666441535279	0.7102589401247585	1.0809342722039288	1.0905104318463104	1.398297234678867	1.577843350690673	2.582487294875995	
This was the beginning of it all! Granted, this is not Friends at its best, but this was the show's pilot, let's not forget and not a bad one at that. We're introduced to the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode we get a sign of the Ross-Rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years, when Ross says: 'I just want to be married again' and Rachel storms in with a wedding dress on... probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a Monica-Joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back. Something else.. in this episode Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes, the so-called 'flashbacks' this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions. Nevertheless, the point is this a fine start to a great show. This episode may not be the usual Friends as we are accustomed to them, with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was!

When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood...<br /><br />Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded! <br /><br />With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(Jess) and the world around him(Donna).<br /><br />As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.<br /><br />It's to bad that most people will avoid this film. I only say that because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role? That didn't work before!" PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.<br /><br />Oh and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in. He has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence. It's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!<br /><br />S~	-2.4576679127400003	-2.0875989991853827	-1.8809029760975682	-1.4081874574151725	-1.2085037000215986	-0.6856945434548365	-0.2783577105142476	-0.2744463329128515	-0.2703829287487918	-0.189683194640581	-0.15684093205130015	-0.12490281474023687	0.09201609563081942	0.19347315942973065	0.20200485242435798	0.3982264143237177	0.6076171334921429	0.7725884470728589	0.921358641886881	0.941536098922189	1.056882377244537	1.1813508784142122	1.849603553782158	2.879731560532485	3.931807830208553	
When I was in 7th grade(back in 1977), I was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my English class studies. I can remember being very touched by it and excited when a TV version came out a year later.<br /><br />Kristy McNichol was a popular TV actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit TV series "Family". It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part. I recall her as being a bit "stiff" at times, but over all she does a good job. She carries the movie well.<br /><br />Esther Rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her. Barbara Barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good, as is young Robin Lively (who would eventually appear as the black widow Lana Milford in "Twin Peaks")as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parent's affection. Bruce Davidson is also appropriately appealing as the German soldier of the title<br /><br />The best performance, however, belongs to Michael Constantine. It is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time. The bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch, but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter. Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.<br /><br />The film differs from the book only in some small ways. It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.<br /><br />	-5.668982358835694	-3.2469313097660195	-1.9239971882211515	-1.8584557647720452	-1.7129322750671732	-0.6563506567206783	-0.35213898903284685	0.3283013218458018	0.3789342426009947	0.6167263360288817	1.0771720963322873	1.0991956295301493	1.226005907028146	1.3117009079718223	1.3593497738700022	1.4442552265287858	1.536768175045759	1.603322183024028	1.8020619615719868	1.8060691303613883	2.2945684566226348	2.5450248417605676	3.1216763681791213	3.180455741139917	5.704025520658102	
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. It's dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.<br /><br />I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn't any. The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.<br /><br />The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are least cheap. Though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna.<br /><br />This film is so dreadful, it should have a public health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I took it back, of people demanding their money back. I kid you not!	-7.737442163891827	-3.4537713048629493	-3.387445129125534	-3.224454634138577	-2.971848675493436	-2.5115879373071524	-1.5085454725112404	-0.6978808538305592	-0.6330717258617292	-0.6074342041241249	-0.4722497790386006	-0.3342572938467647	-0.1455970239034709	0.1877954472076271	0.4035088106000635	0.456692043789296	0.5683162106426448	0.663436652279961	0.7867841134605438	0.86041197643746	0.8934419478122715	1.043195146605457	3.9412613654159503	4.107747123402253	7.899035767889108	
This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.	-2.7757668930469546	-1.6169804202637976	-1.6168057126981306	-1.5880600624973698	-1.3142592076436064	-0.4323664653248275	-0.4280920035394088	-0.4180303888868143	-0.3843979254308403	-0.35018337651237613	-0.34998959181545947	-0.08869513264780221	0.06137592130305481	0.12605347659341934	0.153500786694176	0.16124515626461078	0.22445033103692277	0.2260527980563024	0.278924627553331	0.3658578978530047	0.6496701843625534	0.7592406464909607	0.8027388642669026	1.517848999771148	2.926763333122343	
This movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to Casablanca but Paul Lukas beat out Humphrey Bogart for best actor. I don't see why Lucile Watson was nominated for best supporting actor, i just don't think she did a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three kids are leaving Mexico and coming into the United States in the first scene of the movie. They are going by train to Davis's relatives house. Davis and Lukas were in the underground to stop the Nazis so they are very tired and need rest. But when they arrive home, their is a Nazi living there and their's not much either can do about it. It turns out the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with Lukas. Their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself.	-3.078649232066426	-1.3072551538524118	-1.2163386101359983	-1.0396825796109712	-1.0217090910669169	-0.9844521265687025	-0.8583114130002252	-0.41158458451710356	-0.39458998559125374	-0.3067886690453864	-0.03479353841765508	0.037096280436544685	0.04906513836926836	0.15462167597621898	0.1972250927929509	0.19947151983590405	0.21017886399595503	0.23962992686624923	0.2601225809535101	0.2737687032380156	0.44192936398058147	0.7593655506746028	1.230372258906332	1.2516534025365733	3.269413143499031	
I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this one, it looks pretty good! You've got Decapitron, the puppets, and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk that's doing this project to animate, inanimate objects, can't act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I'd watch that for 2 hours. But instead, the puppets role is down played, and the whole movie suffered because of it. The mystical Skull guy who created the totem is corny at best, and Decapitrons appearance is long awaited, short, and really quite disappointing. You'd be better off watching the first one again.	-6.148177909362404	-3.3166409931231056	-3.130771956491134	-3.1024615129009367	-2.752980113138334	-2.033039244455874	-1.5383506367252346	-0.8822770934678901	-0.5490412147409495	-0.1379543053037613	-0.13659165122009767	-0.09636041508930383	-0.044819285098724904	0.12277609828657368	0.35429616326395696	0.36293950709679235	0.6590759730908701	0.7777243596316626	0.8204311665485109	0.9031185251184158	1.0470621526121036	1.250150654768118	1.8611222415414779	4.166550705074609	7.347371868700284	
I do not know what today's movie goers expect, but after 68 years of movie watching.. (Well maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make that 58 years of movie watching) I expect to be entertained, not bored to tears, assaulted by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled. Surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have NO imagination, little if any talent, a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on, long after the purpose for it has elapsed. That anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie, when it is nothing more that Hollywood garbage is beyond me. As a combat veteran I have seen violence, blood and gore, in many forms, and movies like We were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get, but it has redeeming value. Surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor, with no writing ability, no directorial training, no experience in film editing, and a total lack of contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents, setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops, etc.. A high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like...	-5.192680682901185	-2.8167396281731896	-2.6195438414766543	-2.3595892372124347	-2.1055445670252104	-1.0191941834569382	-0.8811324466699328	-0.868689584288344	-0.7678526146273459	-0.6652264591330563	-0.45441370088456123	-0.2736428946817824	-0.21624328155428033	-0.10299682076098514	-0.03536875893417159	0.13450514474394565	0.2000836771061839	0.20729605760870662	0.23144901448455546	0.5519647015510374	0.8575003798980161	0.8850315939589999	1.8603608775559486	2.690689363744206	4.984304318743974	
I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of ROLL.<br /><br />Roll is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone) who has dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat gets dragged into George's world. <br /><br />I thought it was great how Mat teaches George some morals and respect while George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.<br /><br />Every character in the movie complimented each other very well, the two cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. Tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters 'Pando' from Two Hands.<br /><br />One of the other things that I liked about Roll was that it showcased the cities that I grew up and lived in for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see sights and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel.<br /><br />This Rocks 'n' Rolls	-1.9885655635666548	-1.9279848307896086	-1.433946305969189	-1.3725854107054352	-1.2314111482553758	-0.43323191310420284	-0.3603601464117779	-0.3565099272702511	-0.08945290054586771	-0.08605667684767049	-0.06840785798936719	0.021160449765456134	0.09117439349136817	0.15141420483877993	0.24713188035141426	0.615432196585634	0.6564429573324304	1.0136468792500513	1.057136979078376	1.0599402212595916	1.1565642894154702	1.262712424613397	2.2328693401226247	3.104486077216321	3.5180822397970846	
OK so I hear about this new Justin Timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names. I mean great actors like, The Freeman aka Morgan Freeman, an asset to Hollywood, however completely wasted in this film. Then we got Kevin Spacey, who I've been a great fan of ever since I watched American Beauty and The Usual Suspects. Both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as I did when I heard the story. Then enter a fresh faced Justin Timberlake. I say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven't hit him yet. Well the reason for that , I might add, is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review. The movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it. The characters were so one dimensional that it makes some Bible characters look like the Don Corleone. They got the one liners and sound-bite worthy stuff. The token troubled black guy (LL COOL J) who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life. The captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone. And what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience. Oh and lots of gun fire, i mean a whole lot. SPOILER(NOT!!!) THe kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who's crooked dead and the hero prevails. They got flame throwers and rocket launchers, REally no kidding.<br /><br />Bottom line if you want to see Edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors, or a great fan of Justin Timberlake, to all the 13 year old girls out there, enjoy!! I wish i had more hands, because then I would have more thumbs, because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening.<br /><br />MAY G*D HAVE MERCY ON US ALL and save us from these terrible movies. Well it could be worst, another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher, hehe check out IN THE MIX lol, or even Get rich or die trying'. Now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30+ year old men, playing 16 or even younger teens. I could go on with these.	-7.3357432581431805	-4.811942620889152	-4.731046486609695	-3.910440101542041	-3.120435554587371	-2.660387347124391	-2.4219301399374187	-0.8687767070852409	-0.1483033524883343	-0.05735250305462076	-0.030523314542130503	-0.028609103107056458	0.24735782567416417	0.46953915967502535	0.4917332106398777	0.5424518472185978	0.5807887796699178	0.6860229477680586	1.1796799540599034	1.3095590546741447	1.8737939462199256	2.207580009531779	2.9207259411540063	5.451636753381576	9.921701940975893	
This movie was release when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed.<br /><br />That was over 24 years ago and I haven't seen the movie since. This time around I cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is.<br /><br />Life is not always fair and the good guys don't always win in fact I think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls. Also it doesn't matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you. Girls/boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise. Sometimes you just gotta let go and say next.<br /><br />Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone.<br /><br />I remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics. The acting is not quite there compared with Fast Times at Ridgemount High but it kicks ass over this movie simply because FTARH has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending. Nice guys finish last!! Gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive. We all know a David, fun guy who makes you laugh.<br /><br />Some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them, especially at that age. I have experienced that first hand.<br /><br />Great sound track too!!

Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. While decent in plucky, self-effacing roles, Ms. Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed 2, 28 Days) leave much to be desired. Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused, and sexually maladjusted (the sub-plot of Sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character). The two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream "We did it!" Chris Penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's token partner/love interest character.<br /><br />***Spoilers Ahead*** Mediocre acting aside, the biggest flaws can be traced to a TV-of-the-week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place, and as mentioned, the stupid errors (vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene, an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor, the two boys hanging out together in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc. etc) cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers. The ending was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. Using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way. * out of ****.	-5.860645637607356	-3.306640284002081	-2.923263908776334	-2.4934523418179895	-2.4490892832018054	-1.5353784704116091	-1.476413937012267	-0.7653445973618824	-0.7568887603179231	-0.42131881043705166	-0.3172582544956867	-0.14021030931501488	-0.03569727127939229	0.0265392320353878	0.07415662973051212	0.2734217445977588	0.41347600000615764	0.43729236162089613	0.5404822692575992	0.9000406236761178	1.1933247380733434	1.3987449001853245	2.4781605001201252	3.165878273110925	6.182285677320486	
If any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills, this is probably the one. I've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way, but having a strong feeling. The movie was disturbing at moments. However, the movie was terrible at editing. The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place. Like Karisma is getting beat up, and the same time SRK is fighting (comically) with the police officers. The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place. On top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning. The direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.<br /><br />I have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely. Without them, this movie would not have an impact. Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza. She looks pretty in the first half, and I've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her. What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date. Nana Patekar was excellent as her father-in-law. Not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him. Deepti Naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene. Though she doesn't have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good. The other good performance was the little kid. He was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes. The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances. Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do. Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. <br /><br />One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina. The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song. And boy Aish is mad hot. However, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever. People may have come to the movie for Aish, but they won't brag too much about it after-wards. Hum Tum Miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie. Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about. Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie. Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.	-9.770286009917163	-6.271122601557169	-5.572094950595106	-4.228512898786795	-3.7510272168945993	-3.4283810762109024	-2.818639717881482	-1.0837147806798395	-0.7354403321299794	-0.5956109844933369	-0.34100207322916964	-0.20995991476788228	0.19044038979681233	0.48214266922779914	0.5407405777391707	1.0808843581574916	1.1354502472697552	1.236574446363875	1.251088971302634	2.1920132446314686	3.1483600579823117	3.802366764318792	3.8227670807566247	6.867602060422941	13.88124674766164	
Dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS!!! Also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. Due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. No one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. This should be a crime and.... I cant believe you would ruin a book like that. I thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed!!!! It totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it. Your just making it a big joke.	-5.06198934665799	-2.204642986094024	-1.9813903151226762	-1.9303334449096397	-1.9145078812965164	-1.8890060217636944	-1.749735559296012	-0.30922787510095984	-0.23206978922965307	-0.21973407256995955	-0.07896042938072066	-0.05381056946939673	-0.03530935649786164	0.019029541298422964	0.027661393752021278	0.18313452379006762	0.2629796864504123	0.26553978717374344	0.3367965733954042	0.501922508221871	0.7336491408046496	0.797739293891403	2.143238791409274	2.4780431397765486	5.24200979819484	
Don't know what film or version Jeff saw, but this entire film was awesome, not just Poitier and Going. The story was riveting, suspenseful and engaging. And for the guy complaining about historical accuracy, get real. Yes there were some Black deputy marshals in the Indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest Whites outside of Indian territory. As a rule, they did not "patrol" but exercised warrants on criminals only. I did find it odd that Corby didn't seem to have "any' Indian friends. I know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange. Even as Corby returned to his people, his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.	-2.862844427198108	-1.6250812865188278	-1.4890739975963578	-1.248424963348794	-0.9375804242698248	-0.9182566437625237	-0.39301245962206705	-0.3659361393405916	-0.33599664181365374	-0.17868997633908557	-0.17304703887073009	0.0633446699657632	0.18224102904296907	0.20222429849143553	0.2638151084872826	0.26760386087548016	0.30286556325612446	0.38785300582870585	0.5459285006366401	0.662740278962298	0.6660401706483899	0.7820995479088656	0.8627461714801458	1.950623583632835	3.8434284494632642	
I really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites. It's not preachy, it's not anchored by it's moral, it shouldn't be controversial. It's just God. Any possible God, no matter the religion. And it's really funny.<br /><br />Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself (more or less TO himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job. This drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. When the final straws are executed, he's quick to not laugh, but yell in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he's guilted into helping others, where he then continues to miss the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground.<br /><br />OK, that was kinda long. But as a plot, it works well. The step-by-step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems together, and is able to hide itself fairly well.<br /><br />As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carrey's pitch-perfect acting stays in character (which, luckily enough, is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution. And the humour is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, it would kinda feel like a It's a Wonderful Life wannabe.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. At least, you don't think that when you see her. She gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple.<br /><br />The movie feels ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carrey's career (which wasn't goin' anywhere.).	-5.280605437462754	-4.63376015890706	-3.99165395184474	-3.30347609137985	-1.9768096974071505	-1.6259383315348919	-1.5240062279744422	-0.8494650516166198	-0.6332944053700711	-0.5901938968279467	-0.4470714488915216	-0.2948787275865104	0.38654815350408955	0.6206571128512106	0.6718549152189414	0.696705411800641	0.9895114159724543	1.0946922797839087	1.2043455744468825	1.2837686433804874	1.291505812962008	1.8574597068895313	3.3565566375950096	5.200470631663245	8.71707045204141	
I was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue, but was pleased to find a fast-paced script, an underlying moral, excellent portrayals from all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense, and beautiful cinematography--there's even a shot of the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work. All the supporting players round it out, and I do wonder who trained all those elephants.<br /><br />Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence, you really can discern that it's Vivien Leigh in the long shots. Her shape and the way she moves is distinct from Taylor's. The only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots, where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk.<br /><br />If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.	-1.2796245178173162	-1.2697651029682697	-0.89912165986287	-0.8114061234003473	-0.582455976230384	-0.4785050487876856	-0.43789629188957646	-0.4335878741069102	-0.3796274756953378	-0.2541503929599278	-0.24987049105908676	-0.08740671909838292	-0.06137834792732703	-0.058658517464131144	-0.05682399494825485	-0.04770922096211531	-0.008385412181657434	-0.0019355983248134112	0.4437723160950574	0.518947668998506	0.6770098322631436	0.8216325142077083	1.0002302500760638	1.04832435560958	1.6789198225959672	
I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is ok. It's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1, (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I wasn't expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest. Antonio Sabato Jr. is some kind of biologist or scientist or something, I wasn't really paying attention. He goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course. By the way, all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. First of all, if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station, what's with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff. Are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident. The shark theory was advanced by Antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against. Antonio and this young college student, horrible actress by the way, just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble. What is with that? Unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school I find this a little silly. The director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background. Metal crafting is very important when your on a sub I guess. Anyway I could go on but I've said too much already. Bottom Line: Go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. Then send email asking IMDB to remove all record of this movie from their site. All memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. We can do it if we work together.	-9.94093146333482	-4.702249217387549	-3.4878467459813653	-3.265054974660871	-3.0823429741130255	-3.065663801939539	-2.5671772674126707	-1.5652194669476205	-1.3049439446663553	-1.1168673175224793	-0.6394468695975655	-0.05400405555095292	0.2861707738785196	0.3030531087865576	0.5353171390526112	0.5903486958126893	1.118671826769434	1.1215576116163377	1.3125889559978283	1.4166787863579975	1.4618659317303924	2.4414626138618525	3.5120996810651763	4.874234595105773	10.51962164198684	
So here's a bit of background on how I came to see this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, that was then remade (quelle surprise) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well I avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because, a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and living in Chicago, I didn't see why they called it that - it was filmed in fricking Canada for a start! - b) I have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes, done purely because Hollywood thinks we're too bone idle to read a few subtitles (I am dreading the remake of Infernal Affairs by the way) and c) I can't stand Josh Hartnett, 'nuff said there. <br /><br />However, I came across WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour in, and I have to say initially, it made no sense at all, until about half an hour from the end, when it started coming together. By the end, I was really surprised to find myself really into it, and then the ending just seemed so good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices I've ever seen (heard??).<br /><br />Since then I've heard a lot about the L'Appartement vs. Wicker Park argument and looking at WP, I still say it has bugger all to do with Chicago, but there seemed something about it that I liked, so when it was on again, I watched it again - unfortunately, still missing the first chunk (I've still yet to see it!), and I still thought it was pretty good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett seemed good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So I waited and waited to catch l'Appartement somewhere somehow. Netflix let me down, so I ended up getting a copy from some website in Ireland. And I've just watched it. <br /><br />It's really kind of weird, but a good weird. A classic French film. Great acting, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts Monica Bellucci off the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone's told him his puppy's been run over was excruciating! But, I can honestly say, having seen WP and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy (as about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but come on, the scene with the coffee in the glasses?? Word for word!!), you can imagine my surprise when I watched the ending of L'Appartement!! I can literally say I was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old Lucien was through the cafe window really! So, be prepared, if you've seen Wicker Park and you fancy taking a look at the original like I did, do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you'll either be disappointed, or exhilarated at a piece of French movie history - a prime example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to watch a pithy happy ending, and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end. Definitely catch this movie. Oh and while you're at, maybe not too near the same time, but down the road, take a look at Wicker Park, it'll surprise you too.	-5.186469331252867	-5.1855603172607445	-4.294114419847632	-3.474193284225293	-2.2276160538918615	-1.8962022018674276	-1.5211749553778937	-1.4161379403540495	-1.2098836587623543	-1.0193897058567276	-0.3966658526361159	-0.30553742559133296	-0.18588472848493787	0.013908784338634319	0.19219006294469093	0.4188139616050911	0.6685242877205506	0.849099768113212	2.1751099267412695	2.1876652805050996	2.2304421449825043	2.386476476173724	3.5339871034379375	5.026550551688866	8.574049448649673	
The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on.<br /><br />This film is asinine. It's like so many other 21st century grind house fodder. The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting. I didn't care about any of the characters, but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap: I'd complain about the money I spent, but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining "Live Free or Die Hard," which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of "Captivity" for 40 minutes.	-2.157276266476954	-0.9664299492269446	-0.8482944378619721	-0.779603197102307	-0.6972379157136247	-0.5938828040094806	-0.3453838113635177	-0.2882469395725459	-0.1645127278216273	-0.16087648677171934	-0.07860799848445812	-0.04940376394746557	0.03534873156882784	0.11018810126404566	0.11065186171951859	0.15735432383499498	0.22704332594555626	0.30329856254909804	0.3528515676249421	0.364758103852059	0.4453862971460936	0.4504446546058679	0.4780318259238021	1.15513983833427	2.1732601230987525	
ASCENDING to power in 1933, Hitler and his "National Socialist German Workers Party", which of course we all know as the Nazis, tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by. Early in their rough-shod trampling of the German People, they called any and all artists, newspaper men and film makers into their Nazi HQ in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared "Third Reich" (aka 'Empire') expected of them.<br /><br />WHEN the Master Director from the German Cinema's Silent Impressionist and Expressionist era, Mr. Fritz Lang, was called in to meet with Herr Goebels; he listened attentively and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the Minister of Propaganda's office, Herr Lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Not even going back to his residence, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least not until many years later. He remained in France; eventually immigrating to the United States of America.* <br /><br />MR. LANG went right to work in America; creating a variety of most enjoyable, solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year. Included in this smörgåsbord of titles is today's lucky subject, WESTERN UNION (20th Century-Fox, 1941).<br /><br />TYPICALLY a film about the Old West and Pioneer Days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast. WESTERN UNION qualified on both requisites. We are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses.<br /><br />HEADING up the playbill are Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore. Others prominently displayed are folks like John Carradine (playing not a vampire or other scary guy, but a Physician), George "Slim" Summerville (veteran character actor, Silent Film veteran and graduate of Mack Sennett's Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (always dependable supporting player and former singer in "The Avalon Boys") and burly bad guy Barton MacLane. Added to this mix, we have names like Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard's bro).<br /><br />PROMINENT in those American Indians featured are: Chief Big Tree, Chief Thundercloud and Mr. Jay Silverheels. Also featured is that one great representative of the Aboriginal Peoples of North America is that great, singularly impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, the Louisiana Native, Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera DeCorti of Sicilian immigrant parents).<br /><br />THE filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in Arizona and Utah and rendered in the highest grade of Technigolour available. (There is no Monument Valley; but then, that's the Province of Mr. John Ford.) IN some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think; for it took a sort of pulp magazine story, adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre-war America of the late thirties and early forties. All of this being done by a German born Director who was only had been in Hollywood and America for the shortest length of time.<br /><br />IN its final analysis, WESTERN UNION, while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the Western Genre; we just don't care. It scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies! SO, who really cares about little details such as "accuracy"? <br /><br />WE give Mr. Lang and 20th Century-Fox a rating of ****!<br /><br />NOTE: * We just saw a special on PBS station WTTW, here in Chicago that was all about all of the Film Actors, Directors and other Artisans whom the Nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in America and Hollywood. (It seems that Movie Folks and Scientists were the biggest Export for Germany at this particular time; being that the Scientists who built the Atomic Bomb, as well as the future NASA people, came from Europe at this time.) <br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!!	-7.397210831753547	-5.67731779710564	-5.007067066329306	-3.8353324531488973	-3.4286996899602684	-0.9282499149424056	-0.8635781322313297	-0.7307996071992257	-0.6818979742138858	-0.6285604117967623	-0.6228653959201899	-0.5352455875472659	-0.2490754758770623	-0.17526775606156497	0.25831717171074875	0.262072546325058	1.2372698216496656	2.0489171720231534	2.079794022188032	2.2476211885095845	2.285275102405808	2.840958258706767	2.9168516928142076	6.178601207037778	10.937491613123253	
A film I expected very little from, and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be. Roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good', it is funny throughout, the characters are endearing and the pace is just right.<br /><br />Toby Malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of Matt, said country boy and local Aussie Rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams. He is supported superbly by John Batchelor as local gangster Tiny. Watch out for these two.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	-1.9682278542685436	-1.1438575229112822	-1.0551072494984401	-0.4271165668458147	-0.4143172516607103	-0.1944928097283444	-0.03974100577276628	-0.03613557758760573	0.03126789298059757	0.07374436540419729	0.2091064692177509	0.22314765682704424	0.22437888678804188	0.24267301042725714	0.4979590183783439	0.5053787603698369	0.5072074529388674	0.6017108911886613	0.6551394457483565	0.676026580464166	0.9960536347932125	1.213631137511288	1.3455636724011304	1.6245513847604147	1.9226859709213098	
This movie is so bad it's funny. It stars Scott Backula as some coach, but that's not important, what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base. First off he has to be at least 75 years old, yet still plays minor league baseball, second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk, let alone run. Coach Backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film, (SPOILER), he tells his star player "downtown" to hit a home run, clearly "downtown" viewed this as a good move. He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a minor league squad playing the Twins who were the class of the majors in the movie. Now if only Tony Muser, manager of the Royals, would be as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat, the Royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game.	-1.5300480826761997	-1.4239206264049291	-1.3464327828638996	-1.0640062918824236	-0.811995265563469	-0.7415552376102991	-0.5301798182159841	-0.305686302166723	-0.26943518699849606	-0.06199798264715889	0.043973331827810415	0.13559272992297888	0.16981998479382915	0.19989837528812499	0.21187814737928606	0.22785128992400583	0.26551314953481336	0.29558870675918997	0.6377732508110858	0.67637207326685	0.905280281180093	1.3210802229263063	1.4553951620538512	2.157125846914	3.272197592664448	
The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. Errol Flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never more villainous. Anthony Quinn never more noble than as Crazy Horse. It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. The one historical aspect I found most glaringly inaccurate was the final "Last Stand" which occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn. The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. However, I still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of Hollywood's golden age.	-2.3721987842989347	-2.1094249561181075	-1.465223997675153	-1.0154529587338865	-0.8012426597971684	-0.3421936266517586	-0.2924370142141178	-0.23702122670843145	-0.23013212171944222	-0.19509933824725229	-0.13164831444916808	-0.019017960144468743	0.05243010469390505	0.08349447916951472	0.14017489253357307	0.1980273879839649	0.32692691134427115	0.3535917822567758	0.4297537449113979	0.6034294275000711	0.6579231396814822	1.10110604765493	1.6775717060423834	2.0586093806267143	3.021121410269703	
I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And this went on and on. If Mr. McElwee's family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee's family began it tobacco business ; I expected more than McEwee's continual focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the state's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco. The countless references to the movie "Bright Leaves" are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee's great grandfather? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film? I didn't.	-4.252453069903896	-1.9717166965832846	-1.8055506951756501	-1.2812538229697485	-1.142798128604441	-0.8157656114421584	-0.8103971848595788	-0.6426539755938502	-0.3440824926761517	-0.32566711938889675	-0.21987639072024046	-0.04383638661914112	0.06604949215692997	0.10078769030322834	0.15086392910129545	0.20601442365579684	0.4496110904289408	0.46832186903621364	0.5761348971014962	0.6470646898401446	0.6718678306806789	0.8648011466629076	1.446273996716519	2.8871923785854205	4.633132235213781	
Such a long awaited movie.. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day.. From the trailers it looked like a action movie, but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they've done their part of the movie very well. Good acting, but i don't think that can save the movie.. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-)<br /><br />Action sequences were shot very shabbily, no one could make out head & tail of the stunts, they've used Akki(akshay kumar) very well but could've been done much much better..<br /><br />Animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies(90's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake).<br /><br />And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins, just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess..	-5.486671160929718	-2.4618878773968063	-2.1980265870349145	-1.9814156903297269	-1.8554191720784807	-1.492540769263969	-1.276954533243676	-1.1450971248160338	-0.7787445854518317	-0.6880704189513395	-0.5231107321236013	-0.44071515654491844	-0.35327604443302546	-0.22395316155680806	-0.008021802750123624	0.24273821196183692	0.3283934538952178	0.3722428582114342	0.43279366886457454	0.8836534536397331	0.9744877494703886	1.1707897176419568	1.2567138251748005	2.4616644530015552	4.060381981534486	
Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two- hour drag. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that lights up this film. Robin Trower's music is also a welcomed addition.	-3.80560700546672	-2.323953828984884	-1.8709252884136103	-1.8357561198200492	-1.797029892522794	-1.0657804744162434	-0.796550180969889	-0.6753290836002407	-0.5042470183377733	-0.2843916294465143	-0.2131304046803458	-0.14313491737853717	-0.07848174833630887	-0.05279085032109958	0.07382387062721116	0.2128834180955505	0.3106624306208903	0.6395133511408887	0.9014685318480172	0.962001296977678	0.9656662641822162	0.9880607414115005	1.134180225340883	2.3079827266712303	3.7411436977187913	
I'm not a Disney fan at all, but I happen to be in Orlando for a friend's wedding. So my traveling partner and I went to Disney for a few days. I haven't seen a good 3-D effect in, well..ever. So I usually try to stay away from these presentations. The 3-D effect in this was so good. I'm a grown man of 38, and even I wanted to try and reach out and touch. It's THAT good! Word of advice. At the end, look to the back of the theater on the wall. Put it like this...the first time I saw it, the effect wasn't working. So I told my friend..."It would have been nice if...." My friend said, "That's exactly what happens. It's not working for some reason." It's an awesome show.

Recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work, handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual, but the entire family. Without resorting to preaching or Hollywood sappy endings, Tony Marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way.<br /><br />Highest praise goes David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances. I had presumed before watching the drama that I would see some of their previous on screen relationship in Blackpool bleed through-- but it never does. Neither actor is recognizable from any previous work, and I didn't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Treadaway's performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic - throughout the piece, he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house,<br /><br />At times, nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic. As the viewer, I wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality, stop moping, and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I see myself acting like any of them - switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything, including behavior that is completely unlike myself. It's the show's greatest strength - truth, without sugar coating, to force us all to think what we'd be able to do under the same circumstances.<br /><br />This is a difficult, but must-watch show. I hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the U.S.	-1.732063138456911	-1.7201657627959714	-1.5712883514441316	-1.4646930175881006	-1.1516825846021774	-0.7025542817783025	-0.47681544592105946	-0.41312465049124275	-0.2630661619642727	-0.04727841047460917	0.012631218355956125	0.04844706462262276	0.11768960402933462	0.1637478331411663	0.17090517519209794	0.3876333492816788	0.5293574303913489	0.6112598779491988	0.7579885809849055	0.8020893302885018	1.0952161596450485	1.3998920094346483	2.078816169502412	2.4007252166467623	3.9582919769194587	
This film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. I loved the character of Matt, and also Tiny. They seemed the most engaging and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his no good cousin), and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy. I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor, Eric Bana. My personal favourite part was the brothel scene, loved that. Overall, I liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating. The penalty however, I was disappointed in. It was a side foot curl, rather than the appropriate laces blast.<br /><br />I am of course kidding. :)	-3.292673086495785	-2.8582124244583755	-2.0604370142449024	-1.6582183536227042	-1.502860206989196	-0.6656467513030327	-0.39431515650200216	-0.06452355242018049	0.06746143867104676	0.10748529007390424	0.30648226974317844	0.34006921355757513	0.3664588589404815	0.3779860284627073	0.41657120275463794	0.7777533391587018	0.8096320756430957	0.8379185788666664	1.0277542267543749	1.2627671917030787	1.4423712867856442	1.44534033531257	2.9414145913729293	3.4426463584709417	3.6786635595483075	
Please, why on Earth did Bava had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crap?<br /><br />To begin with we, "the viewers" at home are treated to a narration from some unknown ding-bat informing us of the aftermath events of the previous episode indicating mankind's triumph over the demons, (yeah right).<br /><br />I can tell you "right now" that this doesn't in anyway what-so-ever have anything to do with Demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether. Bava as usual, makes a casual appearance that doesn't even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all. Acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a TV set, Oh God I'm not going to go on. Go see for yourself.<br /><br />As usual you'll be treated to laughable dubbing, crap scenarios that don't make any sense and above all un-answered questions. How typical of a sequel that dished out the first batch of crap.<br /><br />Overall if you're one of those DVD Argentophile collector's, then maybe you'll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague, it's no way near the first, so you may wanna avoid like the plague.	-5.232907654925112	-2.9273652798120446	-2.8906618723990833	-2.8523182475467452	-2.4955760466526553	-1.0983156917656238	-0.6304648133558871	-0.43387572858220447	-0.41148865722037964	-0.399710772217583	-0.39556050510930085	-0.3369068308626044	-0.24921918908120863	-0.24583198405600046	0.17601901638897882	0.24432328818216334	0.33755654111036293	0.3905769082029082	0.4882935923734537	0.775350252299113	0.9007963435897473	1.1006242399480894	1.6602350381225535	2.7849042680415748	5.2195759891219105	
I saw this film on the A&E channel this past weekend. The mystery was okay, I was not able to guess the culprit before the end. But I enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery. There was a mystery about some of them, especially George Abernathie, performed by the wonderful Michael Fassbender, and George's cousin, Susannah. In fact, the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more. From what I've tried to glee about the Agatha Christie book of the same title, I think this film did not follow it to the letter. Very good performances by the actors involved, especially Fassbender and the lady who played Cora/companion.	-3.0440909142869828	-1.335270103371969	-1.1020876488668447	-1.07006702550046	-0.5483721679003604	-0.27998609090825943	-0.2717069863877476	-0.00787496048436287	0.1138226977112909	0.20143031752216545	0.30272816835796756	0.3219200364519791	0.3856396716335396	0.3939580842078488	0.4394187694782664	0.5063469588542433	0.548777216790178	0.5986857718217623	0.6210926155304645	0.7046460142876951	0.846808836663326	0.9129077748464802	2.0529841011610697	2.7823852985253876	3.170966838723389	
Yeah, I'm sure it really could be a nation . . . if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times. Man, I am REALLY glad that I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of the George Romero movies and I'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard. I mean, what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like Charlie's Devils? It really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer, especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop/police station/apartment/flat/whatever room it was with the gong in the background, and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop. I couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't help either. Oh well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world. So, for all of those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad C movies (C for Craptastic), then this is the movie for you . . . or not.	-3.945112709536723	-1.9955937795708532	-1.699723773170625	-1.6664157878286392	-1.4931816930124142	-1.438489773187258	-1.1759653057548187	-0.28609189521138945	-0.09947902769613975	-0.03780901607489455	-0.016677194749533216	0.03730148852728484	0.16532648424273244	0.20615359785595155	0.2589797112095311	0.2715219343429011	0.3392211301764617	0.3485702627609632	0.35187720113482934	0.6419415113509642	0.7288169763991855	1.0024258981452647	1.5790028781124206	2.4980481141646145	4.893756614917719	
I walked into Blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. So i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R!? YAY! Although I will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'Speed' then i was sold. Sadly Sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: "Panicky kidnapped girlfriend" (She is in fifth place on the actors listing for Jeebus shakes!) Apparently this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie, i figured as much) Sandra is the only living human in this movie, everyone else might as well be a Zombie in a B-Horror Flick. This movie deceived me saying Sandra was the lead . . . i fell for it like Biff from 'Back to the Future' when Marty yells "WHAT'S THAT . . .!!!" God, i wish i watched that instead of this.<br /><br />Sandra is the only bright side of this movie, every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock paddles and yelling "CLEAR!" to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries. More on Sandra later . . . <br /><br />The Movie is dull. Very Dull. Think of the Dullest moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for 110 minutes (for me, it is this movie). This movie even somehow makes Gun Fights and Bullet time effects boring, so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers are put to shame. And this movie's idea of Bullet Time is a close up of an AK in slow motion which mocks you as the caps spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly ticks away. And I knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast forwarding "THROUGH-THE-ACTION!" The plot? . . . there was a plot? Music? . . . even by 80s muck standards is Bad but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and . . . ummm . . . moving on. Is it any good since it IS rated R? No, unless R stands for Ridicules-snooze-fest.<br /><br />And it is really 80s Cliché when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city (rocking guitar licks or power ballet) and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes. Both of which this movie satisfies. At least this movie establishes what era it's from which was unnecessary since Sandra's hair was screaming "1980s!!!!" And a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box, which you respond to sadly saying: "that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got." Another Hammy moment is at the beginning when some-Secret-Agent-Dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die. All that scene needed was the Mario death ditty or maybe Contra sound effects but Nintendo might have sued.<br /><br />And it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other BETTER movie icons. Before the big gun scene, Da hero is found standing in a boxing ring ('Rocky' anyone?), sporting a leather fedora (not 'Indiana Jones' too) with an ominous spotlights behind him (Terminator the 2nd before owning T-1000) What is really REALLY sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can film better quality videos (with a crappy webcam no less) then this movie. I'm serious, most Rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie. I cannot even call this movie by it's given name for it's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a freaking violation against human rights!) The only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is Sandra's career started taking off thanks to this movie. But oh Sandra . . . why did you have to be in such a nightmare? The paycheck better been worth it. The DVD also graces you with a little back story on Sandra as an extra, seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name. Which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs, Crafty little critter.<br /><br />I don't have much experience with bad films but i know BAD when i see it. I could bounce back from 'Mazes and Monsters' with a good old campy Bruce Willis Comedy. But not even Bruce could cheer me up after this movie. I have yet to see any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll but I think I'm amped for them now. For i can't even fathom a movie worse then . . . "GAG" . . . 'Hangmen' . . .	-18.164266715222507	-9.13444063832516	-8.207620743533912	-8.07687957973972	-7.091072716789007	-6.26211266402715	-5.731542348419434	-1.337334291108762	-1.0471121766837255	-0.6520115278112613	-0.6439331256131173	-0.327523664770462	-0.08497864585270472	1.0570691674303327	1.3003598132730436	1.4741655886406928	1.8809481094499403	1.9744778168104085	2.0172669899118496	2.674253384656676	3.0216091600746124	3.114264747315	6.675513320664133	10.994333631819135	21.794614494026597	
"Beyond the Clouds" is an over-the-top artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a man-woman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent. Although the film offers superb cinematography, some exquisite visual beauty, and a cast of fine performers, there's little meat on the bones of this fragmented work. A taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and synergism suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four. Nonetheless, "Beyond the Clouds" will be fodder for dilettantes and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial, stilted, and lacking in substance.	-1.1754940805056826	-0.8694946736706373	-0.5390321299604027	-0.5341650828336391	-0.4664109892138433	-0.4298124781294018	-0.15917105121032815	-0.13915953452320232	-0.07330376290271805	0.005559584784644779	0.01148522878726202	0.02080904797167374	0.0656039515270741	0.0702052016687401	0.11119864027285055	0.11418162716874972	0.16505398459213333	0.18146920542370293	0.2036662012784762	0.37908034317407474	0.5555628518378444	0.5657187486999927	1.041744623329619	1.085767573540746	1.4581731540578984	
In the very first episode of Friends, which aired 22 Sept 1994 "The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate" there is a song playing as Rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show, the line that plays is: "If you ever need holding".... does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song? It is seems as if it is a great song....I would love to get a copy of it. Thanks for the assistance. I am looking for the album/cd it is on so I can purchase it. <br /><br />I have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again.

This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. A friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. Ehh... Where to start? The writing, the acting, the quality? All of it, sucked. <br /><br />Quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. The dialog was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialog, such as "how ya doing?"..."not that great, doc" (directly after an attempted exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide. Of course he's not that great.) was, at some points, kind of funny. If not horribly written, planned out, and obvious. The general plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked, HORRIBLE. It was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could. The only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & Peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film. Oh yeah, and they never actually got the deed done.<br /><br />The acting? Horrible. x100. I think the only good actor was the short Spanish guy who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written horribly. The worst acting? Arguably Paul Kappellas, whose acting combined with shitty music, a gun, and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through. He even screwed up his own death scene, one that should have been easy to nail. Although, most everybody else's acting was horrible as well.<br /><br />The lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie. There were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died, that same amount of people became possessed at one point, and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand. Like... 50 thumbs down.<br /><br />P.S. What IS it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable, anyways?	-15.455119992021858	-7.5519002092791965	-7.427148799604137	-6.803057771051324	-6.013795045231703	-4.236125966839298	-3.31195251766054	-0.8723949580311319	-0.8070064303097642	-0.6233920295919011	-0.30879546969125565	-0.23320629761049383	-0.22675672154056487	-0.19172166090563064	0.588529278980493	1.4586185492763497	1.5325612001492503	1.6519489592605334	1.722460335516112	2.4437012603820394	2.5953411184150865	2.854926363648748	4.989123349812729	8.876878054893549	17.0252727175938	
Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting. The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the film worth catching.

I enjoyed the first reviewer's comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a second-run theatre in the early '80's. I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings. But to me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction I think of as being unusually static, and the photography murky. The rating jotted down at the time was a nought, which means "not worth sitting through even once".<br /><br />Still, I too would jump at a chance to have a second look.	-1.850568686665654	-1.2212568674719686	-1.2003678480498432	-1.1911913857472631	-0.9753562866445189	-0.7262319756208123	-0.43121355258689836	-0.389849739810265	-0.3385333707460357	-0.10913574464124406	-0.08122407922358996	-0.003336946243581773	0.18761650930747692	0.20152360207194975	0.21582426152144435	0.25324252036292616	0.29099166628312756	0.2985875224849407	0.3152864243589551	0.4043594039971191	0.4939201005261162	0.6282612620396211	0.9672669514609682	1.8002513485959106	2.791568441439768	
After seeing several movies of Villaronga, I had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting about a rhythm of the movie. That is why, though having good critics, his movies never caught the broad audience attention. In ARo he follows the same line, but really improved on the rhythm, especially in the end of the movie. Frankly speaking, I slept through the first part, cause though the first part gives necessary information, it is really slow. Nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga.<br /><br />Recommended.	-1.4392717881913413	-1.3890673884280575	-1.1160173841969514	-1.0352502170768807	-0.9740276803983231	-0.9617150209762688	-0.6153743116162024	-0.5186142044495528	-0.4533917931506404	-0.22908012930808966	-0.1670680341077485	0.06814786730848549	0.08908230388061777	0.20541929079829938	0.2342328197567012	0.34965904041485885	0.4165941377602086	0.4246438069780335	0.42747003925125365	0.5739626518501715	0.8274779365972338	0.8303518358517195	1.2302519153749274	2.05788074587129	2.8424877442786225	
What a bad, bad film!!! I can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious, amateurish excuse for a real movie!! I left the theater before the end, stunned by how bad the direction and camera-work of that movie were!! And to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry.<br /><br />At least this film showed me once and for all that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film-making than anything else.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs. You'll want your time back! I know I did.	-4.090197301083187	-2.443344400564404	-2.1784580762511903	-1.6939210677123375	-1.6611978096756699	-1.6220910594441766	-1.3017219926001173	-0.45617337581868295	-0.42057270177305045	-0.304188709676397	-0.15925519279142303	-0.022678077253024148	0.0399896565315894	0.20645724288706177	0.2092212422340649	0.33619613966808715	0.3920208006619292	0.4050469994778071	0.5292156746168856	0.6578286995618552	0.6819037183838984	0.7192766799879472	1.4936497521226741	2.593187034203481	4.658518281343411	
I'm trying to picture the pitch for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking Matrix, I'm thinking Bladerunner, I'm thinking that chick that plays Faith in Angel, wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her, leave that one with us. Only - get this! - we'll do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike. Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes, right?"<br /><br />Flashy, shallow, dreary, formulaic, passionless, tedious, dull, dumb, humourless, desultory, barely competent. Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life.

I blame "Birth of a Nation" myself - for commencing the long-running tradition of Hollywood travesties of history, of which there can be few greater examples than this. Apart from getting the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and the Sioux and President Grant spelt right, the geography correct and the fact that Custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man, the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits. Throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition, (try Custer and his wife's learning of the phony "Gold Rush" to excuse the invasion of the Sioux territory, Custer's testimony in front of Congress pleading the rights of the Red Indians and to top it all, Custer's storming into the president's office to beg to return to his post), honestly there's plenty more of the same, some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness... ...And yet, and yet, it's still a great actioner with Flynn as dashing as ever, DeHavilland as beguiling as ever, the young Anthony Quinn getting a start as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we're closer to the legend of the legend but hey, it's only a movie and a rollicking, wonderfully enjoyable classic Hollywood movie at that!	-1.4264074931225244	-0.9205708477684262	-0.8463633331368957	-0.6997786245104405	-0.6485406464752463	-0.40819261818499036	-0.28750786063703754	-0.2872452753640198	-0.22108859350317822	-0.1753070601230387	0.005135315355199996	0.006554819985376062	0.03589627975690758	0.08789585115255316	0.1069385610365467	0.14241630003388692	0.15026091027205707	0.22440290090862747	0.2628223638029014	0.30128156772753345	0.5833869529833309	0.6981117123149171	0.7147155770340162	0.7675204842428642	2.532534270734502	
This movie was poorly written, poorly acted and very predictable. It was very low-budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video. It wasn't even campy fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them. <br /><br />The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this.<br /><br />ejames6342	-4.41145009171308	-3.084787240879232	-2.831427977357925	-2.5823676184619737	-2.357829278057329	-0.92145017155925	-0.9175075791932192	-0.8148692450634287	-0.49791965330151955	-0.47920664044756567	-0.35090135605839745	-0.1568696065856158	-0.09649510632669867	0.06533868176243723	0.0922657492335015	0.11247135938678388	0.29541707057650274	0.8556132349736661	0.8562888971591429	0.8895251055312465	1.1778779597831093	1.1872636388685458	1.4579205949393668	3.3379629531284665	4.69106578484069	
A frustrating documentary. Louis Kahn's son, who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created, takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life. It sounds like a great idea for a documentary, but it ends up flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />Sadly, the basic problem is that Kahn's son, Nathaniel, is not just one of the film's protagonists --- he is also director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles. Further, while he seems like a nice enough guy, he doesn't have much screen presence, so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing. <br /><br />Nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer --- there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of Nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid "uh-huh," as if he's a little panicked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response. At times, I felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about Kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation. <br /><br />Nathaniel's dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help. One senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, presumably because it's not clear from Nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his Dad -- preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his Dad really did care more for Nathaniel and his mother than seems likely. His passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel does push is his own mother, but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama (Aren't you ANGRY, Mom?") and don't offer much in terms of helping us (or Nathaniel) understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /><br />What the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. An independent director could have stood away from the material, given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and, one hopes, cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work, such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see Kahn die (which made it look as if Nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony) or the entire bit about hooking up with Kahn's first cousin, who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel. Too many times Nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a Kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer. (Ahhh huh. Thaaat's nice, sir. UmmI gotta go now.) I understand why these things might be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be TOO personal.<br /><br />As an aside, I thought the score written for the film was great! (But, one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when, during the tour of the Kimball Art Museum, the voice-over quotes Kahn as making a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. The music being played at the same time? Beethoven's NINTH Symphony. A mistake? A miscue? Who knows? It did make me laugh.) <br /><br />Kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story. There's definitely a good documentary to be made about him. One is sympathetic to Nathaniel's search for the father he didn't know, but I'm not sure whether THAT is an interesting story. Neither works so well in this film.	-8.074697381802695	-5.613718199073687	-4.465924251998588	-3.9957322557786816	-2.758986146972728	-2.4352789671201758	-1.8288676114207874	-0.37317372124723286	-0.3575840254844348	-0.23346018251807055	-0.10417273465333014	-0.09263005097429193	0.06657210668070572	0.1218596599588205	0.12809677036461825	0.4681517433141884	0.6333784294205949	0.6839498797547533	1.5010266886996644	2.0932030719691856	2.292759943730848	3.508402734078777	3.7242767763597038	5.802623566480159	10.9031935591892	
Try as I might, I just simply couldn't get into this one. Perhaps it was the washed out tones; perhaps it was the drawn-out approach--I'm not really sure, but though this was by no means a "bad" movie, I didn't really find it to be very much of an "effective" movie (words that I understand are so much more arbitrary than their common uses).<br /><br />So, basically, the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys' deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, triggering a witch hunt. What do the boys' death have to do with the mysterious, sexy woman who has appeared in town? Is the crazy hermit woman involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of crime drama and horror as the various townspeople are all suspect and corpses keep appearing while bloody violence ensues.<br /><br />Good enough, but to me, most of it fell a little flat. Oh, it had it's moments... the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter commentary (even if the effects themselves failed, considering her skin seemed to peel off as if they were whipping her with red-hot irons).<br /><br />My biggest issue was the ending. I've already put spoiler tags on this review, but BE WARNED, HERE'S THE BIG SPOILER: I don't believe it. I don't believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that psychosis appearing earlier, with other boys, with a history, or some other personal affect. The movie didn't really earn its ending. END SPOILERS.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Fulci is a big name and I'm more than certain there's an audience out there for this. I definitely need to check out more that he's done, because this may have been a poor introduction. Most Italian giallo is hit-or-miss anyway, so I'm waiting to see what else this guy can do before writing him off.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB	-8.561794281878775	-3.8502347582896124	-3.5532841385764904	-3.0397876392238303	-2.804489361263338	-2.2847899462529475	-1.584197088358318	-1.0404023578439854	-0.9972370077500882	-0.8187384359315356	-0.5805787542214406	-0.2312100879178286	-0.21044036436291222	0.21099085953764093	0.25156386101669037	0.3002160197687461	0.30448040518982833	0.7214972001756188	1.080698333806747	1.0847176981362254	1.114631144828407	1.4102383996484151	3.6102356600650665	3.927977591354864	8.609884611816858	
ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film, but it is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode. It is the story of love, both genuine and illicit, as well as overweening ambition, devotion, and the arrogance of personal tyranny. A previous reviewer, John Mankin, questions why the central focus of the film, the mansion called Elephant Walk, should have been built by the former owner, the "governor" the late Tom Wiley, right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water, the river. To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film: the hubris of man. That his son, played by Peter Finch, should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father, is not unexpected, since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models. The point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking, and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated, but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd, and thus he would dominate his son and all around him, and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water? This is the nexus of the film: what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love? Ceylon, today's Sri Lanka, is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story, not just the expenses of Miss Taylor. Were it not for this exotic location (much of the film was shot in Ceylon), and the magnificent "bungalow" this would have been just another potboiler. One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place, as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the British raj. It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony, teak, and marble. Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees (grille work window and doorway borders) evidently specified by art directors J. McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.<br /><br />For those immune to the blandishments of time, place, and architecture, there is always the allure of Miss Taylor, as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man, against the background described, and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased. As I said, it is not great literature nor even great film, but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today.<br /><br />This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in, not on the home TV, so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope.	-4.611321820698242	-3.5263926017713354	-3.4393729904977195	-2.7098761291322093	-2.656767250487187	-2.4495474646407174	-1.309321163753403	-0.6305730279063275	-0.625518497191295	-0.2702275641264107	-0.057446234984105365	0.023458505773147925	0.02698111387570229	0.09716798576988527	0.3824269403995329	0.39298781478207656	0.6022979506741715	0.6908091523016704	1.1509360680365424	1.3908111154224228	1.4199871722165505	1.805609768908229	2.2813695369545126	4.257495855752992	7.7024818572389195	
Errol Flynn's roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous (and some would say infamous) General Custer, that follows his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and out west to the battle at The Little Big Horn, all the while butting heads with rival Arthur Kennedy and romancing pretty Olivia de Havilland.<br /><br />Some might say that Flynn, who delivers a great, flamboyant performance as the general, is basically playing himself playing Custer!<br /><br />A lavish production (that should have been in Technicolor) well directed by Raoul Walsh, They Died With Their Boots On features some truly well-staged battle sequences. Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.<br /><br />The previous year, Flynn played Jeb Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's George Custer in Santa Fe Trail (also with de Havilland), another action-packed Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail history class!	-1.1898607770563612	-0.9044784167586841	-0.7831376930195357	-0.596432166802818	-0.2986954120928536	-0.28335051808262646	-0.26293448888865123	-0.20590027159701402	-0.13083545472759242	-0.07866930124769254	-0.06280281082973671	-0.02126943713987995	-0.017073127317071606	0.021066118866703593	0.319372089750839	0.33823377422845685	0.3578970897007795	0.3959587781246283	0.39829001631892985	0.49930337634035293	0.5918795396720733	0.7192598361548947	0.9622264659497308	1.3272013278528865	1.3733433366605776	
If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. This film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. I wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it was filmed for a film contest. The acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw script writer. My family laughed at it. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You won't be scared by this one. Here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film. When the guy gets his toe stomped by Ric White's stupid portrayal of the Reverend James Johnston walking cane. The guys reactions are like if he had an amputation with no pain killer. Watch the DVD extras after you watch the movie. When you see Ric White and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh till your stomach hurts. How people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck. Don't get fooled like we did and buy this failure.	-5.332237341557067	-3.5517973833443954	-3.1348134354331414	-3.1099551221995667	-2.2466334462055655	-2.009556747974739	-1.9918606273820645	-0.6485599582027365	-0.4899044616766418	-0.12766588407500948	-0.045536032927361844	-0.012626697291241717	-0.0012726831247337894	0.037791582535839766	0.38305377004715246	0.5076796756634178	0.5373832876763841	0.7223886276042799	1.1321234042907116	1.280700541331568	1.4986572032016303	1.9813990995303048	2.147244839808118	4.410516292324507	7.688600426027638	
Wow. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found this Gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it looked like just the movie for my mood. I brought it home and put it on.<br /><br />This movie was not the B Horror movie that I had in mind. This was MUCH worse. I wanted a bad movie but what I got, I didn't know that crap like this existed amongst man. This movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it.<br /><br />I am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies. He needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs.<br /><br />If you are thinking about renting this or buying it. I will tell you the same thing that I would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide. "DON'T DO IT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT!" I really have nothing nice to say about this movie.

Soldier Blue is a movie with pretensions: pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man, on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples; a biting, unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but it fails miserably to be any of those things. What Soldier Blue actually is is pernicious, trite, badly made, dishonest rubbish.<br /><br />Another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies. What it is basically is a lame, clichéd, poorly acted "odd couple" romance - Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love (ah, bless) - bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a Lucio Fulci splatter flick.<br /><br />There is no excuse for the repulsive, prurient, gore-drenched climax, in which cute little native American children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close-up, and large-breasted native American women are molested, raped and strung up - no excuse, that is, except box office. (The massacre itself, whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention, is very badly staged and shot; a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, intercut with a few special-effects sequences of beheading/dismemberment - dismemberments, incidentally, which utilised real amputees in their filming. Now that's what I call exploitation.)<br /><br />Forget all the pap you've heard (including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie) about this being a "protest", an indictment of American brutality towards the native peoples. This film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the Cheyenne; had it done so it would have featured some involving native American characters, would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless, faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax. Instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of Bergen and Strauss (lousy actors both, in this at least), with plenty of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious.<br /><br />Which is a terrible shame, because there is a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre, about all of the real life massacres the US (and Britain, and all so-called "civilised" nations) have participated in over the centuries (Iraq?). this just isn't that movie.	-9.386877409241254	-5.0614394372262455	-4.959901925254538	-4.730855454365335	-3.906458896264941	-1.8838953685639859	-1.7874824087003258	-1.4288478559672368	-1.3136104596534939	-1.0312048453267	-0.41530893745926856	-0.10096097802502758	-0.08254232177680923	-0.07964482008871637	-0.05942414316881128	0.044546874377642785	0.1664203061811655	0.16963956866160512	0.7288665905622564	0.7977516755223824	1.0885674954841904	1.1834725019575618	4.170898575848507	4.895002004133942	9.128489100110757	
Here's another of the 1940's westerns that I watch whenever it comes on TCM or FMC, because although it may be flawed historically, it is extremely entertaining and well acted, plus it's got Randolph Scott, my favorite actor second only to Gary Cooper-Well, OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston, and Gregory Peck. But the film itself, to me anyway, is reasonably historically accurate and as I said before, well acted and "flows" very well-I bet I've seen it 50 or 60 times, and enjoy each viewing more than the one before. I have it on tape from TCM but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on DVD.

Great movie. Good acting ,a wonderful script. It's exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in. A pity about the ending; a 'page' of text of how Nynke's life went on, instead of moving images was a poor choice.

The show is at least partially Faked (So is not reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a Fake episode.<br /><br />Proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed There is already camera crew on the boat, before he gets there, can been seen as his boat approaches.<br /><br />The actors playing "ambulance officers" didn't remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it, which would never happen in reality.<br /><br />They also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the Emergency entrance (Which does not make any sense, unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there)	-2.8024384813748857	-1.463416489916379	-1.4622673414736571	-1.229808960290222	-1.1661617931252048	-0.5042834467458781	-0.42991290073622396	-0.41963965593927677	-0.3779712994256995	-0.3300500041498656	-0.3120174962221692	-0.294897598302919	-0.13130420806180795	0.06786607202032661	0.08997193168883033	0.2259716083188383	0.35966196596831834	0.3605208565914118	0.37842081283619766	0.40617209951342836	0.5060337525387542	0.7055414256269429	1.0818381948089217	1.3252966806109598	2.698540720624138	
Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. The usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a "forbidden" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. Fast forward (actually, you'll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding. Finally, more killings--but nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. If you want to see the kids butchered, opt for SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY THE 13TH over this	-3.3036648432861537	-1.4808885517979093	-1.2523829760516607	-1.231834777069299	-1.1876323899100383	-1.1399780210706467	-0.6952650747794908	-0.4749204704219665	-0.3682776764440598	-0.24624653424100393	-0.1928625790280886	-0.11068033120560361	-0.10177172491555411	-0.08053439629003116	-0.04850122396095008	0.06852919982021784	0.12393547922182757	0.24518254969170292	0.2656502256430238	0.3540220747802377	0.35963844365692793	0.5141845410344692	1.5082808081487535	1.556772316569763	3.4194149965179053	
First of all, f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft.<br /><br />Secondly, the f14's and f18's cannot change their appearances; they are not transformers. <br /><br />Thirdly, the f16 has only one m61 cannon, not two. <br /><br />Last but not the least, at the end of the film, Seagle selected sidewinder missile. But somehow when he pulled the trigger, the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick. As I have the experience of seeing f18's and f14's being mysteriously transformed into f16's, this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me. However, there is still one question I have to ask: How did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16...<br /><br />When students hand in really bad work, teachers assign 0's.

Movies about U.F.O.'s are always a nice way to kill some time, so on a rainy Sunday evening I picked up this flick, expecting what can be expected from a direct-to-DVD U.F.O. mystery.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong! At about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the U.F.O. theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda. And this is not just a Christan movie from an average Christian. No, this is Christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind. The scary kind.<br /><br />In the end of this movie, the non-believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the Rapture has started (which is believed by Christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non-believers are left behind).<br /><br />When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer, 'just in case we Christians are right'. Now that's a lamest excuse ever to become a Christian if you ask me!<br /><br />This movie still tries to convert non-believers using scare tactics. "Believe in God or you will go to Hell!" is the message here. Simple, but quite offensive, really. Especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different.<br /><br />Now let's assume you're a Christian fundamentalist yourself and you're not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie, is this a good movie? I'm afraid it isn't. No actually I'm lying: I'm GLAD it isn't! The acting is horrible, the pacing is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is laughably bad. As soon as the movie starts, you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected, and you will be right.<br /><br />In the first half hour, it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable U.F.O. mystery, but then suddenly they bring in this Count Dracula look-alike that starts babbling about the devil. At first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac, but as it turns out, he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie. As soon as you start realizing this, you know how this is going to end up. But actually it ends up worse.<br /><br />Avoid.	-10.006248542323702	-4.845549063640851	-4.229196612839766	-4.016131033089061	-3.699975125564782	-3.0491339941072875	-2.867918592856463	-1.3720989194067037	-1.0554542575526658	-0.9525131390243335	-0.8575316436337126	-0.6447387560090285	-0.10740269883335148	0.13819352256474265	0.2650326507129595	0.7049613300272193	0.9560662554226048	1.1875254954319892	1.2505934645835899	1.633664836019591	1.7384859437561961	2.484480418211347	3.424072694710787	5.04401923506859	10.851538343536358	
Probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this:<br /><br />1. They might not have read the book. 2. They might enjoy gore and violence in a film. 3. They might be very young and therefore not understand the violence. 4. People might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book. 5. There are sure to be many other reasons not covered here.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about this film is the song "'Bright Eyes".<br /><br />If perchance, you happen to be one of those people who has read the book, enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence, you are sure not to like this.

If you need that instant buzz that only late 60s/early 70s Euro sex movies can give off, then look no further for you have just stumbled across the mother lode ! Subsequent TV director Schivazappa's exercise in psychedelic porn (of the soft core variety) may not generally be considered as a classic of its kind but it knocks many better known titles from the likes of Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D'Amato for a loop. Radley Metzger sure was hip to this way before anyone else when he picked up this marvelously twisted little number for US distribution through his company Audubon. Gorgeous cinematography (favouring symmetrical compositions) may elicit cries of 'pretentiousness' from those who swear by shoddy skin flicks shot in someone's backyard. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, it's their loss for this is one thrill ride of a movie with twists so, well, twisted that you may not even believe them after you have actually witnessed them on screen ! Dagmar Lassander (immortalized as the gone to seed landlady from Lucio Fulci's HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY) has never looked more exquisite than she does here, subtly portraying the innocent (?) researcher held hostage by mad medic Philippe Leroy (with all the art-house favorites to his name, you wonder whether he has the good humor to mention this one on his c.v.) as their initially violent 'relationship' turns to S&M-tinged love story. Nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity. I for one was completely baffled and enchanted by the way Schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during one scene (I'll let you find that one out for yourselves...) and Lassander's gauze-clad boogie to an impossibly groovy 60s tune should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of Sylvia Kristel reclining in that wicker chair in her EMMANUELLE days. You may not know this film just yet, but trust me, once seen you'll never forget it !!!	-3.5755604406274233	-2.1369502679940644	-1.5891091549694916	-1.5752038514631694	-1.517472814439718	-0.993682234600093	-0.7296325975748008	-0.6295942711787008	-0.44519112629407354	-0.4048891720255175	-0.3819406888977384	-0.3259499764536911	-0.05230156843871048	0.08608513198402971	0.14594764940576935	0.40847348056539284	0.4732868147504581	0.5094322404989245	0.7450541716580983	0.8388262519211953	0.8477728231615779	1.0583872105404213	1.0870962735913958	2.5087253012055006	4.7059034505991395	
I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only enjoyment I got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background "car sounds" audio just disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times). Sandra Bullock plays essentially a bit part, completely unnecessary to the plot. To say that this movie actually HAS a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves. The antique computer hardware is kind of interesting. This film was released in 1982 (not 1987 as the IMDb database indicates) and then current "high tech" was an amber screen on a 4.8 MHz IBM PC with floppy drives. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie... at least it was interesting.<br /><br />We got this on DVD for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at WalMart. As the other reviewer notes, we paid too much!	-5.125509334784618	-2.772691224015142	-2.4057177897139597	-2.1553228837041796	-2.0702859011438455	-1.9868180719025847	-1.697915998244887	-0.49698757985420794	-0.17137932420473517	-0.168430102974034	-0.11835300882304214	-0.10818936732223447	-0.10167382277285374	0.021181258227342695	0.18956662877442992	0.4499449333081799	0.5934323219567055	0.6287800302806124	0.8285021750999415	0.930103405408898	1.0235142278317126	1.2317247566140836	1.4951974731370061	3.2873915075806432	6.009980996084155	
I saw this years ago, and it's entertaining, but not profound. The basic story is of a young man who dreams of Midian, though he's not sure where it is or even if it really exists.<br /><br />Spoilers Follow: He finally visits it, gets transformed to a Nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one. Then, he has to help the other members of the Nightbreed because they're being attacked by Canadians. (Save for the accents, they all act like Good Ol' Boys. Not much in tune with the Canadian psyche, eh?) Someone observed for "monsters" or "Nightbreed," substitute "Jews," and for the Canadians/humans, substitute, "Nazis," and you're supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans. Well, maybe.<br /><br />One major objection I had was that while the underground city was interesting, it was rather ramshackle and, frankly, dirty. This must be a convention for movies with underground settlements. One would think that if the monsters were the good guys, some would have at least a little sense of decor.<br /><br />The storyline is a tad thin, but that's to introduce characters. But it's entertaining enough for a repeat view.	-3.856525926116591	-2.21865322103709	-1.5706385199341675	-1.2988893570674307	-1.2317268797367291	-1.191456954747797	-1.083731400496592	-0.7006715772976443	-0.6298786702327613	-0.5324571694896971	-0.33104270405388814	-0.0268362308520442	0.08852955790242281	0.152698348765689	0.20489123489862995	0.5420541426956812	0.5796631813428119	0.5887212675675281	0.7484108546335081	0.81280825467638	0.825079625054145	0.9826196850549817	1.2382541507582918	2.0333247092847797	4.590523635328103	
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. We watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports.<br /><br />Its has moments but mostly it plays like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just don't work. Actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called Pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us stuff and it just seems cheap. Given the choice I'd watch Pontypool again rather than watch this film again.	-1.9341940979165042	-1.3492559784634708	-0.7956719856859398	-0.7603887039240718	-0.6460227511584563	-0.6011142719583344	-0.5376468300032317	-0.45355423935121886	-0.3966227345633689	-0.22836510325470755	-0.2156498078635325	-0.19962927983070836	-0.10842162409280198	-0.011334191390217296	0.11813631815802111	0.13774138905762942	0.2736109422961048	0.2882497119815842	0.47167946592694576	0.4752941328615323	0.502753236269094	0.5465288380355084	0.6539384758896485	1.226926203592891	2.2211711776949015	
The movie was very good when it came out, I attended Cooley High and Cooley upper grade center ,around 1968 i was also home coming queen and grew up and lived in the area of Cabrini Greens, i knew a lots of people in the movie, it was nice to see friends in the movie that lived in the area also, and they had a chance to be a star that may have been a once in a life time experience for them, i had good times growing up on the north side and tough times i can relate to the movie Cooley High is no longer standing but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had growing up attending Cooley High, there is a lot of history around this north side area to be told .	-0.5734338311445243	-0.2109694622993891	-0.1971693678820164	-0.07276381352136344	-0.059505134654849426	-0.03893550143686119	-0.03314764110447157	-0.03256225477019382	-0.02684539400167529	-0.02447926824335715	0.012445120633587825	0.018022527489660406	0.03283857222286279	0.04139867783243358	0.08706085076245168	0.16645486504921986	0.18961267699496778	0.2345076658424244	0.2448765230938631	0.2796155776561769	0.3114754122727818	0.4336719180609367	0.4867895006374377	0.49514367849633056	0.5790600200405766	
A gem from Japan, where so many of the world's best films are being made today. Stylistically, this isn't anything all that special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic overtones) about recognizable people going about their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for voicing the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50 year old spinster. She's takes pride in her health, spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After she is done with this part time job, she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store (called S-Mart, which made this Army of Darkness fan giggle). Along her milk route lives a 50 year old man, whose wife is dying. It turns out the milk woman and the man, a child services worker, dated in high school, and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other. The film actually has some major narrative problems. When the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique. The climactic sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters, as well as many side characters. The film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down, but never end up doing so. I think the best thing in the film is Tanaka's heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman, who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems were, the film mostly transcends them.	-3.8679096222314535	-2.7881344818993252	-2.6638126397168205	-2.588506156365832	-1.4937367968831718	-1.0933265260103298	-1.0523893617887725	-0.9477847411858605	-0.260706100833377	-0.1692923422890177	-0.11906642006415312	0.1391332546555146	0.25093922507697264	0.259290854532948	0.6669210881115271	0.8257478708584968	0.8380522627795216	0.8519896824084898	0.899410149531744	1.1337587537021403	1.1462763866679564	1.7338419095238022	3.9919987032038486	4.186727863383052	6.971545801393882	
Enjoy the opening credits. They're the best thing about this second-rate but inoffensive time-killer which features passable performances from the likes of Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, goes to newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who, nevertheless, occasionally manages to project a banty-rooster kind of belligerence. The first time we see him he's bare-chested, sweaty, and engaged in that favorite "beefcake" activity -- chopping wood. After this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon." He could use a better script, however, since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing. There's also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained. There are a few pluses, though. Sending "John Woodrow" undercover as "John Wilson" is an amusing play on a presidential name, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan shows promise as an inmate who, early in the proceedings, is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard. One final note: the movie's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras." Despite the impressive size of the prison, it only seems to hold about 12 inmates! (Note: the cast credits at the end aren't too helpful. For the record, the burly, bald-headed guard who uses Jody Nolan as a punching bag is played by Bill Fishback, and the young, fair-haired guard who administers electric shocks to Tommy Lee Thomas is played by Marc Chenail.)	-5.990880698408512	-2.478453339140684	-2.4517469890727033	-2.3555936333211496	-2.1778293233655273	-1.4909799685490521	-1.4304685742341312	-0.9163672344474384	-0.4404505019228188	-0.4181311910779832	-0.21382017198254152	0.003847593588182322	0.031683488331223114	0.31264371071176966	0.323261053932154	0.4436995443157688	0.5427179058608494	0.7864390392396363	0.890124405216688	0.914008157520974	0.9238985113619403	1.2625032206912588	2.646704312412164	2.8577869390329993	6.554921626988975	
I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me, no one knows it because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters, I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it needs to be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise -- what a waste of film!	-3.0196116295405773	-1.3879503480582909	-1.3236678868690466	-1.125995980867931	-0.9379929797542946	-0.6515415736628799	-0.6465487718927578	-0.4313312120377043	-0.22589261982903824	-0.053015760404540535	0.02751887778581877	0.02961251728306373	0.08315514607424632	0.14871390102968826	0.15301201737717163	0.2804512542221859	0.4372511069866245	0.46510004444022135	0.4787807814145863	0.5431501119708023	0.5627769487572438	1.0250347001461675	1.0734245532238598	1.7997463910196965	3.705634873755479	
Next to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz," this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's a true shame it's not as well-known as the former films (maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings, and that it's British, meaning a smaller market for films) but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation.<br /><br />Like all great family films, one can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager to enjoy this film (I'm currently 18), but one must appreciate classic films first. I absolutely adore this film. It has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) that rivals any John Williams "Star Wars" score, a fast but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialog, and use of color (both the sets and cinematography won Oscars), and state-of-the-art Oscar-winning special effects (for the time, and some are still stunning). And, of course, June Duprez's sultry looks as the Princess rivals that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks like Jones in a way!).<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to "The Adventures of Robin Hood") and it truly deserves more attention. It is a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and, along with "Robin Hood," it's my desert island film that I could watch over and over again without getting annoyed.<br /><br />Stars: **** (excellent)	-3.6619021506651768	-2.861792610304289	-1.2428751627614807	-1.2226291616108815	-1.1297287054417404	-0.32575564891146763	-0.22042077105523838	-0.11393482630159125	-0.02022480254888394	0.3422692247696925	0.3863196260862484	0.4370587411603094	0.498834359856156	0.6414531537092569	0.7120269267511513	0.7122542403890562	0.7956897677820653	0.8583860385441862	1.1744371819041355	1.267110558414788	1.2893312274377524	1.4276712649134153	2.4811569353048846	3.1689682573312803	3.640058113584562	
Although I have definitely read this particular Agatha Christie book at some point, I didn't remember anything about it except the name "Abernethie". Which is a good thing, because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer GENIUS of Agatha Christie: the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness. In addition to her stories, the excellent production values, beautiful locations, wonderful music, top-notch acting, elegant directing, etc. are the reasons for this series' success and timelessness - and all those virtues are present in "After the Funeral". A word of advice: be alert right from the start - there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence! There are some quite unnerving moments as well, in contrast to the peaceful-looking English-countryside locations, and some small touches of humor. A must-see for mystery buffs, and just a very good film in general.

Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. "The Thief of Bagdad" was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me. I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading "The Arabian Nights." I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.<br /><br />Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. Georges Perinal's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor. One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including "A Matter of Life and Death" (aka "Stairway to Heaven") and "The Red Shoes." He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles.<br /><br />As with all great works of art, the beauty of "The Thief of Bagdad" lies in the detail. Every frame has its own magical charm. The story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving. Here is a film that will never grow old.	-5.376863101594306	-3.7523347511285383	-2.1911848267721856	-1.9023685308007794	-1.7042758335674686	-0.3834949170262149	-0.2791423814512606	0.09955639435376398	0.22107902367652793	0.23223161307040743	0.9109777464109561	1.0615939588747432	1.096643085614739	1.112972128907326	1.2018305227282533	1.2110112316721018	1.2927298961792522	1.3025205126242891	1.7279140432535112	2.089507598505706	2.411015525043661	3.048829066505579	3.6183808973130454	3.6481543979603	5.51550412591227	
"In the sweltering summer of 1958, the Deuces, a gang of Brooklyn toughs, find their turf threatened when the leader of a rival gang, the Vipers, is released from prison. Leon (Stephen Dorff), the Deuces' leader, tries to guide his boys through bloody brawls to keep the Vipers out. But when his brother (Brad Renfro) falls into a sultry - and dangerous - relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), the sister of a Viper, and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked, Leon and his gang are plunged into an all-out war to save his brother, his girl - and his neighborhood!" according to the DVD sleeve description. This is definitely no "Basketball Diaries".<br /><br />Think of it as "West Side Story" getting hit over the head with baseball bats and steel pipes, stickball having left Brooklyn with the Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" has some cool Hollywood sets, 1950s cars and soundtrack songs; and, much of it is nicely photographed by John A. Alonzo. The story and direction never get beyond these strengths, which enables the film to peak during its opening minutes, and proceed downhill. The cast looks good when you read the credits, but translates into an ageing, flabby mess of phony pompadours, blood, and Brylcreem and one fright wig. A sense of sadness and regret permeates the production.<br /><br />*** Deuces Wild (5/3/02) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz	-4.37103230748656	-2.208954257827985	-2.0906067897535867	-1.855932714984485	-1.6416976945399036	-1.3934771799272963	-1.0202927036897569	-0.22024605120801605	-0.07212093038731174	-0.06524112679880147	-0.008051809958784462	-0.0025178497046618037	0.051051262052081506	0.1347085711224812	0.39304891905704264	0.590400914343925	0.6957429771484088	0.7294193368715998	0.7514122871890265	0.7925971661716366	1.0129289882372083	1.4000999087219639	1.504016283244056	2.9294191305985566	5.751140239292388	
An obsessive love story, where the characters have been extremely convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors. Specially for Vincent Cassel who wouldn't (at the time it was filmed) be the first character you think of for such a role. And yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluci, beyond the film, during this creation. I can only say, that this film should have been released at it is in the USA, instead of thinking of doing a remake. It is simply so french, almost perverted....and yet so true...this film should stay untouched...<br /><br />A director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop..	-1.7059787735474106	-1.1855595786369877	-0.9773420249653213	-0.6941628140490194	-0.6764232638311792	-0.4939543688068716	-0.4219364864103476	-0.3614834074160435	-0.26769539758127425	-0.1297996427729901	-0.12502990335140363	-0.04841257214306191	-0.040921050029684575	0.05176273013660293	0.23565115383668364	0.2670300962486637	0.29763987833628336	0.3107849370333219	0.3476770834457771	0.3790984308664048	0.39502899887028214	0.4062487312920911	0.9891528590812769	1.4192160769284723	1.9030943127301372	
This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. That is no exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it.<br /><br />I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does Erwin/Elvira suicides at the end, but instead of this, in every scene somebody is trying to explain: "when he was young, this happened..." and "he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there...", etc.<br /><br />Soon in the movie, Erwin/Elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute (certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while telling her the story of Elvira's life, Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other. It is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying. Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of "I have suffered much in my life, and am about to die".<br /><br />In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something, Erwin/Elvira encounters a former lover, that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys (as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes Elvira.<br /><br />There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit (such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinder's self- indulgence.	-3.909162259692549	-2.209651400255067	-2.0578388413622046	-2.0157896659945	-1.6669236440111974	-1.4179636112139784	-1.3498175215897141	-0.45963669635365245	-0.08190448932341167	-0.0665048008680179	0.0036572477370402784	0.04921404860824714	0.05870587094333021	0.062452332382774256	0.08920309087104915	0.24883303640253898	0.3345659458454726	0.3918938005296294	0.46725962411443844	0.528272769980872	0.6204625672772021	1.0684305408164938	1.4395167498256405	2.1464967028654187	4.636946209376283	
By Randolph Scott standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointing and heavy-handed star western. Two or three of the characters could be dispensed with, while two or three other characters could be given more prominence. (The humour needs to be completely rewritten.) De Toth handles the action well - as always - but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak.	-2.3357600922809976	-1.0683987647449127	-0.8787777430011712	-0.8514365398007969	-0.7638262611269011	-0.7277841274071959	-0.5508300193421694	-0.3217108416985859	-0.31620036854274325	-0.17549967156424423	-0.14122403169579734	-0.12116614510778603	-0.10255354283471868	-0.09655410231618129	-0.06767914378094336	0.09846000398017193	0.12245834795415761	0.23690156942036508	0.23975010724826187	0.3711763728307555	0.39280503648805837	0.4081444222074023	0.9528828598337838	1.3509980288060517	2.3114298856904503	
good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. but the main point again as his movies tend to be, the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold. nana patekar. this may be his second best performance after parinda( others may disagree). although other movies are not far behind. one man that will never ever disappoint you.<br /><br />good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without. you can see in his movies, others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins. but this man is really something elase.<br /><br />the movie is cool, the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good. a must watch.	-2.455791518683168	-2.234346807447187	-1.40755105970407	-0.8577635069871388	-0.5922629390944802	-0.3659160081956026	-0.13611521700463602	-0.023773425404377005	0.015652521378807224	0.06980463370666994	0.14571513633747557	0.18858537299515218	0.2469209365024583	0.36119292492414723	0.36312835397713283	0.46556136029192186	0.6447151239933744	0.6668876493880314	0.8284880090233521	0.91389206389214	1.1517895546117405	1.6665756830981873	1.9926523807593064	2.4832864169042788	2.6097783260745118	
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Whoops, we made a mistake. It seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart. The actors were picked up at a Salvation Army, and as for Steven Tyler. We will just leave that to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT While watching the movie there is absolutely no closure at all. Then come to find out all the events were just a dream. This movie should also have been about 30 minutes. If all the camera zooms on still shots, and scans of walls were taken out, it would have been much shorter. All I can say is I'm glad there wasnt a sequel.	-6.7822797008387745	-2.77137001739574	-2.581605981704391	-2.546907818021591	-2.1597315865748263	-1.9292182583213644	-1.546426342366135	-1.2742872107422785	-0.5356033517429171	-0.42340685510473053	-0.4121910396345746	-0.2556776989748751	0.14376315698637468	0.3019864155389186	0.5442321247841203	0.6758019079857285	0.6990574724163046	0.7840038413438162	1.0630199141278185	1.133427317724135	1.2860967214231398	1.3567724106489543	2.788957966653626	3.105771442307125	7.105183332623067	
At the beginning of the film, you might double-check the DVD cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries. It's NOT "Memoirs of a Geisha" that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be. Still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery. He decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri (ritual suicide through disembowelment). Cut to present day, when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago. From then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional. Let's start with the good aspects, namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my all-time favorite British horror wench (well, together with Britt Eckland, Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt). The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter. The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff. The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress! In this "possessed" state, she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests. So, strictly spoken, it's not really "evil" that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands! Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in "Ghostbusters". "The House Where Evil Dwells" is probably the least scary ghost movie ever. Throughout most of the running time, you'll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor (who nevertheless made the excellent horror films "Motel Hell" and "From Beyond the Grave") intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top, like "Motel Hell" maybe. But then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face, so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed. "The House Where Evil Dwells" is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning. I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights. Well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders (or are they crabs?) in the daughter's bedroom. How totally random and irrelevant was that? If you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.<br /><br />Trivia note for horror buffs: keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba.	-7.368405608461211	-5.077688612116865	-4.830975855794994	-4.806251393187797	-3.3166873723916614	-2.6406565375152176	-2.289837475138839	-1.148052427584194	-0.9464408241401072	-0.6145891601306812	-0.46049351465041793	-0.29281847060666494	0.2851407040840745	0.33774167328692006	0.41779324852820976	0.7332908156820775	0.812039228965152	0.9824349693928134	1.1483344538155495	1.67763561083262	1.7425101087515507	2.2876637192408973	3.5885913944997445	6.494227907771903	10.720280216759498	
Looks as if the Robocop writer has been wholesale looting The Vindicator. This is a very solid horror/action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiment. Anyone who have seen Robocop knows the story. Watch out for Pam Grier as a bitchy and darn good looking assassin. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not be to everyones liking, but this Canadian outing is well worth seeking out for anyone who is fan of the genre. 8/10	-1.0529968053419654	-0.828050261859298	-0.6225954723277192	-0.6171171700631478	-0.32421012001619537	-0.31257717935824525	-0.22559732522015813	-0.2065390116920718	-0.16061868585840705	-0.09088181020881371	-0.08513859769754971	-0.0592897018582322	-0.056974419155061844	-0.049533350195017686	0.028417817433686234	0.05126851705412748	0.05237679632774269	0.2722357348852788	0.47820085962128744	0.5080931498030177	0.5575898752915345	0.7442878116391486	0.7491491568641011	1.008666034538085	1.14404162772233	
I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, I found it thoroughly entertaining.I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think I'm odd but there you are. "I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God.It is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's a classic,it cannot be done without Ron.(like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.	-2.1465056316891733	-1.2682242299348183	-1.1458196729964176	-1.0895249882486935	-0.9907326129607582	-0.5972627538183171	-0.5277768081592291	-0.39681702015781933	-0.2806701626546596	-0.13192581467126246	-0.09395733159677015	-0.02432709989772474	0.0030241457448370312	0.008716839062231974	0.011677234353088761	0.0436203847302704	0.09932962809169278	0.3862920730000916	0.40903711199262405	0.4127384332568921	0.5022275789248488	0.5084034097350226	0.803147135887346	1.5338445925247635	2.5746651558529146	
Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera "direction" needs serious reworking. And no more "hold the camera and run" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad.

I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep, they're lesbians! Nothing rings true in this "Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do" movie. Clunky dialogue like "I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn't take it" doesn't help. There's a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliche is left unturned.	-4.83014321155596	-2.685631024274053	-1.7841683854756833	-1.5789139705138728	-1.2123314568537382	-1.069343101857906	-0.7385473931564234	-0.6295489994856004	-0.536715464907021	-0.3315884976638859	-0.17643151636474685	-0.14761968895567962	-0.0831829173599177	0.031666109643996576	0.30834715234390964	0.425010379046177	0.44400934333302966	0.7589772223716961	0.7911084653235964	1.0951616571311977	1.1207509022209101	1.2391730926284046	1.3044011373450677	2.5111101527020634	5.054855907264677	
This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bums".<br /><br />My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a "walk". The end result was straight out of Monty Python's "Ministry of Silly Walks" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough.<br /><br />And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV since Rosie O'Donnell left "The View". As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. I've never found her attractive, and I don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.<br /><br />Someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.	-3.9904473758009726	-2.115407419052828	-1.6534596494357263	-1.4963116050637724	-1.3096256867920884	-0.9390942930951758	-0.7427334539903121	-0.7333942311144365	-0.5343278464215147	-0.42499501667671974	-0.3606708013469224	-0.3347136946937702	-0.02081449404400433	0.04020077419754234	0.04772325086042649	0.1316983689808011	0.18917800332666834	0.19386240002002814	0.7181483134098274	0.8369120815723845	0.9329843612046258	0.9589226894665746	1.127222927678402	2.1525744531013005	3.95112934282898	
A lot of people unfairly sh!t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining. Devil's Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work--not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic--especially for the video's vintage and low-budget.<br /><br />Let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know: This film is an "extreme" torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid-80s. It's plot as it stands is simple: A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. This entails brutal violence--all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.<br /><br />The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.<br /><br />The actress who plays the victim of the "experiment" is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera. Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling. Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot. 8.5/10 for Devil's Experiment.	-4.4958908564764135	-2.4939634414434884	-2.2679661003925347	-1.74628019496031	-1.5851685738830346	-0.9235922593447304	-0.4629455069244391	-0.28606232735766984	-0.24922553703223044	-0.21713330059337269	-0.20918860231001535	-0.18978066375812144	-0.09500190620054394	0.019537464888194522	0.2511938447639477	0.3167303830547726	0.6653552420921608	0.8880341757097279	0.9263986557578864	0.9922991395584482	1.0574402971569734	1.1214650511453865	1.127690813971934	2.8572740601921085	5.323440667020852	
This film has some flaws, and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening. Possibly the greatest film to show the direness within Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody. Like life, it starts, it moves, and then it ends. A few attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie. This is free and repeatedly frequently on Comedy Central because nobody went to see it, nobody wants to see it, and it's marginally better than dead air. Not to damn with faint praise, but the movie's one rock song is worth listening to. Too bad the movie isn't worth watching.	-3.469090519226501	-2.189231197569952	-2.100752022806404	-1.9370964322978654	-1.885463251371971	-0.9710014680640655	-0.5216700354844968	-0.49243657222064313	-0.4343313244890223	-0.3984151752948143	-0.3571698494067939	-0.2879332730407004	-0.004500528761246875	0.010669592630846408	0.054707322747319265	0.07949723429720142	0.3645207314331701	0.4636586926334806	0.5244709112573097	0.6503321364266677	0.9824133569731248	0.9918278555450114	1.3809877050820654	2.4170361103171984	4.448229060874669	
This movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch, I mean it wasn't great but it was one of the better horror movies of late. It seems to have been low, almost state benefit budget size but it has it's charms like the lovely ladies in it. The atmosphere was good also (which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days). The acting was your typical 80's low budget affair, that being in case you don't know is that it is "dud" acting. But that is what Lucio Fulci's movies were full of, they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc. They more than made up for in the horror & gore & atmosphere for the movie it's self.<br /><br />It is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable, I watched it all the way and I love horror movies. I've seen movies where I just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward it if it's on video, or skip scene's on the DVD. This movie didn't make me want to do that, I sat and watched it all the way to the end, without wanting to skip parts.<br /><br />I would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having Freddy Kreuger as your babysitter, not. But seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection, maybe.<br /><br />The music in this movie was top notch stuff, ideal horror music so it was. I've seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better, thank goodness though this movie didn't have nay of the Metal music in it.<br /><br />I've been a die-hard Metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music spoils it, the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing. So i'm glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy, well done.<br /><br />It could have use "Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams" on it though. As it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except "really" creepy keyboard tracks. Like track one "Forever Sleep" you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it. Ever track on that cd is the same, ideal horror music at it's best, it would have suited this movie perfectly.<br /><br />The only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed/killed (or so we are led to believe) and hung up as a scarecrow, only to get free and try to escape later. Every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed, a big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one I mentioned above.<br /><br />I wish that Hollywood (mainstream side of things) would give money to Romero and the guy who made this movie. As giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called Paul Anderson of the "resident evil" mince.<br /><br />Well done guys, it is not bad, not bad at all, I loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie (behind the scene's) Not many movies do this kind of thing, which I thought added a little to the movie, as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me.<br /><br />Rating for this movie 8/10, rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9/10, rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9/10, rating for the score for the film 9.5/10.	-11.306500491758351	-5.8946904668708875	-5.811246009996632	-5.591068964568873	-4.591435215088188	-3.4837842837090895	-3.021686220329939	-1.0957628187989685	-0.686785297797537	-0.6390298697397482	-0.4927862450970726	-0.39618803777374206	-0.3716918817921303	0.467060551744776	1.0153131548748642	1.2067733222818477	1.6301421550712107	1.7875382632560477	1.9432154082708462	2.01159884453249	2.426514305312161	2.7420405404133135	3.0986854726857804	7.319398679421383	13.572774055463965	
Take a cliché story and insert Steve Guttenberg.Need i say anymore?This truly is as bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer(Guttenberg)and Anna Montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless,inept kids into a winning soccer team.Lacking originality and direction from the offset it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than Guttenbergs.Previously unimaginable i thought. This type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called 'film'	-2.017732824645737	-0.856950935048167	-0.8556063504739237	-0.8196954972247088	-0.8069079076518222	-0.6624422429565848	-0.36209957831439127	-0.3617446673670607	-0.32965534520283857	-0.2332498939015919	-0.23228840293562708	-0.0922957777421492	0.016329340851127097	0.02753752934771167	0.11857662815212269	0.2525348406835528	0.2578444732906226	0.29495456903214695	0.32394435900092805	0.34075265048772774	0.3440631647296726	0.37736563670794354	0.654318812444214	0.9222886382567618	2.3705985045809688	
I have yet to watch STARCRASH (1979) - that notoriously cheesy Italian take on STAR WARS (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which, suffice it to say, makes Mel Brooks' so-so SPACEBALLS (1987) look like a veritable work of art! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! <br /><br />Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet or other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either.<br /><br />Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here), a long-eared, wing-sporting colored guy, a pot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, "What is this s**t?" There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto!<br /><br />For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their "Lord". God(awful) indeed...	-5.71155211832952	-2.906110085004316	-2.582955088512085	-2.5802829586009786	-2.550847070840304	-1.5375921670960813	-0.6903530572291406	-0.5314529797119705	-0.511786826581767	-0.47568524269461243	-0.40415008159414256	-0.3313290309499195	-0.24330692234475376	-0.2018674706115966	-0.15598770993854277	0.18462352240572893	0.26838754375697804	0.3144408829932876	0.6609690654982595	0.8187625741667166	0.8334070776842623	1.0360663019083327	2.536679736760091	3.0330178622197437	5.922275279429809	
In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood. What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.<br /><br />Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area. No-one believed them. Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact. The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing. The Chamberlain's trial was over before it began.<br /><br />Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation even sit in judgement? From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know? Unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the Chamberlains should have been acquitted.<br /><br />Fred Schepisi's film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Bryson's novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them. That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock.<br /><br />Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light. He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay! His screenplay, co-written with Robert Caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred.<br /><br />The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts. She brings to life most convincingly the tough little Aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight. Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on. A very good effort by the master of that trade. Sam Neill is every bit as good as Streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned Michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart, and he starts to question his Christianity. His, as was Streep's, is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly. The entire support cast are also excellent, with some of Australia's finest actors and actresses playing a part.<br /><br />Technically the film is brilliant too, with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendour (especially the Rock). Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a telling score.<br /><br />For all Aussies this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you will, at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served, and the truth to be known. As Michael Chamberlain said : "I don't think anybody really understands what innocence means.....to innocent people."<br /><br />Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video<br /><br />Even on return viewings Fred Schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that befell the Chamberlains, who lost baby Azaria at Ayres rock in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving.<br /><br />Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred John Bryson's novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose new born daughter Azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down.<br /><br />Amid media speculation and vicious public rumour Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact. What followed was little more than trial by media, and with the Australian people determined she be put away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence. She is truly awesome, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent, though she does her level best to sound ocker. You might wonder why a top Australian actress wasn't cast in the role, but star power is probably the answer. Alongside Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels powerless to do anything about it. A strong Aussie cast lend compelling support.<br /><br />Editing from Jill Bilcock is very timely, Ian Baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the part. Truly a must for all conscientious Australians.<br /><br />Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video	-6.481134793198656	-6.288375767814956	-5.210497300105776	-4.968486355575041	-2.7481823142810566	-2.6022647726584935	-1.490858220217965	-1.244039889328621	-1.1377275865432017	0.3613363970490636	0.825254080954421	0.9522875560551949	1.0534122878912286	1.6547654563739078	2.1482299257366324	2.1575793358190802	2.3180979107340245	2.3398033904560096	2.900804952100213	3.0325949834831665	4.0492634377887375	4.545563330324135	7.925117607669257	9.272340322318533	13.391778446111996	
President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you don't know.<br /><br />Seven years before Richard Rhodes' superb Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Making of the Atomic Bomb", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, "Oppenheimer", that was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the Atomic Age, permanently joining science and technology to the state (and, in particular, the military), not merely making history, but changing the world forever.<br /><br />The production is impeccable, the casting nothing short of miraculous; not only the main characters, but even secondary characters bear uncanny resemblances to the persons portrayed. In particular are Sam Waterston in the title role of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, who was based at the Los Alamos, NM, laboratory (the site for which he personally chose); Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the project's formal name); David Suchet as physicist, and ultimate nemesis of Oppenheimer, Edward Teller (who, nearly forty years later, whispered into Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - "Star Wars") and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. The attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout.<br /><br />Part thriller, part love story - and ultimately a tragedy, this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history - and that of science - that we dare not forget. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />(NOTE: Viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series "The Ascent of Man" and the BBC film of Michael Frayn's play "Copenhagen".)	-1.5518360911985212	-1.3671083253951768	-1.2716103092426123	-0.9319076913458074	-0.8191932407432121	-0.585504433707963	-0.38493766637134363	-0.3197449623374513	-0.23179676425906376	-0.17449875347595953	-0.16072480096837768	-0.03129856588623515	0.06664597851559323	0.09272965679539039	0.10770655672121911	0.1893616888881628	0.31272640693896164	0.324196907341595	0.48925799615399745	0.6835902980825211	0.7036185608479646	0.9154177039597877	1.2552199825926227	1.8635631871271943	3.076427889000396	
When Sam Peckinpah's superlative THE WILD BUNCH (1969) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence, it did so with a talented (if whisky-marinated) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth, but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpah's epic, and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that category.<br /><br />SOLDIER BLEW, er, BLUE tells the story of foul-mouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee (Candice Bergen) a blonde proto-hippie chick who's been "rescued" from two years of "captivity" among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she'll be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money. Also on board the wagon she's traveling in is a shipment of government gold, cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with, so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills, accompanied by Honus Gant (Peter Strauss), the lone surviving cavalryman. Calling Gant by the snarky nickname "Soldier Blue," Cresta demonstrates that her years among the "savages" was time well spent, outstripping Gant in survival skills, common sense, and sheer balls, and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements, a band of hostile Kiowa, an unscrupulous trader  played by Donald Pleasance, here giving one of his most ridiculous performances, and that's saying something  and, in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies, each other.<br /><br />During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while Gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg, no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn't filled with rattlesnakes, mountain lions, or who knows what, to say nothing of the Cheyenne, who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment (there I go, thinking in NYC real estate terms again). <br /><br />Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave, Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village, and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of what's coming. <br /><br />What happens next is what gained the film its infamy; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre, an orgy of rape, torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of "keeping the country clean," and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty. Children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets, unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect, I have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes, then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight, so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts, which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered, their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs. No joke, this scene would instantly garner an NC-17 rating if released today, to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted.<br /><br />I'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won, or stolen if truth be told, but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be; one minute it's a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up (well, DUH!), then it's a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho (with no undies), but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally (?) hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere, all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax. Any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film, but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery. <br /><br />But by trying to be all things to all audiences, SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent, preachy Mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness, but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre, wouldn't it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece? We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing "the most savage film in history." If you, like me, were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its "daring to tell it like it was," take my word for it and let SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into cinematic obscurity.	-9.991889441047402	-5.80253897958553	-5.4506027939146575	-5.084776645024581	-4.788589545094116	-2.1551734741436412	-1.407484802463734	-1.35610108297355	-1.0880769580831728	-1.0418189395249609	-0.9834779515843297	-0.8961446505025301	-0.051024280499673544	0.04736822537677268	0.19495648672889487	0.23545066710148876	0.7872962673874659	1.0144051549420834	1.3312321729682177	1.5345060081978499	1.861155952675885	2.401755357057201	3.316619546412481	5.553466823482962	10.412048901299555	
Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen. I experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as I was gunning for the two leads to reunite. That never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. But the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. It is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. As of now I haven't rewatched the movie and I don't think I will.<br /><br />The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to be married to Muriel. He remembers his old girlfriend Lisa(he considers this the love of his life) as he listens, by accident, to Lisa talking on the telephone. Thus he tries to find Lisa. Here starts his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers to this movie. There are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion. The movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. It is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. It has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of grey and I felt the ending was perfect. I don't think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with Alice.<br /><br />The character of Alice is even worse. Her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers(that is the point, I guess). The scene where she breaks down in front of Lucien really shows another facet of her character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. The ending lends a cynical touch. Because it seems as if Max's love for Alice is temporary and fake. It is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option(i.e Muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting(i.e Lisa or Alice). In many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance(in a way).<br /><br />The performances deserve high praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance. He perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement. His geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene where she screams "I am a nutcase too" really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her.<br /><br />Btw I also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be far-fetched considering she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids questions from Lisa regarding a boyfriend. She spends a whole lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during that time. That may lead many to question her sexual orientation.<br /><br />Overall I would give it a 9/10. I think it deserves it but I subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor. I think it is a perfect movie otherwise.	-10.500624544019345	-8.709204850680228	-8.250077075645654	-5.917913027184974	-3.1183059600544984	-2.6350353823032147	-2.6183888373644417	-0.6535260959882472	-0.5685880280623861	-0.4924713136816778	-0.23963857802356164	0.13767165281969862	0.7158735834468792	0.9364669165512813	1.3788873512297515	2.0380295297024165	2.140745623453468	2.2829670208867707	2.799667781622762	3.136457856255364	4.147744926860716	4.255562739827193	9.630256123858226	10.549292026774202	17.47910361507338	
Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.<br /><br />Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century, 1945 to be exact, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. But it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.<br /><br />Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom, loathing, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars. She endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity. I wish some really good parts come along for her. She really deserves it.	-2.771988771588174	-2.626890057220201	-2.32176723470528	-2.068551931641253	-1.474346592772968	-1.259045269158836	-0.567660983849481	-0.11457037212776613	-0.03326523825974723	0.19903257343328745	0.24708354258488677	0.2914553452327016	0.4886743112663252	0.4918179242466508	0.6411377070799872	0.7216213343748052	0.9070468264831288	1.1454775777851887	1.355738639751549	1.3571098069441112	1.445013372131221	1.6184593733977024	3.5552492467015173	4.118001068908392	4.527479368645505	
After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are You, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that spoilt Scooby-Doo success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo that made this show a complete failure, probably for both adults and kids together. Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up. Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should have either killed or never thought up Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids will prefer it!	-3.075869599474115	-2.4693649197174525	-1.578657132088836	-1.5196378861032382	-1.2309188005478777	-1.0051703079101875	-0.6449436969904967	-0.3655739749379583	-0.21812016843106452	-0.21049280557576716	-0.1998497203202661	-0.18145524954587144	-0.1499257954303991	-0.02069100303797189	0.19737524998817238	0.2717589713346715	0.48599056948252356	0.5874125827435137	0.7298368069111277	0.8543513978582932	0.8757814219150186	0.9320634028267711	1.2540893688486008	1.5742964562913304	4.2897480033863395	
This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) of its predecessors ("Death On The Nile", "Evil Under The Sun") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as screen detectives go (of course, he is playing a character much less interesting than Poirot). The film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of Christie's plot alone (all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat.

First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that I rented it, I wanted to like it.<br /><br />I think that the main reason that I was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller. In my eyes, a suspense thriller for British movies is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.<br /><br />This movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. We have our main character, that suspects a man that he does not like, of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.His notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.<br /><br />The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place, at this point, but from there, I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. The film might have been enjoyable to me, if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.This seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. I felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized. So, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.	-3.862947620885331	-2.314956274912708	-2.3037400226395808	-1.9510576449465231	-1.683937115183844	-1.5385880795868991	-1.08099638437541	-0.5371896381433182	-0.44076392730878083	-0.3689931749729708	-0.2260095142983438	-0.03572194273232221	-0.025795557769530186	0.34850611763743167	0.37775459257046096	0.4409122784613753	0.4535148542865682	0.5610808557936228	0.6889401287918084	0.7349969430737963	0.818104511533532	0.871545949238867	1.1889774892838856	2.876122379720219	4.8663927305184504	
"A scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters, occurring across the globe. Hoping to discover the source of these signals and who's behind them, the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals. What the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Kirk Scott (as Andrew Boran) is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer. He suspects a series of "Large Earth Disruptions" may be connected to the weird space static. Mr. Scott and pretty blonde wife Sue Lyon (as Sylvia Boran) investigate the mysterious signals from outer space. They discover priestly, but creepy Christopher Lee (as "Father Pergado"), and other silliness. Given that, "End of the World" is remarkably dull. <br /><br />*** End of the World (1977) John Hayes ~ Kirk Scott, Sue Lyon, Christopher Lee	-4.357429028163642	-1.819688787501913	-1.5668640529854772	-1.4176490355459586	-1.3609446934877243	-1.2427117955334932	-0.6654164011549649	-0.4735641418407537	-0.44863868019513364	-0.42365749626699045	-0.3798923429585588	0.12875496830181443	0.1481222665085682	0.17059119652266874	0.39416600782751804	0.41671196206362476	0.42712733577240547	0.4324023584140537	0.4714329979557127	0.48741731605049166	0.7382554974932246	0.8378753940865968	1.5196723083051311	1.9772117498608401	4.586528447684417	
This movie had very few moments of real drama. After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. The acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist. The collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day Mr Russo signed up for this one. Do I speak Latin? Et tu Brutus.	-2.9332053932947932	-1.3638529900682699	-1.0409452311428709	-0.9247885975906772	-0.7662044976071325	-0.7101110099563315	-0.6997256120009545	-0.5100498090416228	-0.3490544743968173	-0.33514852027219627	-0.3042927675727434	-0.13297266517550094	-0.12722239305482216	-0.06893915652540465	0.15320428075347892	0.15681887921705914	0.23695635108310675	0.28078269485157564	0.3736276013573766	0.411825785706963	0.4678445919949926	0.9246774605770307	1.1980853387234598	1.2298732719656735	2.6046618752990196	
Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I wonder how much of a hand Hongsheng had in developing the film. I mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, I would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased.<br /><br />But...his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been told from Hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. They saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.<br /><br />As for Hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the Jesus Christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his family's happiness. Huh?<br /><br />The viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. He lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to the side.<br /><br />It's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. He went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />This same device is used in Ted Demme's "Blow" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.<br /><br />However, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. But, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. It makes the viewer feel as if Hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many difficult parts.	-2.6475456612478547	-2.2864256702371106	-2.1132803275744774	-1.8119534727343778	-1.4702221176200554	-1.1493728514448727	-1.109915743867808	-0.43172877968502194	-0.280184686982591	-0.23628113200135903	-0.19336470169353323	-0.1733027917323413	-0.13104487752025393	-0.10100206013471397	0.41795757958443247	0.5960748662212136	0.7937212366477038	0.983766606901221	1.030803277719426	1.0558336374586923	1.3442173464200824	1.3984266556866956	2.7197719315586455	2.9744752781289363	5.202972372193407	
This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched. At the age of 12 I was up late and ran across the movie. It was on the USA channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At the time my friends and I were really struggling with different issues, some sexual. You know 12 is a very rough and weird age. It seems you are stuck in between being a little girl, and being a young lady. This movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me. I now have a daughter that is 12. Have been searching for a couple years for this movie. If it ever does come out on DVD I would be the first to buy. Would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age.	-3.504949046454937	-2.35881422126461	-1.8418155541713508	-1.1215496650058807	-1.05952167081219	-0.3358688701294575	-0.2674977879987466	-0.14509447341566645	-0.09474080927277845	-0.0656662974578817	-0.021418680643197588	0.04817278402519411	0.053130348635763186	0.13502961794439833	0.17056210626304896	0.18623328814152024	0.3365368173580736	0.4014553884851422	0.5913364695105892	0.8712835505235474	0.9600954601177331	1.0745621296577996	2.0850492346255627	2.4320327711387737	4.053340340309195	
I feel totally ripped off. Someone needs to refund the $4.95 I spent at Blockbuster to rent this homemade mess. This is NOT a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening. What I don't get is why did this get distributed in the first place???...somebody MUST have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made. I've seen better films come out of film schools and I have been to film school so I can say that as a fact. The quality of this work is also just SO VERY bad to view...shot on DV??? Nuff said. The songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section. Want to see a good musical? THEN DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE.	-4.243933178802512	-1.9906815719369138	-1.9525015433270434	-1.9020770709845911	-1.4458673877368293	-1.4084646238123224	-0.9900063254292839	-0.23551086556346032	-0.16128774768524656	-0.09267245401561372	0.032496771580886555	0.14726413411470002	0.15069988374089022	0.1825601446521028	0.2639351049253558	0.38378740639654396	0.5501213340925444	0.6390176936786883	0.6497044270725836	0.7435969406080126	1.0389654362520602	1.3754219906430503	1.3964711690734068	2.702080016227554	5.706079440327687	
Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target.<br /><br />Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who didn't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.<br /><br />This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.	-6.274670159760553	-3.5984610935639694	-3.259425240411728	-2.7547163544970092	-2.619544777622468	-1.9661540970800395	-1.627375284186979	-0.5867415406725456	-0.5383101511465548	-0.4908477742350983	-0.31283288565999523	-0.19899489627037617	0.010370967076670064	0.3231584869343608	0.5692954498870754	0.6983644512172306	0.8627768763145285	0.8642977412046506	0.8792934667744224	0.888357617120641	1.1292648182238092	1.2171956436541511	1.6172124835032258	4.192870464826567	7.168484636027068	
I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in India. The language, the stark treatment and the natural acting (by a relatively unknown cast for that time) might have been even more shocking at that time for an Indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema. The film, the cast, and Shekhar Kapoor, deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort.<br /><br />The plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in India. In fact, there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself. The reason why this stands out is that it's supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this, and a lot else that doesn't find place on the screen, and survived to tell the tale. Survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least. Phoolan Devi didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994.<br /><br />The film scores on several counts. The cinematography is brilliant. The music is apt. The cast, many of whom became more familiar names later, is very good. But the screenplay is patchy. Things move too fast and in jerks at times. It's understandable though, because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive. Or maybe I felt that because I have read Mala Sen's book, which is a more detailed and better, though obviously not as shocking as the visual, account of Phoolan Devi's travails, and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film.<br /><br />There are some factual ambiguities too. According to Phoolan Devi, she wasn't present when the Behmai massacre took place, and despite claiming to be the dictated account of Phoolan herself, she is shown to participate, and in fact initiate, the massacre. Then the final scene where Phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the Chief Minister, while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Symbolic value only, but shows that Phoolan didn't want to show servitude to a living, ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the Chief Minister to have some resemblance to Arjun Singh, who many remember was the CM of Madhya Pradesh then.<br /><br />But these are small chinks in this eminently well-made movie, a rare gem to come out from the mainstream Indian film industry, made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late 80s - Mr India.	-6.724821370728182	-3.8448743583134006	-3.6669831875248198	-3.257367547930017	-2.1654060077969923	-2.0411164007129945	-1.7129718986556388	-0.35932596731891275	-0.16989589576911135	-0.11586430628658029	0.21860692321833639	0.2712773633833638	0.3869230481177941	0.4718592904311025	0.5016310076335326	0.668061001592779	0.8615653894496041	0.8932434990388347	1.4591378755466538	1.600299322199687	1.7142425074017058	1.726049688253636	3.207722365598142	4.528738473287124	9.70362951505266	
The filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic. I liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's Chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions - I felt I could get a real sense of the times, recreated even in splendid shots of traditional Chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living. It seemed worthwhile to experience. The interwoven role which Buddhism plays is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect, perhaps the most effective that I've seen in Chinese film. Casting is great. Images are memorable. Acting is solid enough. Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.	-4.756362297090564	-2.271955057233317	-1.6275677304272793	-0.9601508749150849	-0.8130256944939447	-0.4092009758089922	-0.394375431927617	-0.3434246618229436	-0.23857145100523183	0.431297708029259	0.6225004930352518	0.6474621632590656	0.7172287951082077	0.9673978966731349	1.0643724251534976	1.082102388302737	1.2894518960933397	1.5246975755095962	1.5324992944258364	1.5549208777858041	1.6670116223691471	1.7883565910029127	1.796091421028723	3.3451088692382918	3.9878532796872452	
I really like this movie. I like it not just because it's a great early 80s movie with a GREAT soundtrack but I found that it has some thought-provoking moments. They are just moments; not the entire film. It's definitely not like "Less than Zero".<br /><br />The scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems, like the betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters. Certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one's own teenage experiences and how those experiences may have affected one's character and outlook as an adult.<br /><br />You can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults must face, and about your own experiences. Or you can just pay attention to the boys' quest to de-virginize themselves! :) Either way it's a good movie.	-1.6439667016296315	-1.4661488545500019	-1.4382129431294293	-1.2030224556955502	-0.7788410625227625	-0.6230287084978138	-0.6130697327014505	-0.3936576373719599	-0.3014678796435206	-0.2810146627434517	-0.20487918994250107	-0.19756265639368212	-0.11209457744359738	0.06753745948493939	0.1659782595580504	0.20081684951034903	0.20301491059981513	0.3452563532059022	0.43723660167745004	0.5877734791569966	0.8402055499703524	0.8405097970854422	1.53074460303222	1.558329703580092	3.119078559596572	
what is wrong with you people, if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica Simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head. Of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. It was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on DVD.

THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE!!!<br /><br />This movie is like a "bad acid trip" for kids under the age of 5. For a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me "Why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?". (And that wasn't the worst of it). We stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing.

I love all types of films, especially horror. That being said, Survival does not live up to ANY of the hype surrounding it.<br /><br />I can't give it any points on originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes, or remaking what others have done. It has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods, a crazed killer, and as of lately, throw in some crazy family. On those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (though the twist in that one is obvious), and others. Survival falls up way short against comparable films. The plot was just not original in ANY way. Some films can get by with a weak (and way over-done) plot with superb acting, special fx, or a slew of other factors. Survivial doesn't have any of that to bank on. If you will, note the following: The acting in the movie never took off. I don't knock or blame the actors for that, nor the director. The dialogue was at best mediocre, and the actors involved never showed (not saying didn't HAVE) the talent to pull it off. I mention 2 standouts. The leading man in this film certainly has the look, but I seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film. The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential, but we never got to see any of it (watch the movie to see why, you won't believe it..).<br /><br />The grainy film look. Ah yes, that little tid-bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of "Grindhouse" films. In today's film making, that has become a gimmick. It either works or it doesn't. In this case it just does not work. There are too many other flaws going on, so it winds up distracting from the film, not adding to it. That being said, I think they did a good job of adding that grain. That is some good, quality grain. I think with a different script, better direction, and possibly actors, they should try another "Grindhouse" attempt. They will probably pull it off.<br /><br />As far as the tech aspects, in my opinion, they never quite gelled for me either. Better care could have been taken with audio (sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that) and for being shot on DV, it was too soft for my taste.<br /><br />That is all I have to say about that.....	-11.528199878216164	-5.996816187388353	-5.4800994572760455	-4.968675096954046	-3.8016153313996512	-3.796923150881577	-3.5018900901413508	-1.1996296322770978	-1.0138976766163963	-1.0099936443847226	-0.6216284196988188	-0.1026130361958974	0.0708259926169941	0.7211430393565736	0.7755293957698628	0.7932968675794209	1.067748768374774	1.184458376339927	1.5850121849679706	2.102144561355344	2.3250546165331856	2.9221904724189045	3.222728201606759	6.94848117378654	13.975202773057706	
I was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. That is, a twenty-something guy flops in the Big Apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It just might have worked but there's a problem. And that problem's name is Casey Affleck. <br /><br />Casey Affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. His acting mantra must be "exert as little effort as possible at all times". Or "why speak when you can mutter?" Or maybe "put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls". Lips moving when speaking? Barely. Facial expressions? None. Muscles in face? Atrophied. Something? Nothing. ANYthing?

With Knightly and O'Tool as the leads, this film had good possibilities, and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. It was of course totally superficial, beautiful English country and seaside or not.The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast, and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements.	-2.510449873446819	-0.9628119164708986	-0.9392541714281317	-0.8851392798549056	-0.7645789692967859	-0.6731075580449637	-0.6153000858367318	-0.30245531444391616	-0.221423701135969	-0.04590343624141673	-0.022687031978512462	0.013141215262796394	0.040175307993426	0.05491037872073896	0.07959632637377645	0.1016491185182819	0.1027067145968768	0.22679018717610772	0.23220467044074844	0.2528223278644356	0.2851464915077893	0.4563645801046631	0.9921456881286644	1.4114969683550265	2.6366800686602136	
At what point does a film become so bad it's good? Compelling in it's awfulness, Darkhunters stands out as a shining example of c**p cinematography and for that alone, probably deserves some kind of award.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the age old battle of Heaven and Hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead. In the case of Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a herd of cats, a hooded Grim Reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal effect electric fire, a Philip Marlowe-a-like with a seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be on day-release from Kwik-Save.<br /><br />The protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely, a boarding kennels in an attempt to evade his pursuers.<br /><br />The plot is spread thinner than a dieter's sandwich with no character development or attempt to build suspense. The acting is laughable, comparable to a school play - although that would be an insult to many educational establishments. And the dialogue .......... oh, how my sides ached! With the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as "life's unwanted gherkins" by the flame-glow demon, you wonder whether Hell really is a McDonalds.<br /><br />But is is bizarrely compelling, you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get - at just over 80 minutes, it's worth the time spent for the unintentional giggles.	-6.346551617458822	-2.5779563528585228	-2.4912246773628235	-2.4734114896637918	-2.35988282398575	-1.6242529541250366	-0.8471149853401428	-0.7546813142877389	-0.6328618282761633	-0.3826327280009946	-0.30551814355721507	-0.1012341848264664	-0.05562747485069697	0.30872346142034385	0.3327528538883965	0.3689931607611221	0.36985650017524885	0.4898466852011827	0.6772018290358903	0.8204225396815416	1.0264791483054096	1.043591760174115	2.7887795148454497	3.1671053659904014	6.562018346360145	
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today. It is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures". I was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than I think is healthy. A worthwhile moodpiece.	-2.107114353065388	-2.0476498721884333	-1.748288498471637	-1.43990050633044	-1.2415920520334667	-0.8532086827311984	-0.37683594928484754	-0.2007702833271223	-0.1465961439207403	0.032525962673282616	0.07501430163518241	0.17651424866175885	0.4919764026368729	0.506436151244882	0.5724561088900818	0.7602126041872928	0.9196903820557085	0.9588787762565923	0.9755141496777056	0.9758923105884507	1.576877969435376	1.6238879639563615	3.0410017792151622	3.0512179746621086	3.9515986119583175	
Hehehe. This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed so I fell out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCool's.<br /><br />It is about Norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006. And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two, but I do not know. It will be hard beating this one. <br /><br />recommended to everyone! It is a must see film. I was suppose to see it at the cinema, but I had work at the times it where shown. And been trying to rent it for a month, but all the time rented out. Got it today on DVD. Well worth it.	-4.338035116188259	-3.1965960066045542	-3.1923031162370896	-2.662025334438883	-1.4905867804285229	-0.9248159896900041	-0.8241530571764542	-0.6071593961764169	-0.506234383988954	-0.2985411059059694	-0.2523010967007816	-0.19102525591257447	0.19160398954914176	0.21897575684132953	0.559520832331031	0.6320079824106938	1.0156905520610304	1.27793428215426	1.4601441119578653	1.462562671877312	1.79466846728767	2.1356630403185175	4.143494206458223	4.149637018045507	4.495082164477655	
Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl. Do I need to describe any more of the plot to you? The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are two terrific terrifying movies. Classics (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not by a long shot. It's certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of The Exorcist could have been. From start to finish it has the feel of a "made for Sci-Fi channel" production. It's one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar show).<br /><br />The make up and effects were absolutely laughable. The acting was horrendously bad. There was not a single performance that didn't lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as the sheriff. The script wasn't THAT terrible but it certainly wasn't anything special.<br /><br />It seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. Apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room. C'mon. And if your daughter is possessed don't worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices, eat rabbits, try to stare you down, and put fog machines in their bed. Other than that there is nothing to worry about. Apparently she was possessed with a low budget D-List demon.<br /><br />There was none of the ghastly deeds done by A-List demons like crucifix intercourse, painful body distortions, or even projectile vomiting.<br /><br />Totally laughable movie. Not worth even a discount rental.<br /><br />2 out of 10.	-10.338289249529453	-5.374180266130128	-4.269389366468126	-3.8489164398921343	-3.2580723463641585	-2.9407223701794596	-2.640431884455836	-1.3863885549029191	-1.3635782098488325	-0.9041261414606624	-0.5562789911296824	-0.030289038502088805	0.006692572613933131	0.6083963764184749	0.8167810515181071	0.8229659670819217	1.0292695123957125	1.1027849418673317	1.4490670574881144	1.6158322009156438	1.672009671147063	1.908629768065035	3.184446922848111	5.475677986774439	11.169857036967258	
The only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason I felt compelled to finish it out! Basically, I wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens, any UFO's, anything at all suggested by the title of the movie, the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie! I was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was. This could have been used to the movie's advantage, but I felt, instead, that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me! Finally, how big was this cast's wardrobe!? I became so distracted by the number of different, and extremely bright, shirts each character had on in every new scene that I began to wonder if this movie wasn't really supposed to be classified under "poor comedy".<br /><br />toe thumbs down!	-2.8928234436942546	-1.6318275657405674	-1.5575979083228344	-1.4483131539875835	-1.0942285274450076	-1.0701168016427562	-0.8706476521423869	-0.286971400037452	-0.2669038069684779	-0.22149164203308289	-0.02262820904273473	0.04311818672533954	0.07889247977922216	0.08222781139278093	0.08663724487046166	0.29719987424461963	0.3531282629788821	0.42390793253042186	0.5011704778366546	0.5506199198334631	0.6596235732197021	0.6605761471356613	0.6914573325105606	1.9152923301307583	3.3536846404862244	
Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's conviction, based on barely any hard evidence. I love films that question the media, and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system. I've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties. It's not, as has often been said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it engaging.	-1.8311475346469535	-1.4181314831648213	-1.2374206869102988	-1.1162080279511328	-0.5914679164971643	-0.5439184264936832	-0.47818641316870736	-0.2716694550732224	-0.25943672082914654	-0.2544057822704362	-0.20290255825978662	-0.07095058620027722	0.0010809832793795826	0.03167092841288345	0.049616126360782116	0.08538415463099412	0.1593607974615436	0.24566791873631577	0.4142193790177726	0.5526390448603744	0.6853237608910202	1.2470219129058857	1.2784573807482684	1.4798716457032879	2.6218435488066207	
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I've seen a duff film. I guess I'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. So I check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties. Yet maybe I should check the settings for the comments presentation, since after a while the gushing dies down and I'm relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own. I feel vindicated. It IS a rubbish film, it DOESN'T hang together and it DOES constitute a wasted evening sitting through it. Praise be to kindred spirits.	-4.786094364185852	-2.5869843512230988	-2.2563214428647322	-2.1252318780973796	-1.9407504810459377	-1.778840327325737	-1.500009718719571	-0.7457474393295204	-0.36790919644575965	-0.24912898711234532	-0.1287959107381841	-0.010396282584913735	0.021723804707534933	0.1278543506317997	0.2295843954923173	0.36330716056924856	0.43303291347946127	0.55155547310891	0.5630499811167358	0.5779957127538529	0.5888210182531861	0.6601067481712162	1.9568850614650777	3.0160246736655303	5.075631917047095	
I own almost every Seagal movie (yes even ones like this that are low budget), and I must say, this may be the worst, not only of his movies, but of all movies ever made. The only highlight of this film, and only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. it is Seagal, and B. Seagal does have some sweet action sequences, specifically in the store, and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife. Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and don't even bother with a story line, because the storyline not only stunk, but so did the acting, the fact that F-18's and F-14's somehow changed into F-16s, and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Also the Stealth never had to refuel??? And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force stand point. last I checked, Afghanistan has no Air Force, we (USA) control the skies. Also, this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room, yet the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret. Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck, to the top? PLease tell us why they jailed him, Since when are Air Force pilots great commandos (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries, considering Muslims don't drink alcohol? Also on top of that, since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like the #2 in charge? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.	-6.509843810716111	-2.820434295653511	-2.7456188129970514	-2.7227510253677347	-2.67332401281455	-1.6806658720256578	-0.9818698201366428	-0.8506804291476269	-0.4952560093916245	-0.4525932148787838	-0.3868408674942475	-0.3703708432957873	-0.06973734149694841	-0.027484904493864815	0.3411632558827453	0.36407060616434317	0.4524553833629965	0.6094038200307896	0.7603785035891011	0.8185899115632074	0.929964641379148	0.948875254601522	3.126384000815718	3.143248998421665	6.773540300953074	
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions. All films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense. <br /><br />To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland must be an amazing actor because he manages to look good in spite of bad directing and bad writing; his performance is believable and he manages to stay in character in spite of everything. <br /><br />If Dame Agatha Christie were alive she would die laughing! The movie is that bad!	-3.609168005475933	-2.255227092670368	-1.9829668156482323	-1.8253275741245707	-1.7870126052928488	-1.303859017282463	-0.9999472804223457	-0.6273926540082858	-0.489414103967917	-0.435392470169601	-0.28489664428961925	-0.20040536169882614	0.15654110316776165	0.20642543155750329	0.32221261367341764	0.416184895648267	0.4340719548263705	0.48360296009136455	0.5384806573502919	0.574739499119015	0.6532195225283092	0.8864879247060403	1.2827474030913282	2.8432808215703265	4.5929767753569735	
SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough guy/pretty boy act, and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot chick Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective, coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona. Translation: cable TV filler. There isn't enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasure.<br /><br />The script has some gaping holes. Best/Worst Moment: In one jarring scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot, or words to that effect. This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released, it is truly appalling, and therefore entertaining in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so startled that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. Now THAT'S a Guilty Pleasure.

I got this on a double feature DVD called "Scream Theater" and it's no doubt one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. And I've seen some really bad ones. School's out, and of three girls (who if they're teenagers I'd eat my hat) are talking about "non-stop party", so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party. Meanwhile, a psychotic has escaped the local bug-house where one girl's father works & is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs, and sporting wide-open eyes...I guess that's to show he's bonkers. Of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house, the location of which is apparently common knowledge. In the meantime, some dumb-jock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls, and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats. And that's about it, as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background. Or, maybe that's not it, but really, that's all you need to know. Unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk, you'll find little of interest here, and even if you are wasted most of the time, you'll still probably find your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10.	-4.506334942634112	-2.342265350235696	-1.9631218212554964	-1.8596099748484247	-1.7843639800196684	-1.6304078925605006	-1.3606868075245553	-0.48650520062294283	-0.473084416199173	-0.41874706497489145	-0.0398412701056164	0.009824054600072893	0.03313796594562157	0.056388031836815816	0.10768631109920088	0.13519220127430404	0.20411723772570095	0.2649033210634747	0.48255757762111207	0.5088515075372506	0.5231214573957246	0.8645482787469517	2.135440010080602	2.2487881865874515	5.030808272452579	
Nobody could like this movie for its merit but, if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. It ranks up there with "Road House" for its preposterous characters, sets and story line. The bad writing really cracked me up: "I want you to dust those guys off" instead of ". . . dust those guys." F-14s take off from the carrier but, when they get into formation, they're F-16s! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who, only minutes before, was overseeing a covert "mind wipe" on Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards. So naturally, the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway. The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afganistan without refueling. Then Segal flies it back to California - the long way, i.e., by way of Europe - even though there's a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen TVs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls. What a hoot!	-3.361713140965576	-2.4346388311781735	-1.8301359329860576	-1.341476390864928	-1.1314966645533344	-0.9724148439571494	-0.8738894828464248	-0.4196823343414763	-0.3248351389326988	-0.2702766003243483	-0.14077736069520277	-0.056406186846064826	-0.028859252067226504	0.07333327916161259	0.17122421496012816	0.28598653634557375	0.29626168832134125	0.492804752782483	0.8236380596506373	0.9409452082366411	1.173156262305111	1.3477648140244196	1.517289347265081	2.6885136388030073	4.8503380713413025	
Some people say the pace of this film is a little slow, but how is this different from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move very deliberately and, as a point, have spurts of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it. This movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema that exists in Hitchcock's collection (the best probably being almost all of "Rear Window"). Pure Cinema for Hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue, in order to tell the story visually. This is, of course the basic definition of the Albert Hall sequence, as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture. <br /><br />Not many slip-ups by Hitchcock here, and the acting is superb especially by Doris Day in a rather surprising serious role.	-2.456337916124522	-2.407084888500943	-1.0916504048584432	-0.7947864287867077	-0.719989817638666	-0.1530890269799947	-0.05917111811999251	0.08684635089994715	0.2083008960027754	0.311044831779955	0.34497698041991554	0.36307066870258575	0.37012841655758666	0.4569451141781733	0.46082527419487523	0.5805974176216939	0.6808192918989024	0.7655589124609614	0.9156144526871253	0.988986296398372	1.0116888541075506	1.2665795683509609	1.4907319030108477	1.5260063498462013	2.9049953104023127	
I don't understand why more people have not commented on this, other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it. It's an amazing cast of characters, one after another after another, all done by the guy who wrote the play. If you don't like filmed plays, you may not like this (after all, plays usually don't look good on TV), but it's a one-man show that will have you paying attention throughout. Highly recommended.	-0.9355256277591932	-0.8862260896029804	-0.79460980627258	-0.6768550756156425	-0.3483296122234868	-0.3439280756313995	-0.32879415340532	-0.21719458565903774	-0.21431573772087376	-0.14027191046571502	-0.015939598820134918	-0.01443308521823472	0.05106758853290322	0.10842760299757664	0.17469227112263314	0.2190732071604861	0.29378755611433593	0.354511481110207	0.40148292644558536	0.5032750939371842	0.5343229043806064	0.6209174568253795	1.1355745621529076	1.2174049759773755	1.3836364838671302	
Any story comprises a premise, characters and conflict. Characters plotting their own play promises triumph, and a militant character readily lends oneself to this. Ardh Satya's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "ek palde mein napunsaktha, doosre palde mein paurush, aur teek tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satya ?". A rough translation - "The delicate balance of right & wrong ( commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts ) has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another. Is the needle on the center a half-truth ? "<br /><br />The poem is recited midway in the film by Smita Patil to Om Puri at a resturant. It makes a deep impact on the protagonist & lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem.<br /><br />The film tries mighty hard to do a one-up on the poem. However, Chitre's words are too powerful, and at best, the film matches up to the poem in every aspect.<br /><br />	-4.49716465176419	-1.9999333376215958	-1.6088369204828523	-1.5066867009937839	-1.4488700779237262	-0.8235342932090398	-0.760732444153805	-0.5661890177989304	-0.21549141269616687	-0.20642851786546548	-0.14840237995325842	-0.0632403085318666	0.04873503516806102	0.08225792980252312	0.14517315857127733	0.1770393435029371	0.30251471129215624	0.4116847085361515	0.4148738673531718	0.5723957593632846	0.6190505811246382	0.8936104812428565	1.2234262328581231	2.0997761875340575	4.564614153233949	
I had seen this movie when I was a boy (Before WWII) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. Saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not a "A" movie. No editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. Should not even be as high as a "B" Had a laugh at how jaded I've become over the years. Seems to me I thought it was good when I originally saw it.	-3.131901442163335	-1.627102344041258	-1.4340651996717284	-1.376506803924123	-1.3374211238583107	-0.831572174070285	-0.6316036918337085	-0.5711335909570591	-0.34592004615914074	-0.23236063180245303	-0.2262342065076585	-0.1584232641826956	-0.09185496946066637	0.10445766585952125	0.13686135892014886	0.18426854332054993	0.22685418759063558	0.35833785372701155	0.4514349991642771	0.6182670043096866	0.6441637054772047	0.7245653612184486	0.7565169598369805	1.8630932820493642	3.2659861685756923	
This was a great movie! It was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy. So what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think that if that were the sole criteria, our culture would be the poorer for it. So this movie is to "The Godfather" as new wave music is to Mozart. The point is, it is one of the best movies of it's type I've seen. The women are all beautiful (as are only seen on California beaches when movies are being made). It has a little of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets Wayne's World. There is plenty of charm and a reasonable (albeit predictable) storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen. Joe Estevez may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent Uncle Bud. Contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in. (Was that intentional?) If you're attracted to the box, rent the video, you won't regret it. As is promised, it is good non-violent erotic fun!	-4.3539587273901335	-3.176730250694316	-2.3532158967966814	-1.652833350064717	-1.2628023413446683	-0.7015629045252548	-0.20651710834395326	-0.19824404304550675	0.09390708796070626	0.13679211508789943	0.14788862595239477	0.24456521336223858	0.3034576396552221	0.4375886064460559	0.49906577762525883	0.5189425255889186	0.8662076074522306	0.9195000263445222	1.2180617668277232	1.4817013256991498	1.510463988404604	1.855704983101491	3.4873122167246686	4.487435457535176	4.5656750468234275	
I don't remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlake's in "Edison." I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. Timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting Andy Dick to play the lead role in "Patton," or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But that is almost beside the point.<br /><br />Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role. I used to have problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like "The 25 Cliché Expressions for Actors," he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, I do not and will not buy his role as an amateur-turned-crusader-for-justice journalist. It simply will not fly.<br /><br />However, Timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure. Director David J. Burke puts him not only in the (essentially) primary role, but also places him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was as good) LL Cool J. I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with Timberlake.<br /><br />There is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there it feels like a double relief. A pleasure, if you will. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />But enough of Timberlake bashing - words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick. "Edison" is a very, very run-of-the-mill corruption story. It's plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous. I do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which I interpret as an homage to films like "Serpico," or "Donnie Brasco," or maybe even "Chinatown." Don't get me wrong - "Edison" is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.<br /><br />The script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing. Yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (who is wasted here) and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawson's Creek episode. It's your typical far-too-glib-for-reality, let's-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-we-articulate (and fail) dialogue. This dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like "Edison" wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds (read slow-motion).<br /><br />Thinking about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. It's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by Timberlake who simply doesn't work. In film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off. Directors must make tough choices. David J. Burke missed the mark here. Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture. And it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with.	-14.900589402604869	-7.9799129286760095	-7.3393123269743406	-6.995588269618867	-6.940595885500202	-4.813305734955214	-4.756090399875168	-1.561612272037942	-1.218716246576669	-0.982822366886198	-0.8866891000217977	-0.403149977073965	0.7090294135486477	0.7597163204787953	0.8633880804884586	0.9470944494130302	1.1810307441236074	1.4168338939712233	1.6233538317610892	2.476565954517045	2.7085628134438715	2.7127525386625244	5.142462144716447	9.645641467564545	18.03537109898324	
...a true geek-girl's dream: high tech, high drama, smart guys, steamy sex, and large explosions. (VERY large explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that tapes of the REAL Oppenheimer sound odd: apparently, he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most stirring dramas, and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, not to call attention to themselves. An interesting fact: some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified, and so are of special interest. A must-see!	-2.597703672926208	-0.99266805786193	-0.9357483757446241	-0.918316697283569	-0.6379838979409025	-0.27383750120979916	-0.264101727130453	-0.1866808921294773	-0.05242459783066797	0.0019472385769084694	0.1545988892864294	0.16972821656877513	0.1702602003826547	0.5973181635784518	0.6851191901108153	0.7390783510169467	0.8608905547469894	0.9096174834714259	0.9866814402862132	0.991383678172628	1.0113539004459953	1.2434836639940563	1.5773768228242495	1.7681335367522513	2.1700896902974973	
One of master director Alfred Hitchcock's finer films this is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day, and their young son) who are vacationing in north Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. Later one, the Frenchman whispers something into Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. The rest of the film is a puzzle as Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. You never really know what's going on in this film, why people are appearing, until the end and even then you're not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.	-2.2569392804206365	-2.1312293786448526	-1.4794098932644766	-1.4165889897963493	-0.9657550642248737	-0.6524143611903584	-0.5077431144094039	-0.31143115318159575	0.03215976510406458	0.11063774636082446	0.12146266354700187	0.1696414689142874	0.17555897670661863	0.26242543684421504	0.31646221503371375	0.3318322533283857	0.3653218370353159	0.45799430419657994	0.48043931852995153	0.4909579129143612	0.7021819398787197	0.8197470437191541	1.736144190722024	1.9070773634099907	3.963770611594894

Eric Bogosian's ability to roll from character to character in this 'one man show' exhibits his true range as a character actor. Each persona has their own message to convey about truth, society, class, drugs, etc. This is an absolute Must Have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting! His performance contains some of the most Hilarious and Real moments I have ever experienced as a viewing audience.	-1.8900742556919186	-1.3816889936502552	-0.750857725716454	-0.6829423289575389	-0.5115972511111598	-0.44120326834718493	-0.2821223618553664	0.022593983931653173	0.06013989816625622	0.06882346719667243	0.10870901439812523	0.10954306200341975	0.23629779503459758	0.24384065378648961	0.29902488184510884	0.4012339744953393	0.402848848947875	0.4941605957881714	0.6108103112050263	0.6348677814015635	0.6861935804086206	0.716548750436323	0.8965492772789236	1.2072449092366928	1.8163743155589005	
In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!! However the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as being a band called Firstryke and the album was "Just a Nightmare" and it was very well written!! and I am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far I would appreciate the feed back, I collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks. It is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding. I have seen this bands music being sold in Germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album.

This movie is intelligent. That is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.<br /><br />The script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.<br /><br />The dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very, very rarely is "love" in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.<br /><br />This is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!	-7.457964010610728	-5.752147126812497	-2.917098204941335	-2.776535628845208	-2.6515493327507618	-0.6652254937610657	0.06025380915154205	0.06441156712876805	0.1530768370736584	0.7379547762094989	1.0349074927776871	1.21102599102952	1.4887464453516535	1.5253050798864045	1.5362539516523208	1.6054783292069474	1.748661151357322	1.756913747485213	2.9843186637953885	3.007153278437386	3.1924913671817214	3.806260809031789	5.025148013474615	5.354202411376217	8.29497696195801	
This movie was poorly conceived, poorly written and poorly acted. All of the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The movie was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. The Christian characters are holier-than-thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters. The movie was a real "gotcha" for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie. I remember another movie on a similar subject, "The Rapture," starring Mimi Rogers, that was much better and professionally done. I think I'll watch "The Rapture" again. If you attend "Unidentified" and don't like it, don't say I haven't warned you.	-5.951173701975561	-2.836040836066639	-2.5724788055989847	-2.2021578544564315	-2.124632620504449	-2.014128101825558	-1.848131968729061	-0.4220205443364281	-0.3429800797464476	-0.27088674425220927	-0.20976410523162428	-0.09863231726573558	-0.016062885862111735	0.028295690412390634	0.06233398742885628	0.11422565352267183	0.41492543686590855	0.504085946620208	0.6182855028934272	0.9884526378338729	1.1286194048579843	1.1627344272063715	3.051772018719413	3.0635039651448177	6.207112430840988	
i'm not even sure what to say about this film. it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic. to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa "like dancing about architecture". it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again. this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no profound life lessons, just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings...... romantic love.<br /><br />10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger................	-1.9137209744229653	-1.6016903195631875	-1.5909562559348078	-1.3439672876849966	-0.8908106208750843	-0.49509972457530005	-0.44290829087801914	-0.40784755647199283	-0.38194593830533335	-0.13794624540002426	-0.066675443696674	0.12293938315048938	0.16574675567516262	0.18821427605501623	0.19198486957223038	0.22431376965509972	0.2513641198610986	0.5053127676114909	0.5736147714054948	0.6656979912444544	0.7126191600501255	0.8013098018867106	1.6713377209230043	2.1062597954233517	3.328184627150736	
The storyline of The Milkwoman is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong. Now 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works two jobs  one as a checkout clerk in a supermarket, the other as a milklady, doing her daily round on the hills of Nagasaki. One of her stops is at the house of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who tends to his terminally ill wife Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita used to see each other as school children, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who it seems were having an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. Lying in her sick bed, Yoko knows however that her husband's feelings for the milklady aren't completely gone and, for the sake of Kaita after she has died, she attempts to engineer a means of bringing them back together.<br /><br />While the story might be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film lie. The film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions being recorded by an old lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her own husband who is showing signs of dementia. In the process it depicts the social circumstances of people from different ways of life, how they interact with each other on a daily basis, how relationships form, and how past and present can collide. The director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style. It's only later in the film that the story starts to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it is indeed being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book that is being written. It's all validated by the emotional depths the film touches, represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of Yuko Tanaka.	-3.157868525843384	-2.2833200425195734	-2.108991675139311	-1.5034279642080541	-1.3646888945234386	-1.1201058554859373	-1.1096730313923047	-0.5982257796241555	-0.566029292707829	-0.32819886551542454	-0.05820136077690963	-0.03555487443096627	0.27120389680262086	0.32693529807654315	0.47854144661995984	0.5478988840287589	0.6069020552402891	0.6878972562274156	0.6896852783765397	0.873894317755771	0.9173111445416888	1.7050990435287126	2.981813316620584	3.129501228914041	4.184181868343084	
Wow, I've sure seen quite a bit of Kelli McCarty this summer. I didn't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years. It's like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me, much like Michelle Hall did a couple of years ago.<br /><br />"Passion's Peak" is the third quality softcore flick I've seen Kelli McCarty in, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the others. "Desire and Deception" was okay, but it wasn't spectacular. There's spoilers in this review, so read only if you want to.<br /><br />The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) heading out of the big city and to the mountains. She has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge. Before she can even set her things down, some woman named Kim (uncredited in this film, but quite the aggressive one) begins booking guests to stay there. Now she has to get the house into shape quickly--in comes Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, to the rescue. Chip helps her get the house in workable condition. She hires two local slackers to work in her lodge--Chip's sister Bait (Samantha McConnell) and her sex buddy Hank.<br /><br />Now the guests start coming. The first to arrive are Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotypical money-first lawyers. Linda and Eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup; sad stuff there. Next, there's romance novelist Sophia, played by B-movie goddess Monique Parent. She's using that silly alias Scarlet Johansing again, and she's got a very professional look this time--with blonde hair, of course. It wouldn't be Monique if she didn't have at least one scene where she plays with herself--and she obliges, during one of Eric and Linda's sex scenes.<br /><br />James and Shene (Devinn Lane--yes, the porn star Devinn Lane) show up for a little weekend getaway as well. Unbeknownst to Shene, James and Christina have quite a history. James and Christina used to date, but Christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge. James comes up to the lodge to get Christina back, but his plan backfires. Christina spills the beans to Shene, which causes Shene to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals. Shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now-single Eric, and they leave together. Bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with Hank, and Christine finds true love with Chip, with Sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel. <br /><br />In fact....if you ask me, this whole movie played out like a romance novel. I don't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect, but I sure got that impression. Sophia had some of the best lines in this film, playing up the idea that this is a live-action romance novel. She seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on.<br /><br />Now to the sex. There was a fair amount of it, and it was the usual bump-and grind stuff. Monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes. This film was tapeworthy, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes.<br /><br />Women: A- (Monique was simply Monique. Out of all the softcore actresses I've seen over the years, she's the best at acting, in my opinion. She can really act and be sexy, which is why she's holding on to the #1 position in my Skinemax Top 10. Kelli McCarty is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera "Passions"; I don't know why she's not doing more of these. Flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role. Samantha McConnell continues to impress me, and Devinn Lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it.)<br /><br />Sex: B (It was good, but not awe-inspiring spectacular. Plenty of moaning. Don't watch the R-rated version, trust me....most of the good stuff is taken out. My grade is for the uncut version.)<br /><br />Story: B (A solid storyline which throws in a contrived "Ooh, the building inspector's gonna shut us down" subplot toward the end which messes up things. The underlying story between Christina and James was nice, and Sophia's dialogue, full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels, was a nice touch.)<br /><br />Overall: B+ (I found this movie to be quite entertaining. It's not a surefire Softcore Hall-Of-Famer like "Girl for Girl" is, but it's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)	-8.028009398485068	-7.844095073951306	-5.509689728590343	-4.822149932246858	-2.9401029147575537	-2.842198886937227	-2.475588921549905	-0.8085774378516344	-0.5781479830790046	-0.4338661980467965	-0.32752116454660174	-0.24103642772365463	-0.13844625408620323	0.075413370803522	0.08002049450968672	0.7307838664775026	1.3477766874550763	1.4087037709488608	3.4043282472490426	3.4081866063364528	5.616977270666047	6.459429585190952	7.483799384643455	7.876534737063099	13.838906717824266	
The movie started very well..so far Isabelle's exorcism could be believed....but later, gosh!!! I didn't know if it was a horror movie, a drama one or a Must Not See one! The possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie....the make up!! well it looked pretty real at beginning, but at the end, last part of movie, the make up (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. If you want a good "EXorcism" movie watch "The Exorcism of Emily Rose".<br /><br />Together with "Hard Candy" (Totally boring, pathetic plot and ending), these two movies are the worst I've seen from Lionsgate!! But well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films, but with this one, you will wish you never rent it!! Exorcism movie fans, just stay with two "The Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"	-2.1424001328042603	-1.8922374284467887	-1.3347678675552448	-1.0862516171880083	-0.686327410590209	-0.5104396476696447	-0.4866914916011588	-0.4800194172607414	-0.47039143543118533	-0.4220315491411872	-0.2840799969479767	-0.27696850167943465	-0.27440468997978773	-0.0586203823268972	0.0025315059310526827	0.07343738808128304	0.18540264211849136	0.3206704179643666	0.40826581074385887	0.5508460109443735	0.5657397815405908	0.9370746567392786	1.0439360108004603	1.2184573909986265	2.62735392019261	
I was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever. I didn't realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story. It was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th grader's book report on the novel. Meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses. Mrs Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all; they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet. And that's just the beginning. By halfway through the movie I found myself shouting at the screen, much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn't read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs down for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this movie is kinda alright.	-5.128173227898997	-2.2718927418287556	-2.223909892314759	-2.0675244788807685	-1.8905737912928389	-1.7899307167267626	-1.678596043570862	-0.3903555606635606	-0.3523384232413308	-0.1864148261160325	-0.11512210163579223	-0.1073844744234928	0.036941200709939996	0.10122076994855003	0.14601629129230437	0.3687410462554209	0.38979774854156357	0.6260344657601007	0.649131186111619	0.7746759332303291	0.9296208016722625	0.967963248813924	1.6334123100681568	2.7453028347931885	5.513989774890057	
Many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message, thus confusing the hero, not to mention the audience...<br /><br />Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and his wife Jo, a former musical star (Doris Day) are vacationing in Morocco with their son, Hank (Christopher Olsen), when they meet Mr. and Mrs. Drayton, a British couple (Brenda de Banzie and Bernard Miles). They are also befriended by a charming Frenchman, Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin), who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute...<br /><br />The MacKennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the Draytons, when they spot Louis Bernard... <br /><br />The next day in the market place, they are caught in an assassination intrigue... While they are wandering in the local market, the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an Arab fleeing from his pursuers... Dr. McKenna stands amazed as the Arab falls into his arms, a knife sticking out of his back... <br /><br />Gulping his last breath, the dying man mutters some words and collapses... Dr. McKenna is completely taken aback when the Arab's hood falls from his head and he is revealed as Bernard in disguise... McKenna is left knowing too little, but as far as the assassins are concerned, too much...<br /><br />To prevent Dr. McKenna from revealing what he knows, the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage... The film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnappinghow to get the little boy back safely... The subplot about the assassination is just the setup...<br /><br />The film is a breathless escapade... The death of Bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it... <br /><br />Stewart is charged with emotion as the Midwestern doctor, accidentally involved in political intrigue... His perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly humana person we could easily identify with... It is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film... <br /><br />By 1956, the lovely Doris Day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer... She had been particularly strong opposite James Cagney in the Ruth Etting's biopic, 'Love Me or Leave Me,' but she was still unsure of her basic Thespian talents...<br /><br />The casting of character actor Reggie Malder as the assassin, is brilliant... The man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil...	-1.7468675642312674	-1.3573946466192348	-1.1872841202283089	-1.0643878257589816	-0.9601627493327123	-0.7352809250762509	-0.46681487770805546	-0.42610771002827674	-0.32588165848666184	-0.3229029763571325	-0.23258531293015416	-0.20126623680181033	-0.0781929506385631	0.0070428658379081445	0.15143641245010342	0.2505214573630471	0.2573262635443393	0.2586066449459188	0.3203462264451946	0.3503939821165517	0.36783334256529304	0.6152182264764068	0.7462701286176175	1.1500561627500476	1.700742272610379	
Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. The author of the original book "Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married! Orso Maria Guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women, one of whom is played by Arsan herself. Despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less-than-spectacular finale. Much like D'Amato's EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBALS, the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe, but don't get your hopes up, there's no violence at all in this film, and not much sex either for that matter. Just a lot of nudity and silly dialog. I couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film, if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by.	-3.245542462776783	-2.1341509343350094	-1.8003972822092824	-1.7001448922970488	-1.3579915629938577	-1.2839344643091917	-1.0407509677163094	-0.4592917799947325	-0.41970840437131096	-0.3630673846234031	-0.25497408186101117	-0.1312760556232934	-9.047960420192347E-4	0.046461230193054745	0.36371888050439294	0.3941631975584756	0.4320574089632132	0.5014484872514003	0.5795610952821018	0.7377845844230382	0.7424476827861671	1.0031635905364156	1.607208040953913	2.484779296947244	4.83599142552518	
Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus, I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.<br /><br />Boy, what a terrible film. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the "director's cut", or in this case, "let's salvage whatever we can" from this notorious box office flop. In releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someone's death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews. Things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. There's no catalyst in this story.<br /><br />One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews' (and Edwards') previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment "I'll give you three guesses" was created just to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona, which is turned "raunchy" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending, bird's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane, is another "wink" at SOUND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and British mother, who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. I'm like "what happened here?"<br /><br />The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Where's Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her "uncle" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. That's one slow moving train there. <br /><br />The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The "Girl in no man's land" is OK even if it's bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?<br /><br />The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, like she's on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she's no Greta Garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute.<br /><br />How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.	-28.979953899742657	-12.128516360064234	-10.293925901537268	-10.049869109269398	-9.952589441213082	-9.53084863777262	-7.639691733806531	-3.3748812675425968	-2.8759824002199306	-1.940614066781037	-1.2446705709504873	0.8971904960884024	0.9242645582585921	1.7014886368111013	1.9881695539581845	2.1337121960816954	2.170240920733789	2.70295280696544	2.729489398102539	2.93209675701381	4.145313592296776	4.625772527182034	13.344619880846333	13.56035940368552	30.225542639736958	
"Night of the Hunted" stars French porn star Brigitte Lahaie.In fact,many of the cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming.This film is certainly different than Rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks,but it's not as memorable as for example "Lips of Blood" or "Fascination".Lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from.Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex,where Lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition.Anyway,she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held.On a highway outside of town,she meets a young man,who stops and picks her up."Night of the Hunted" offers plenty of nudity,unfortunately the pace is extremely slow.The atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another asylum inmate Dominique Journet is well-developed.Still "Night of the Hunted" is too dull to be completely enjoyable.Give it a look only if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.	-2.8368132470125444	-1.4761514440502843	-1.4287778298611642	-1.3372201442576184	-1.2831488497716754	-0.7770503880053284	-0.5201266889882238	-0.4864480363266057	-0.2808977148639581	-0.24606326094314723	-0.2261625894930293	-0.1701004594260836	-0.146946844646056	0.02292356230143089	0.042903254143974376	0.1025745672482116	0.2141587424571051	0.2950331856060889	0.39988986760793616	0.5195920593496137	0.5395975465291265	0.6081048672104877	1.119105149393782	1.7866822171656465	3.1177480464379657	
I was going to bed with my gf last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, I flipped channels until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Masks. At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie, so I started watching it, and then it immediately captured me in, and I had to finish it.<br /><br />The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. She was such a great actor for being so little. Maybe the fact it was in Chinese, so the English was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly. I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her "boss" but everything just turned out rotten. lol. Even when she brings him another grandson, just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped, so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live. lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa, just backfires.<br /><br />In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.<br /><br />Definitely a gem, and totally original.<br /><br />Scott	-2.635021740288249	-2.337952482018432	-1.7297267615596907	-1.2117382534546726	-0.9958466617863527	-0.8589038971095591	-0.6265496934630148	-0.47306921765125287	-0.4164618553480359	-0.3181472380337311	-0.3037416623859417	-0.20914271903249798	-0.19869983789289025	-0.08782370949384911	-0.07752424943358324	0.3581200134272971	0.6452212908432146	0.6992762538010898	1.200657253194594	1.44049789252706	1.976888169871254	2.2942213183213926	2.30219672635992	2.7346460221905966	3.262431827260661	
I am a big fan of this film and found the TV mini series "Children of The Dust", the version fans should look for. At least 20 minutes or more are cut on the DVD version of this film.<br /><br />I would also suggest viewers who enjoyed this film to check out the book there is a more rounded storyline with Corby/Whitewolf and Rachel, more on Black History and Buffalo Solders. There were two many storylines for the series or this film.<br /><br />Sidney Poitier only shows he gets better with age, the talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor were wonderful viewing. I also enjoyed the Billy Wirth/Joanna Going storyline, they seems to play off each other well.<br /><br />Billy Wirth is of course the "Model of Indian Vision". The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who was wanted to be carried off in one of those romance novels by a native hero. Worked for me also.<br /><br />Much more could have been done with this storyline but it did give the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the 1880's, white take over of native schooling, lack of Black pioneers to setup towns in the west. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell) as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher, not sure if the "whites" should be interfering with native culture.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoys characters and watching them change this film is for you. I thought the chemistry between Poitier's character and that of the orphan Whitewolf very moving and thought Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. Billy Wirth did some of his best scenes when working with Poitier.<br /><br />Going got on my nerves sometimes when you want to just stop and shake her or give her a " wake-up and grown-up" call. But on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment.<br /><br />Look for the two tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference.	-2.768232867645231	-2.693773809496005	-2.471268957908674	-1.5596588457221525	-0.6623427914448744	-0.6462966844604776	-0.4509266031719759	-0.3717866177370628	-0.2254237598034466	-0.1428175718145421	-0.03732797208736804	0.0208894779489344	0.12176008832562651	0.14186775257955742	0.40407117037228674	0.46966437948835216	0.5004627352926113	0.5168860172669406	0.9160895573919169	1.318051996584858	1.4598070175183546	1.773657555798176	2.5834172759684293	3.2276550065779537	4.083617476238956	
It was probably just my DVD---but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.<br /><br />I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.<br /><br />Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. <br /><br />With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.<br /><br />There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.<br /><br />After about a half hour, I gave up, having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture, either.	-4.166349090531346	-2.1040058097287955	-1.5630397007734382	-1.3336701281863583	-1.2448811870451644	-1.2319961496580494	-0.7688821267310544	-0.5834193156259864	-0.5148578117873895	-0.28091165312841077	-0.2511056145723136	-0.03164985821577331	0.09133434259914068	0.17469416591064435	0.4953437190302006	0.5288116677159015	0.7229906685809615	0.7341305374075179	0.7517700600911968	0.8133229198743168	0.8421078380918587	0.8695297465527652	1.1058971379415374	2.2464239881073684	4.416819098669582	
Seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release I don't quite get it. Why has this been such a huge hit in 1986? Its amateurishness drips from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitative and over the top (that is not to say that Miss Rudnik does not have nice boobs!). The singing is "schrecklich". The only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing, a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid-eighties. It's really quite puzzling to me how incapable I am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my fellow IMDBers comments).	-4.4351519208675985	-1.6992698684421383	-1.5327838409616197	-1.519870831221743	-1.316005080898872	-1.1998778198506426	-1.0829272708823798	-0.7339337537258989	-0.3966019271529081	-0.21167191995517096	-0.13672015548454292	-0.12018778833869262	-0.10232597426327092	-0.08548490138065615	-0.08463450606084134	0.1729543040958678	0.24120635451479022	0.24405330056997712	0.33875868568839407	0.40941422367875435	0.5316921829747318	0.5439335849818207	1.767126623807129	1.9190227466598277	3.877205527305449	
This is a fabulous film.<br /><br /> The plot is a good yarn, and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. What was deliberate, and what was coincidence? Who is in love with who?<br /><br /> You get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth.<br /><br /> With a bit of effort following the twists and turns, you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people.<br /><br /> Take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen.<br /><br /> More than keeping you guessing, the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds - I defy anyone to predict!<br /><br /> But more likely you will need more than one viewing - I saw this at the pictures on its original release three times, and it got better each time.<br /><br /> The acting was very good, with a standout performance by Romane Bohringer as Alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble.<br /><br /> A classic. The second-best film of the 1990s.	-4.109142442542944	-1.758016835644474	-1.374966528629097	-1.2548016344289314	-0.8438157244861926	-0.825192553528476	-0.32774185920245874	-0.18655046292135166	0.02538404354308592	0.3095429152936031	0.4352141408239997	0.44613536512171714	0.4562504988806344	0.6866733178889173	1.050678516586206	1.0639183680561	1.1147340486410429	1.2119110036244698	1.247417289935349	1.5932827916200223	1.596967329229784	1.7424479331719378	1.882566383768607	1.9753241484779966	3.363786710479171	
When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought that it sounded really interesting... so... I had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the "4 for 20 dollars" section at Blockbuster. When we got home and popped in the movie... twenty minutes into it, we found ourselves turning to each other going "this sucks. Let's put in something else." I'll admit, a few of the lines from the friends at the café made us smile a little bit. But come ON, at least get some decent actors! Every once in a while in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting, I can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they're over(or under)doing their lines. But I can only take so much. Crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines... amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film.<br /><br />Anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie. It's the most pointless thing I've ever had the displeasure of watching. DO NOT WATCH OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!	-3.028971507649629	-2.2383226280480133	-2.1218263375017417	-2.028389526587078	-1.6967446471124925	-1.0705934132035608	-1.0384367939462273	-0.47377119047019994	-0.42960831071313343	-0.3849782021274941	-0.3755250206035712	-0.12183424971165258	-0.0491902996596483	0.17005119339212235	0.29318853803806655	0.35180352197554354	0.35378898077010246	0.596820119768267	0.6073645714925597	0.8470517664486819	0.8654488891286727	0.9264259425134291	1.6432889238671013	2.7263942962806005	4.236494796510904	
Unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />The Plot - Even for a Seagal film, the plot is just stupid. I mean its not just bad, its barely coherent.<br /><br />The Acting - Unbelievably wooden. Literally seen better acting in porno's. Ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a 'lesbian love scene' which is utterly cringe-worthy.<br /><br />Special Effects - wouldn't look out of place in a 60's sword and sorcery flick.<br /><br />Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures, don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this DVD, as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back.	-4.64739034460765	-2.3905568943385225	-2.275524385252977	-2.170331600563517	-1.9806252491883136	-1.0065970481107855	-0.7531952726333452	-0.6798683233235101	-0.45096769717996044	-0.27940501356465614	-0.2629312673668712	-0.25079477129091465	-0.23123653277831224	-0.17685453217416977	0.21486060368993623	0.24350301882414457	0.35119108078980554	0.42526889518544303	0.45335282873275645	0.47745394824607956	0.5927301748093851	0.7875631058095377	1.471509181434091	2.3308872199425252	4.718207989554551	
The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in the money for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off was shown for about two episodes in Australia but didn't rate; probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the Australian-written script. Bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey. My advice to USA viewers is DON'T.<br /><br />Americans should be best advised to find DVD's of the ORIGINAL VERSION on eBay, but be aware that some DVDs are in a different 'zone format' to those issued in the USA. Otherwise, some DVD players will operate discs from both/all zones.	-4.377547542580046	-2.124502447420057	-2.0687598270946417	-2.041248689272875	-1.987383057892415	-1.1854703355505014	-0.555601866126128	-0.5376689386341716	-0.3824567889298761	-0.3236562265979135	-0.3153098550219582	-0.2266546833933437	-0.2033524605372468	-0.1502089534568834	0.24753672783612732	0.26381574609315356	0.3895425631324271	0.4364244714959026	0.4631406723790754	0.5564962350418188	0.6751327998284606	0.7124437525852564	1.5154112749426787	2.2056446330728527	4.627642203363316	
A very moving and thought provoking film that raises issues of mental health, terminal illness and euthanasia. Sound a bit too heavy? It is a little, but this is all treated in a realistically straight forward way within a story of the changes that take place to the family who have to deal with these things. This is a positive story of facing up to life and responsibility that isn't overwhelm by the subject matter.<br /><br />Afterlife is beautifully shot and crafted film set in modern times and dealing with modern issues. It is a character driven, enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performances.<br /><br />Unfortunate it is not the sort of film that always performs well at the box office, so catch it while you can.	-2.5754944797203083	-1.5665471380935299	-0.9583431044713666	-0.9026901847179186	-0.7733034367480068	-0.37140185981269924	-0.12424314708568715	7.807225439146505E-4	0.11176778537523348	0.35013645353628686	0.350889020315191	0.39590791195326464	0.41075779585155175	0.41801386919790573	0.4773864732444765	0.48919156736621083	0.5782816597551661	0.7935209233916889	0.8774112756842168	0.9664852578131553	1.1612927832189672	1.3165855502650974	1.7987991151155573	2.2129321843179035	2.398209412482439	
Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it's just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I'll never let go, Jack." Titanic is a great film down to it's very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.	-3.63049327661502	-3.5189288489462514	-2.9301986585374458	-2.512127456448056	-1.470807663855227	-1.1157328302012746	-0.8369187009376522	-0.7111175293478749	-0.5025168182861434	-0.2530005536031254	-0.23383239143204393	0.1098163613779062	0.30903417008893447	0.40164104820174307	0.4477628649217106	0.4557455429271181	0.5397078868971059	0.8020989918354007	0.9714894450313539	1.0583791788308299	1.3805237284826672	1.6372544142515084	2.8707421590868734	3.7104035994385396	6.484616843713081	
The film lacks style, i mean original style. everything looks copied including action, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialog delivery, etc etc. Yes, there the goof-ups were original, like in the beginning a car is shown with number UP**** number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number MH**** . That was one in many goof-ups of the movie :) Anything good in the movie? yes, for kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogs and action stunts. Thats it. nothing else. So watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors. Director is already insane and actors, i pity them.	-3.50997894170347	-2.21860961907073	-1.9250526315568401	-1.263527077740386	-1.1803902762836531	-0.9579132135578703	-0.5443347525458481	-0.22911497751248172	-0.19635960855198903	-0.1630028746473471	-0.12469438285201422	-0.09571930983611468	0.04346865890662041	0.1074215947089268	0.13553677031150646	0.18313903367272574	0.321753222200567	0.32772926208753317	0.33012609870432874	0.3840326963371533	0.8165215577008519	0.8893264351561099	1.2907583657009913	2.0040190533947455	3.9212268735936884	
Sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth the<br /><br />celluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well be<br /><br />the dullest produced.<br /><br />Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course,<br /><br />and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by a<br /><br />mysterious stranger. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to<br /><br />get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard<br /><br />bait.<br /><br />John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B-movie guy, did the lousy<br /><br />makeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken, of "The<br /><br />Witches of Eastwick" and the Addams family movies. Sadly, he<br /><br />does not pop up until the very end of the film, and is covered in<br /><br />burn makeup, rendering him unrecognizable. Steve Bond (anyone<br /><br />remember him?) is here in an early role as a victim.<br /><br />Brown's direction, and the script he cowrote, both smell like the<br /><br />presents brown bears leave in the woods. He pads the film with<br /><br />so much stock wilderness footage, I thought I accidentally rented a<br /><br />special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Much of the<br /><br />cast sits around the campfire and eats, then walk, and sit and eat<br /><br />again. The forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put<br /><br />in a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a<br /><br />baby deer. Jackie Coogan, who must have forgot he once worked<br /><br />with the legends of silent cinema, has two scenes, and is involved<br /><br />in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he and<br /><br />the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and<br /><br />cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread...yeah.<br /><br />There is not one minute of suspense here. The killer, a forest fire<br /><br />survivor looking for a mate, watches the students from behind<br /><br />trees. We know it is the killer because the film makers have<br /><br />dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake<br /><br />the viewer up every few minutes.

Other than the great cinematography by the marvelous James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this film is a true stinker.<br /><br />This is the second film that I've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first was Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt." It was so lousy that I shut it off. This one I'm afraid is not very much better.<br /><br />Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps, her performance as the virgin Queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren, it is absolutely no match. In robotic fashion, Robson states her lines. Her battle message to the English troops is so lackluster in spirit.<br /><br />Even a dashing Laurence Olivier can't save this utter piece of boredom.<br /><br />Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn't really convey anything here. To think, that Scarlett was 2 years later!<br /><br />It's a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is made out to be so boring in this film.	-6.186979168869354	-2.9187188799358053	-2.742852187413972	-2.7033492849552196	-2.6918136249515108	-1.7357739032551218	-1.6609090967852127	-0.9965744197283386	-0.5424976955008646	-0.38886482162782376	-0.3665830050242787	-0.31132702431080284	-0.13459129278012488	0.06238076901242951	0.08755223601919238	0.3180740047784192	0.38299918933578686	0.5221326639102493	0.5511706568242052	0.8032237982472474	0.9104977293123053	1.3160408211850938	2.3668282391227047	2.652300132235433	6.49996859023555	
I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival, and can't quite decide about it. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them. Maybe that was the point, that we are all in a "bubble" of our own, but these people didn't compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates. At a running time of just over an hour, the characters weren't very well developed. Lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and the slightly-creepy-looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes, that most of the characters made for a living, were somehow more interesting than the live people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never quite came together.	-1.4118091943104714	-1.4028651005242612	-1.002350835458337	-0.8093048941493943	-0.6322352468357049	-0.4275356709022872	-0.15091812670601334	-0.11320354508600033	-0.10779555621980841	-0.08129525090739226	-0.07967129058881128	0.028529944920409542	0.04138104985780135	0.051572012906223	0.09297640732614057	0.13240658056995935	0.15489293405984114	0.22877940561529517	0.33094401564591874	0.4047436032065266	0.4534397575324312	0.9561558542035979	1.207505425400451	1.2859713705882592	2.770486109859736	
"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y. Times crossword puzzle at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you don't have to "Pause" the DVD. Just let it roll, 'cause you won't be missing anything really important. No twists, turns, or tension. It's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It made very little difference. I've seen it all a zillion times before. Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family. Just the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze. <br /><br />It's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some the Bronx, and another Brooklyn. As a life-long New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos. They lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave. Some interaction with non-Latinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension. Remember West Side Story?<br /><br />And now for the oft-criticized cinematography. I don't know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me. The apt, the furniture, and the faces were all ORANGE. What was that supposed to mean? And the apt. did look pretty cramped to me. Somebody here mentioned that the old apt's/tenements had very big rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them. <br /><br />And another annoying thing ....This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy "jerking off". Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch? Please spare me! What's up with these directors? <br /><br />So "Victor Vargas" is a pleasant little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. But the writers let them down, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the "fast forward" button.	-9.563458253533355	-7.320706217808164	-5.236958265897572	-3.658941007080335	-3.089131016415502	-2.559866511658152	-2.4880269650236158	-1.0602388373475276	-0.8380555206683109	-0.5947333580904145	0.2532473839030422	0.42483925079591595	0.7129875260095957	0.7226626201380201	0.7244161186288703	0.7846540994422031	0.9891679430734129	1.1973355693909695	1.3151349292121561	1.4803991938643983	2.763155519014403	2.865253990045728	4.122078817584241	4.567141312688061	11.453572417840125	
There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.<br /><br />Why does Hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt? And why have they made a sequel?	-3.5159008132481295	-1.7289177842194232	-1.3717618732306485	-1.0854602690084598	-1.0544744978472325	-0.9266355331241438	-0.9226538152491144	-0.22700982303165346	-0.12117330027884216	-0.10245854171931817	-0.061130666303736016	0.010740448264934957	0.04590927173004672	0.08076316691199195	0.18010656813975046	0.3398543707342773	0.363397581871816	0.5165529355404744	0.6575539298902152	0.7455183149670697	0.7457849475409929	0.9782997221520955	1.2344565050832015	2.0822681870614406	3.8387623886522197	
I am an actor,producer, director and what i am about to say are facts. This project was the worst film in movie making history. From producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a BIG joke. Why would Blockbuster released such crap? I take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I don't think so. I seen bad Zombie movies, but this takes the cake the Coffie and everything on the damn table. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!! I really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself, but please consider in taking up a different profession. I respect the fact that you completed a movie, but i have to ask you " WERE YOU SMOKING CRACK ", I mean the makeup on your girls, the scary Zombies, what were you thinking. To the whole nation, if i could have voted Zero i would have.

Before seeing this movie, I would've said that I loved everything Kathy Bates has done. Now it's everything-minus-one. James Woods is pathetic...not his character, his acting. Someone should've told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, nor ignorant, nor cliche. Ditto for Randy Quaid's stereotyping. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess. If you enjoy the country, you'll enjoy the scenery. That's the best I can give it.<br /><br />I'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films, but this is simply terrible.	-1.7152649986823485	-1.660686983377303	-1.6325209103835914	-1.4991528460279944	-1.129473342234979	-0.8511099628423341	-0.8272819728629248	-0.7038988172185623	-0.22396174859093304	-0.19603841420112278	-0.10087433457238167	-0.08612580031656006	0.04777702617800603	0.10997663457933865	0.18709299658245182	0.24606508767503438	0.267144838277215	0.33811210165430283	0.5294383293890217	0.6118175994222781	0.7856084262293004	0.9764189865629465	1.5970934937951162	2.373913425992881	3.455344119124332	
What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band. This disc is NOT for the faint of heart...the music is incredibly intense, and VERY cool. What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so huge for so long. It is true that their records were great, but their shows were the top of the heap. In 1969 when this concert was shot, the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone and bands (and audiences) had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity--something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert out, it really is amazing.	-2.6385106856065734	-1.6722154512149823	-0.946849543577684	-0.9163254592794347	-0.8770139152269877	-0.1470933699822884	-0.042509275579142566	-0.037831571426238296	0.014205853529352108	0.08486905610408713	0.11115411035146364	0.23803334361694367	0.4822063400950993	0.5240657290665574	0.5907100813042616	0.7045119603913936	0.713666284578801	0.7846443496218886	0.825674748285163	0.8764514434167494	1.1913997287074027	1.3250132674260446	1.4479840541281879	1.8971265998692741	2.79962418755901	
Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. She has an amazing knack for accents, and she shows incredible skill in this film overall. I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted. She was played realistically, too. She got cranky, upset, and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt. I didn't expect much from the film initially, but I really got interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than I had anticipated. Sam Neill was also outstanding; this is the best work I've seen from him, and I've really liked him in other movies (The Piano, for example). I gave the film a 7, but if I could rate just the acting, I'd give the it a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for Streep.	-4.1470757807895025	-2.4319316159017337	-1.590296932663211	-1.1139518958225092	-0.7240556611527689	-0.5923602280807048	-0.5698824142267102	-0.37606935594250634	-0.14538152650162692	0.002442313184797603	0.34360732054440407	0.3663898971409203	0.9369282123631076	1.0022564756361316	1.07982502142265	1.1104029096713663	1.4668859089544826	1.9971246582086581	2.0337540313221023	2.3137279849501455	2.334967555843178	2.4714541750208214	2.5750823292984113	2.824318550425475	4.155093319182663	
Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.<br /><br />My sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie, they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces.<br /><br />After every Lnych movie I tell myself, again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name.<br /><br />So, you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time, don't watch it. But if you think that you need to kill someone, watch it, this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane.	-3.247561716035961	-1.5334285224636786	-1.4725850782894518	-1.3153261066627342	-1.0381221180610622	-1.0303786121576683	-1.0288880081510974	-0.4415838593743098	-0.2169705122957679	-0.19312573485859913	-0.19256449587303365	-0.1188280045741	-0.06622974407759419	0.1343970239227568	0.15652272199811718	0.33455664194353163	0.4020228104318987	0.4326641968079328	0.4624099056118127	0.6082498174807249	0.6601947673394392	0.7077362554624793	0.9496903127160246	1.9608139105596445	3.7511657078893137	
I watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before...<br /><br />There are more than a dozen modern stunning French films from en couer de hiver to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special. This film is one of them. A true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romane and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits.<br /><br />I am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters' own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched. <br /><br />Like most French and European films this story would never translate across the Atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without throttling the life out of it with the Hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation. Americans make brilliant films, but not of this type... perhaps if they let someone like a young Polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an English version...<br /><br />For those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss. For those who can read then you would be spiting yourself to miss films like this...<br /><br />I would describe this as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist. I think I saw him doing an add for four-and-twenty-pies. He thinks Romane Bohringer is a type of French Mayonnaise...It is arty in the way that Pulp Fiction is arty...but with more Gallic savoire faire...<br /><br />10 out of 10 with every viewing...and has anyone got Romane's phone number...she is the perfect French Salad Dressing...	-2.411922474631974	-1.437903402081322	-1.270392582160003	-1.0510596126267617	-0.9222924663450567	-0.8078371707295655	-0.6575268455440874	-0.18567240053030967	-0.12285449669852613	0.04870656693152368	0.1533393974570622	0.15855047268874417	0.1627753992268757	0.24060627791551825	0.33033602353231645	0.4614696509162257	0.48306421963919083	0.557321999453461	0.6689970812773796	0.686750174210224	1.4025184952286585	2.090980713147257	2.1539192289617004	2.3304322749589175	3.4126729457621283	
OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem, i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton's silent classic "7 Chances". Comedy, or acting in any genre for that much, is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before, if it's not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget, short time span of a film, they're handling things just fine. Regardless of what the credits say on their films, real "stooge-philes" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about the boys. Here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action. How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew but none others that I've seen in the last 35 years of watching TV. The critics will always "pooh pooh" The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others but then again...who ever remembers the critic's names or what they said? Simply watch, laugh and enjoy!	-1.9291524944786151	-1.875018768807537	-1.864346740649967	-1.0171520785387385	-0.673677289047067	-0.35203819715860685	-0.27398456002779537	-0.27191695635463375	-0.26865593483941774	-0.2482896976020949	-0.24045515231368986	-0.026948943686973974	0.12082733099700588	0.1890481738254191	0.32233975554774125	0.3735306694447789	0.40806804461048096	0.6300368055134338	0.6479342930354149	0.8438576198398046	0.8440123573320222	0.9414892998868828	1.8885338369934455	2.103994037349218	3.400391981853054	
I first discovered Alexander Korda's (1940) Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program. The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films. The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950's. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor. The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice, but not as it should be. NOW comes the M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002) issue. THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!! It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time. The only "Extras" are a Spanish Dubbed version, Sub-Titles in both English & Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one can only hope that Korda's FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Korda's JUNGLE BOOK (to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation) will soon follow on DVD.	-2.7325147951942035	-2.636690452679393	-2.306391653956753	-2.0529589050694614	-1.8923330752729752	-0.7523178932386954	-0.6573818427036514	-0.4862936595851696	-0.33106759447717027	-0.26831369525872883	0.18905356080973043	0.2595947973496293	0.277817361575415	0.32518820127727516	0.491544217022726	0.5577887493367496	0.5885474085254779	0.951851036280548	1.0447373498803607	1.2670417227475272	1.3031530263872029	1.5541002843628386	3.40170072989184	3.7570563951737417	5.724443358486504	
King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian, a street performer in 1930s China who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face-change opera. He has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance, and no one knows how he does it. He has a longing desire to have a grandson, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. We then go to the streets, and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them: some are even begging to take their daughters for free, because daughters are not worth much in this society. Wang Bianlian's story goes on from there.<br /><br />The film was so astonishingly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed. There is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place, no one wants a little girl. Also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman, and while he is famous and well-respected, he regards himself as something low, a half woman. As we go further into the film, the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents yet another beautiful performance.	-2.2377576133318553	-2.0214009306175456	-2.0121878693883595	-1.6765469037023875	-0.9610643931520375	-0.8370195057950818	-0.4565478061656326	-0.27934812979808377	-0.1810601862754414	0.02358257162364566	0.056463322171116825	0.20214065020228567	0.22654723028436446	0.26024433584127377	0.3710010130388238	0.4740375117551672	0.5067268596358754	1.06430483427198	1.1877086954592857	1.4705626404603518	1.942440670757255	2.376500627239689	2.9648350080039716	3.0045773194310694	4.384659319076061	
Whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac, debates about the life and military career of George Armstrong Custer continue down to the present day. They Died With Their Boots On presents certain facts of the Custer story and has taken liberty with others.<br /><br />He did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at West Point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to Brigadier General. His record leading the Michigan Regiment under his command was one of brilliance.<br /><br />It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years until The Little Big Horn. What's not known to today's audience is that Libby survived until 1933. During that time she was the custodian of the Custer legend. By dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way.<br /><br />I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to have the Custer career told in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have been made up the way Jeanette MacDonald was in Maytime, and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance. Even then the cracks in the Custer legend were appearing, but if done from Libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven.<br /><br />Sydney Greenstreet gave a fine performance as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing whatsoever to do with Custer, he was retired and replaced by George B. McClellan in late 1861 while Custer was still at West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful Winfield Scott. A nice Mexican War story should have been what they gave Greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old Fuss and Feathers.<br /><br />The film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of eight films they did together. The last scene they ever did for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. Both their performances, Olivia's especially, was a high point in their careers at Warner Brothers. We know through history that Custer is riding to his doom, that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy. If your eyes don't moisten you are made of marble. <br /><br />As history They Died With Their Boots On leaves a lot to be desired. As western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action, you can't beat this film at all.	-5.715311304544207	-3.713277650694406	-3.647154749323139	-2.895313413932469	-1.9992289003916006	-1.6267299658058612	-1.5811337897006117	-1.269541667335076	-0.5862833340000694	-0.29862830735557555	-0.2845006261277299	-0.1697891436442696	0.016108787046260842	0.6715711158268726	0.6802561710788058	0.8395266076837447	0.8449595916322341	0.9805356277553654	1.1143061880585972	1.8922984394548286	1.928594971244052	1.984019796669366	3.753409909760198	4.042036662725022	9.082438164943955	
Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters (Played by Jason Cadieux who is in for Jason Gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. This is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It is horrendous to watch and Gossett Jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces:Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do anything as long as he's working. As I look at his post Oscar win. Some of his better movies include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Considering that the latter two movies have him co-starring with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work. Of course Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best post-Oscar win work.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)	-4.712812996564027	-2.498355544334261	-2.2876392572412514	-2.032222913906276	-1.7789104240477818	-0.9547555734012859	-0.8439011636070978	-0.697985422087128	-0.5770355033931694	-0.4638377913910392	-0.24189213388188224	-0.1912976891740924	-0.09704973472737297	0.08685369437820974	0.154777883355359	0.5704858372749493	0.6331609313149215	0.6926833512527719	0.7217030062103301	0.8530643264486804	0.8633790652896055	0.9525130251206217	0.9689559647679302	2.7476670196116944	4.734773320881997	
Technically abominable (with audible "pops" between scenes)and awesomely amateurish, "Flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings amazingly true and Joe Dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives an utterly convincing performance. A curio, to be sure, but the more polished "Trash", made two years later, is a definite step forward. I suggest you watch that instead.

This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can and is likable in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very good and lovable in this different"sweet" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. However,i enjoyed this movie.The locales are nice,the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.	-1.105989238089117	-1.043995177472541	-0.8713280353168006	-0.714838714226784	-0.6253684497599801	-0.5843443920199423	-0.3098036274249949	-0.177326415426037	-0.17192604829321315	-0.04394303001156187	0.09393692748738612	0.10188366914513872	0.11459747401932235	0.11690682917878881	0.19617852835861316	0.31153314066239896	0.3223426477462208	0.33980204282215865	0.37200329672719085	0.5009237991137685	0.8625990781325523	0.8913588000678433	1.3332588264139418	1.3686136300036205	2.1246403155855393	
I saw this one remastered on DVD. It had a big picture of Sandra on it and said "Starring Sandra...." and made it seem like she had a big part in it. Not so. She's barely in it. She does what she can with the script, but that's not much. <br /><br />The sound was awful. By that I mean things didn't go together. Shots would be fired and the number of shots didn't correspond to the sound. People talking in a car while it's moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there's no motor noise, road noise, or any other sound. Kind of weird.<br /><br />Score was awful. It sounded like the same few notes over and over. Dialog really awful. <br /><br />Acting was awful, I couldn't believe any of it. Fight scenes were like a Batman comic without the "BIFF", and "BAM". They were really lame. The shooting scenes, I mean with firearms, were laughable, literally. I fast-forwarded through a lot of this movie. Even then, it was too long.	-8.995603760983826	-4.516523627343135	-3.394985244747255	-3.3485892020859875	-2.8350247030711833	-2.6320750556082753	-2.2262491486550964	-0.9367678857956078	-0.8550283169901569	-0.6534028624469318	-0.2710994151412728	-0.2666620490321289	0.059658394620514574	0.30646137811907653	0.424236369240007	0.6306358403336855	0.6887345820629676	0.7550084638927756	0.7574878132240308	1.1465950611008062	1.281373239682903	1.6703192215559177	2.936092604260227	4.5734805627044	9.000483030611234	
There are one or two other Shemp-era shorts I like more (i.e. SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think one can say--without much argument--that in this particular episode, Shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in 1946.<br /><br />Scene for scene, this episode hardly lets up: from Professor Shemp Howard's voice lessons with the glass-shattering Dee Green, to his futile attempts to win a dame's hand in marriage (this is your little snookums... will you marry me *click*) to the uproarious finish, it never fails to keep me in stitches.<br /><br />I would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (the always lovely Christine McIntyre). Btw, isn't she rather under-dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her 'Cousin' Basil? Who knows, maybe the actual Basil was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (as far as I know). >:-]	-3.0174286983599967	-1.5034066921631726	-1.4971251266453367	-1.4282971060485177	-1.3055191655414518	-0.4675357541998607	-0.4492720816397366	-0.4392119791491559	-0.3057025798232157	-0.24378403224131565	-0.22214344000746916	-0.21528997790971716	-0.16263486266268196	-0.07609463583793319	0.010026834343407093	0.046420028511476266	0.05389675933298905	0.22337742106363967	0.2310451935762331	0.32746436401425627	0.6306723925949522	0.7754660068704876	1.0460265263439608	1.624525137704912	3.093203711518388	
For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.	-4.976059972614669	-4.737667735224265	-2.38848539639032	-2.2351122027147587	-2.220706399939579	-0.3984210619087042	0.039640396070904416	0.09728953752787041	0.23964287306644527	0.28157144242198306	0.4077351405381045	0.4538448873298893	0.5862504113652842	0.6457435007842599	0.8449214863793392	1.0260885830593829	1.368049961235036	1.390896339203464	1.797773641131965	1.9001272647084302	2.000897547819743	2.2388008789574183	3.989637954611686	4.699153425325059	5.63376408968223	
An absolute classic !! The direction is flawless , the acting is just superb. Words fall short for this great work. The most definitive movie on Mumbai Police. This movie has stood the test of times.<br /><br />Om Puri gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment. This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society.<br /><br />This is the story of a cop (Om Puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai cops. Kudos to Nihalani !! <br /><br />After this movie a slew of Bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus. Thus this movie was truly a trend setter. This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade. <br /><br />This movie was a moderate box office hit. <br /><br />A must-see for discerning movie fans.	-3.1330547063165177	-2.51022213557294	-2.179423537713372	-2.1076841320731803	-1.3062140450422548	-0.9551373234221476	-0.4963453443346494	-0.48682983161910226	-0.4730500729410246	-0.32422750119678084	-0.3119847889667387	-0.29127687069343305	-0.228785254768653	-0.006791407498118157	0.4724076892055632	0.7181603668390217	0.7274062387110071	0.9149833546612689	1.381795526312274	1.61019141748655	1.8001413902859573	1.9298556051646756	2.9608465126007677	3.1799380485444755	4.053411805556294	
Narratives  whether written, visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who. This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema. Viewers like myself, however, don't have that problem because we see all our films on DVD or VHS.<br /><br />A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain (2001) and later in A Very Long Engagement (2004), both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters. This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways: more characters and more complexity.<br /><br />Now, other directors have used those techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is, first the director lets us 'see' inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different time periods.<br /><br />The basic  the core, so to speak  story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou) who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day. This occurs in the first few minutes of the film. The clever irony at this point is that Irene doesn't realize that the young man opposite (Gilbert Robin) may be that 'one true love'. And, nor does he...<br /><br />They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter. However, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet...<br /><br />If the story were simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even quite predictable. Not so. The script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again. Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen? Consider again what would happen...<br /><br />All of that is interesting enough. What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train. That kept me guessing for a while.<br /><br />I'll let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp.<br /><br />Recommended for all.	-4.51245366321316	-4.481633620061411	-3.548436271167093	-3.2744530058652326	-2.2763700705525616	-1.5472983972376317	-0.9846469043995052	-0.7848948568169511	-0.638358139261291	-0.6361214393675252	-0.12050613028236702	-0.024329092423257787	1.2143005334691766E-4	0.2577843649735357	0.46051417219362634	0.5464891656854639	0.5798875128848523	0.7366727739676471	1.4494088759704957	1.4659900000950876	1.786036527340575	1.9057999183569534	3.480774672619372	4.907345393530851	7.493937233697061	
I put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to NYC, and I couldn't believe I'd never heard of it anywhere! It has all the makings of a cult classic, starting with the characters. They are archetypal roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life, but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them (Peter Stormare and Bai Ling's performances were particularly strong). Their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle, quirky humor that is (sadly) all too rare in American films these days. Writer/director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past. Highly recommended!	-2.3303622179918158	-1.132519070341004	-0.9587340394447443	-0.9432492169280446	-0.6974091353887886	-0.19887580858671786	-0.05005915001194372	0.003791040948539104	0.04720878382052471	0.12470766246148084	0.244027250033933	0.4801246559731611	0.48342154079414956	0.5541175582660796	0.628570801661418	0.6774780481786488	0.7255755110259658	0.7375055001484001	0.7917874739786597	1.085461357526546	1.0952460062964857	1.542798834130905	1.6615368104302983	2.115745784189361	2.46732145378207	
Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special.<br /><br />If you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film. They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers.<br /><br />I've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. It doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.<br /><br />Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.	-1.662013069869626	-1.4287679372564224	-1.394949612071404	-1.040273336140779	-0.9688413806495983	-0.6850222516562716	-0.649972959229105	-0.4162283365340833	-0.17190358920909857	0.051560971473381706	0.11734549006664409	0.12051506426837788	0.23129523462279142	0.32056080916882157	0.3466751587641756	0.43486509896868203	0.43931598790614224	0.46801559179429664	0.6510714236302699	0.6578211074051219	0.6735122520808943	0.7450788845937513	2.0953551370861656	2.1005599253210385	3.319727797415859	
THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most "movergoers" were stay-at-homes watching their new 7" Motorola televisions. Almost all recent box office figures are false --- because they fail to adjust inflation. Obviously today's $10 movies will dominate. In 1951 it cost 90c to $1.60 at Radio City; 44c to 75c first run at Loew's Palace in Washington DC, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs. What counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unadjusted box office "media spin." The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. Instead, 90% of the movie's focus was on the music. Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place --- with Lanza's voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and not-fat Lanza pictured in the advertising. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $2.00 or less. Don't be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.	-4.994217961060677	-2.2801829348357736	-2.2789538577050084	-1.7850445047778927	-1.7161658864383507	-1.6941049369534789	-1.645923640656402	-0.5948835949468435	-0.5168334611377605	-0.488764722838627	-0.3716860800188986	-0.21272405253200227	0.29429494963697544	0.385450625750619	0.43685226809895533	0.491633609885107	0.5298039210543354	0.575444756371738	0.9625997605363418	1.0240169621202722	1.208364102341452	1.2230369591842423	1.4093731789082666	2.925313720656101	6.150795983764881	
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly. That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon. What?! That's a Rugby ball. The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football. Naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from El Paso. Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids. Hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />This movie stars Steve Guttenberg. Now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute. Guttenberg is rubbish. No, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie? I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea. Olivia d'Abo stars along side Steve and doesn't impress either. She merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it. Although I have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit. The child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this. Most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all. There's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie.	-10.111378039381218	-4.3077184789541585	-4.098573007200639	-3.9870074344981044	-3.9366351169316203	-2.811435986165467	-1.8121107635000262	-1.3315400686482635	-1.012836605905819	-0.7508513241842493	-0.5974482471559438	-0.30270350480014446	0.19041374230128383	0.23838966020426886	0.2522949913954916	0.4686171953765209	0.6055132199671812	0.7374010552579847	0.7546187318889238	1.110362284478165	1.7204186767387535	2.1808942577613126	3.8252814597704337	5.372135434324535	11.237596926546999	
I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of living in New York. I went on to live there for the next 26 years,but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie. It was part of a PBS series as I recall, and I've never forgotten it. <br /><br />There are no sex scenes to speak of, just delicate, moving, extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement, all set within a conservative, Boston (I think), World War 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war, and did not seek out a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail.<br /><br />There has to be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?	-2.728717971360284	-1.4331787550094506	-1.2331670180479768	-1.1604302890325242	-1.1373681887684732	-0.8614567892573712	-0.40178903500386615	-0.3774903539109052	-0.28050071026875345	-0.21979259024044806	-0.06415376330706629	0.013787202466484544	0.06108857645473002	0.08681802292038614	0.09524243206657274	0.09728328467110675	0.16290849901911897	0.2925439690951558	0.41972572169353883	0.4891202668749836	0.6988243658306909	0.8527775004766314	0.8999396260336402	2.178960129215859	3.7580984000603426	
I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. It doesn't wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. Kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. None of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. I will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screweyes's death(which still freaks me out) may be a tad on the scary side. But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most in-depth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes "I quit!" had me in stitches. My favourite is Screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent. If anything though, I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth. The script, while not Oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. The voice acting for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable. All in all, this is a good movie. I don't get the rating, honestly I don't. Sure this film isn't perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time, but it is good fun. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox	-5.640953454833962	-3.5724426015396333	-3.0722905892538157	-2.6322654294639984	-1.6197950981676814	-0.7783230777000582	-0.7355504049437176	-0.5008235901977198	-0.12024730269065792	-0.05684652588979425	0.15377550676816398	0.3028251012126495	0.32750731354274004	0.5325198570502336	0.5943171203274775	0.6484622198002186	1.0284925373675533	1.4980481163939852	2.1152178570499163	2.4472539165937723	2.9786788922684275	3.621833962088134	5.272795918599421	5.390741171885973	6.3767623241999525	
Now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have. WOW some demented Pokémon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this. Animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the Pokémon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film. It is just an animation it should be on video.<br /><br />Ps: i'll give it a 1 because i just got 5 bucks i could not give it a half because there's no halves.	-3.1578953979821143	-1.7534265840055916	-1.5836897472914935	-1.4383904782988952	-1.417729920890702	-0.7152976651811659	-0.6826350968884913	-0.6037536303010453	-0.526141393209248	-0.49756303478008707	-0.3785480027137126	-0.37056570500633	-0.11336449267844292	-0.0015329910346784381	0.30183293760779684	0.31241837197059397	0.32514319502175415	0.4051353960007335	0.41886822533255524	0.6721452368610017	0.7332662772980598	0.8154189141735514	1.1635151973376254	1.8416003680521746	3.268022469953273	
Way back in 1967, a certain director had no idea about a galaxy, far away or near. He was trying to complete a movie with the title THX etc. this short is a remanufactured history of a certain George. i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it. This is merely an advertising promo for the director, actors, et. al. It has little intrinsic artistic value. It is a brochure. The lead playing George, is very fine, as is the Leia character, and the ersatz Darth character. All else is plain commercial dross. What a waste. Still, it got the job done I guess. The rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time I guess. a brochure only.	-4.510026525978199	-3.0878197408055965	-2.0215392097329787	-1.9471801760680096	-1.6644288840937822	-1.142280019994634	-0.9569747650335093	-0.43623041708559496	-0.36169735524402	-0.2851810436439828	-0.21164849128736785	-0.034915291420623336	-0.007056701814242672	0.089573815028711	0.23717002008793597	0.4000529491567171	0.5275050682671869	0.6313764784477266	0.6475624562985324	0.6764624172905911	0.9568980278312853	1.5639885239741325	2.0045403817713026	2.469536142349603	5.641436748766865	
I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes started "taking over" the plane.<br /><br />At first I thought maybe it should get a "one" for the comic relief. But then I realized I could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more! <br /><br />Whatever respect I might have had for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are. When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that.<br /><br />This movie isn't worth a trip to Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your dumb ass.<br /><br />If you want to be really scared, I suggest the Descent. If you want humor, go to your local stand up comedy club. Their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash.	-6.18942581886824	-3.4678663296259775	-2.896894444417716	-2.882776485346532	-2.862603314424574	-1.550194316380074	-0.8178032727397906	-0.758988942361222	-0.6774249901597191	-0.510326528564506	-0.33689711733876754	-0.07645496931729998	0.0332073197963112	0.24675492451755487	0.3880739187030483	0.38923838892127555	0.6472404020852338	0.699293718617973	0.9852040595686132	1.189286064071316	1.2126958596344193	1.2909201428457655	1.8858697897034824	3.7504920349240027	6.868075638591434	
Not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is Paula Sage's touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline. This gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you've seen something special.(7/10)	-1.03118911808877	-1.0047844573618032	-0.5598698832295333	-0.22143455076400673	-0.19130129094029008	-0.18471334378348886	-0.14326147003142065	-0.0869139847613894	-0.06610960858872053	0.08235352763157439	0.08995565885307488	0.11408544468340005	0.21745040267674642	0.2231065688463977	0.22568037071245087	0.22873288911269862	0.24035252067459661	0.2621735554138702	0.2658933416869317	0.2768588163890267	0.28780110475734794	0.37577879396968317	0.3869761382623411	0.6417845711159013	1.0061632575857025

The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies. It is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. The casting couldn't have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in genies. And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high.<br /><br />..I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. This film is an adventure for all ages..no-one too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.S. was just about to enter WWII. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying "evilness" a few years later in "Casablanca." And Korda teamed up,I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers"....great film-making!	-3.227325471663919	-2.7467536718621686	-1.7224982283025283	-1.3756009917131418	-1.1251259636466229	-0.45177415395807874	-0.39740067103821297	-0.1599842123629417	0.1409619720750137	0.26613620962944173	0.26660806675604487	0.47539290478082935	0.5749480424293119	0.7173245763039606	0.7411795580188423	0.7632485281224768	0.7798911365379722	0.8061409665684431	0.8935881688396432	0.9680076678293519	1.3310969991753383	1.372120472063735	2.571787563127685	3.378100069064066	3.5642514811272417	
This is an entertaining look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) who sings a lot and narrates a bit also. If you like Johnny Cash, this film is quite enjoyable. Also note the blonde depiction of Jesus in this work...just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair...? Anyway, its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all.	-1.4450133689147187	-1.0577657362066435	-0.3363254963327037	-0.3360645336937014	-0.2731836014251193	-0.20951099182970342	-0.10440320792007574	-0.004529829109675976	0.06285072577788556	0.13049080711596284	0.13274295645172796	0.13811929637458534	0.1737072852921103	0.18177247959767764	0.2557883628615743	0.26233081439129247	0.4283765597451456	0.45235702040185105	0.48477507741778625	0.6154606850033889	0.6748003070776467	0.7396105487819715	0.9747082137937276	1.2069190059636703	1.6753265125407761	
I just saw this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival. After the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the Director, Tian-Ming Wu. He (through a translator) told several stories about his life and the making of the film.<br /><br />All tangents aside, both of my children really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory.<br /><br />I won't give anything away, but the bottom line is that this film is SO MUCH better than 95% of the Hollywood crap (especially children's films) out there.<br /><br />Cheers.<br /><br />p.s. There is a "real"/original King of Masks who can/could do 12 masks at once. The actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time (then they would cut and change to 4 new masks).	-2.5607815195015378	-2.124152341186109	-1.4165787079405452	-1.2561871502982636	-1.0735302439222043	-0.7504934647175906	-0.7107863136953518	-0.5502437342045038	-0.46970941546750244	-0.30428259824803183	-0.21411517399242663	-0.07349204637967752	-0.035380864791669416	-0.003189956484083642	0.012130704190060876	0.11310933324042968	0.17580853434705307	0.30523915460543727	0.8988238347899867	0.9146970079372394	1.0315740989019124	1.0590431332309822	1.4210519908277595	2.3257338252716844	3.9677827685171656	
I figured that it's about time I let this one out. Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. Why? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television. So what is their problem when it comes to the movies? Honestly now, I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies. They are all enjoyable and fun to watch. And, after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters, I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts. The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says `Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap.<br /><br />*possible spoilers from here on*<br /><br />Well, I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. My first gripe with this came with no narration. I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together. This wouldn't have been a problem, except for one thing. Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end? Possibly the fans, but I'm sure not the parents. Then, there's the theme song. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one. The Japanese theme song was `Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children. It was fun and enjoyable. This one: nauseating. Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana. Nice music, fun to watch. That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pokémon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary. Oh, and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath. You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But, I haven't touched on the worst of it yet.<br /><br />You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power. For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were `well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.' That in mind, I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, `You will believe that one person can make all the difference.' With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version. Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words `the main feature 'The Power of One.' At that point, I became a bit more uneasy. `The Power of One?!' Not a good sign. However, I still kept some of my false faith. Big mistake.<br /><br />Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB. However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie. First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read `the world turns to Ash.' Ah hah. So, Ash is the chosen one? Whatever. In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time, he's the chosen one. A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia. Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia. In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash. In the scene where they're flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference. Overall in this category, Ash wasn't really the `one person' that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way.<br /><br />A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one. Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection `started with a Mew card?' Ugh. Even worse, Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held. `Why didn't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them? This is like caging them to be displayed.' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket. Some pretty funny lines. Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well, that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well. Forget you, Kids WB and 4Kids. You have forsaken me for the last time.	-23.015319292726012	-17.033932213809074	-11.44589542937589	-9.844154535616543	-8.841376263996725	-5.698061169589704	-4.9557141658665635	-2.583572105726692	-0.7004426413217217	-0.28316463482301474	0.007385581008587758	0.16167461257581567	1.349140581523382	1.357592962988501	2.111898039983416	2.2378692697533364	2.4321460396981123	3.685802788121998	3.7318945006115674	3.8805643127429876	4.67321194850007	8.04874576324022	9.751609920508505	14.715333326993228	31.68845261160508	
The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads 'KUSHIATA KYOTO, JAPAN 1840'. A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori (Toshiya Maruyama) walks up the winding path to the house, inside waits Otami (Mako Hattori) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband, Shugoro's (Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki) back who happens to be Masanori's teacher. Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other. His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide. Over a century later and Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura (Susan George) and their young daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their close friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay, you don't need me to you where! He jokingly says it's going so cheap because it's haunted, to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts, at least for the time being that is. Almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode. Lights turn on and off by themselves, Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk (Henry Mitowa) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore, of course. The spirits of Otami, Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches (Tsuyako Olajima) curse put upon them. But there may be a way they can break the curse, unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage, daughter and possibly even their very lives. <br /><br />Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film, OK to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it. Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either. The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by-the-numbers, a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things. There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter, Noriko (Mayumi Umeda). And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in, however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in, some exorcism! One more thing, I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this, try his hand at Kung-Fu and oriental sword fighting! George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure, although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present. Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there's no blood, gore or violence to speak about. The 'transparent' ghost effects are OK but they ain't going to impress many people these days. It's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the Japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in America, England or any Western country without having to change a thing. An OK time waster.	-12.415361230290998	-5.822866184224359	-5.515584975274452	-5.377502296818458	-5.287140931663539	-3.5827213458529084	-1.757627976470717	-1.2100547117095453	-1.0537532301071293	-0.9797115325702086	-0.7821327545577197	-0.3550098089741665	0.04736455824990898	0.161715258838778	0.3065260314212556	0.6844985503489054	0.875598365183772	1.2438558845703365	1.4959688095416894	1.9126541389432554	2.0364894390181405	2.06489624891729	4.842519420030667	6.808957557317382	13.53920031087857	
Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.<br /><br />A group of top quality actors, in the main well cast (with a couple of notable exceptions), who give pretty good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana. All do well with the scripts they were given.<br /><br />So much for the good. The average would include the sets. Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it. It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big. In the later parts, the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon.<br /><br />Now to the bad. The screenplay. This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives, blinded. He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why?? Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a man besotted and passionately in love, is prepared to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak. Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers. Whilst Miss Mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful, I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward. The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list.<br /><br />There is a sequel (which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story. It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased.	-7.664211392782576	-4.105776559902308	-3.8602517430797123	-3.1559874854417345	-3.0412918507312012	-2.3106402411541573	-2.2498670423963905	-0.3495163294584759	-0.22726349726945927	-0.2111183872508381	-0.017725418823144323	0.13792507679070995	0.5261121787897243	0.5743874949260149	0.6227842417059511	0.6658203149354582	0.8256651787960672	0.9133023955777929	1.6330924169285115	1.7926228556637591	2.1511941881055825	2.712585372842459	2.72923112140203	4.757111395215249	10.518976028188485	
I found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while I tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why. One of the problems is the cultural/language one. Here we have a Chinese/Taiwanese/Japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading English subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad Miiki film and this certainly is not that. Plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence, a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect. All in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one.	-2.600959940535599	-1.3717753662057992	-1.3206007825666233	-1.3179534254608911	-0.9787790476528674	-0.7834029748215898	-0.7673311667531083	-0.4808810354765015	-0.07898950486597878	-0.07682442718243859	-0.04271503456577191	-0.020406121320656185	0.10762987378675166	0.15166954839353572	0.22325966147596576	0.2354808790831091	0.25307367481390813	0.37280417202732846	0.3936186336649609	0.45276521958013527	0.6064961320298283	0.6879357673608599	0.780190020497801	1.5792304942976114	2.991592033222165	
One of the lamer wedding movies you'll see. Smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters. The ethnic stereotypes are like a Henny Youngman joke, except they just aint in the least bit funny here. Molly Ringwald, well what else needs to be said. Give you a clue to the silliness, she destroys a $10,000 wedding dress, because "It just won't be me" makes it into this rag, with straps and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy, rather than ringwalding her neck. Its a helluva a cast too, check out how heavy Ally Sheedy is.

Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.	-3.6216390387983495	-2.3812579522761754	-1.7217294951145616	-1.3607369749241767	-1.0904840039015398	-0.29351874369053865	-0.21395732758926225	-0.10495058655119428	0.014516997272796803	0.1000195574847918	0.3492773406478543	0.6010378204609983	0.6361444376738615	0.6916750978622478	0.7001015243327237	0.7501274715396153	1.0269002078626337	1.1978034654053975	1.232919620787603	1.46677293781997	1.5761211001747484	1.5790269241592774	2.3122085951519216	2.6197018393696507	3.6629053662402526	
I saw the second part of this beautiful period piece set on a ship sometime in the 19th century. Golding's book must be responsible for some of the superb dialogue but everything else was good too! I especially liked the way they created the period and feeling of being on the ship so well. For me this had a feeling of completeness about it which I know I won't be able to convey in words... Perhaps it was the way they mixed in technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteen hundreds to the story without messing it up. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. It's not often a mini-series sends me to the "zone", but this one did.	-2.1124228895054924	-1.377373940815725	-1.256272037528234	-0.9621757369282354	-0.7458992348103453	-0.39007634428154975	-0.33184740275769875	-0.2622776411185937	-0.1533089141507512	-0.01119322107330978	0.12680164490312984	0.16046007936101	0.22841456326174614	0.3054033348126235	0.35427430236948393	0.3565065584887298	0.5351735759248236	0.6400524920621538	0.7318892243919066	0.7626435041225337	0.9893806408215867	1.0555293307464848	1.7650686251321837	1.9151076144746704	2.0796048092891053	
What is it about the French? First, they (apparently) like Jerry Lewis a lot more than the US does. Second, they (seem) to like Edgar Allan Poe's work more than just about anyone else does. It's got to be the "Beaudelaire effect".<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...I'm a Poe fan myself. But this trilogy manages to make three of Poe's below-average stories into...well, I'm not sure what they're made into.<br /><br />"Toby Dammit" is a fine Fellini film, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of theme. It's enjoyable on the first viewing. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, it has nothing whatsoever to do with Poe or spirits of the dead.<br /><br />"Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How did Vadim's films get produced? It's just awful...not even up to amateur film school standards. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try to skip it and save your time.<br /><br />"William Wilson" is actually the segment that is most faithful to Poe's work. It does not have much style, though, even if it includes the strangest snowball fight I think that I have ever seen on film. (It looks like the boys are throwing tissues, or maybe handkerchiefs, that have been rolled up into balls.) <br /><br />My advice is to skip "Metzergenstein", watch "William Wilson", and then, if you're a Fellini fan (I'm not) keep "Toby Dammit" on while you cook dinner or make a snack.	-5.01944428406956	-3.53945064051795	-3.0867592917931685	-2.9748254852932376	-2.8649840123093604	-2.128680645892992	-1.3589222468759679	-1.199008010952912	-0.4047567860276133	0.03270658370267705	0.2739062914941216	0.2773636852301522	0.28278586996678035	0.3368225427869815	0.34096549962723444	0.3753147281956524	0.5506638277084082	0.645589233977642	0.7580559170976358	0.7728552824855726	0.801960758737641	1.5961107910923613	1.771579601107211	3.7517987127071506	7.851697593106765	
This is a movie you'll either love or hate. I loved it. If you are looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc. you won't find it in this movie. It is a feel good movie, sentimental, positive, uplifting. The heroes of the movie are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I guess I didn't find this movie to be "sentimental hogwash" as so many did, because it felt very real to me. I know people like these. I've seen jocks who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable. I've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. I've seen people who think high school football is serious business. I've seen people who know what really is important in life. Any of these people could have been people I knew. I did laugh; I did cry. I left the movie feeling good, remembering that there are people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there aren't people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. If you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature, you'll hate it.	-5.172579989553507	-2.229008345751521	-2.0990561516007866	-2.0677126323469897	-1.4939774729504411	-1.3461927089920562	-0.6644335756318371	-0.5091775732957876	-0.39905253540605423	-0.0010125757803114976	0.010827557315156777	0.017302822964308205	0.18539180013046128	0.257658271937443	0.4655131733772475	0.6494294723497582	0.7164055533195948	0.9985719361315628	1.1028721296069124	1.3752222711246251	1.4788247423948506	1.4949128942182865	3.867366883705111	4.401116910680127	5.435551715737134	
Nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account other Barker's movies, which never lack originality. An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references. Certainly a lot of fun to have, a a bit to think about, if one cares to. And, not to forget, a nice music score. Well, the special effects, as usual, get old faster than anything, but that is probably the only drawback. I've just seen it again after ten years, and I still find it something to recommend.	-2.1869844783893573	-2.062058334743727	-1.1182768429624887	-0.549003790819517	-0.35157958847646714	-0.13906998856812197	-0.023917423438058236	0.05164057996513233	0.07132579114412455	0.0785786592878305	0.19269235790198402	0.20355204459132137	0.23615865681992493	0.35152276237390756	0.46021903282319354	0.5031102359799181	0.6615445813727523	0.708429114066155	0.8499395220066128	1.1016966090456788	1.1880381048541369	1.4897140200562473	1.6178579972541836	1.9378339446641382	2.706620044710727	
i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging. the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the movie and it's women with raccoon masks on. zero special effects...and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet. the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie. the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a "cult classic"...however, i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this film is how bad it is. i'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film again!	-3.6163930290887016	-2.0031913546475604	-1.9357159253005873	-1.8210271903142723	-1.6918197592406625	-0.7451902145933277	-0.5349839394526149	-0.42249910485208075	-0.41850154209511253	-0.3347754988409318	-0.20303981714759636	-0.19868649754113316	-0.19523826758216614	-0.04197845767460832	0.03642160746578218	0.11592405018921137	0.12047685970550068	0.4230547887384891	0.506921452598706	0.7258250246206176	0.7331605495387155	0.7756744810701656	1.088419842463579	1.9342780190360054	3.66286916980336	
A film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception - It's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second crack at 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is his most under-rated film, and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right.<br /><br />This is, in more ways than one, Doris Day's film. Not only does she give the finest performance of her career, more than holding her own against James Stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. This is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider: Day's Jo McKenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. But look at the way Stewart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage over her concerns about Louis Bernard, implying that she is jealous that Bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career. This is clearly a recurrent joke between them - she responds with a 'har-de-har-har' that denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement, and that they both realise it.<br /><br />After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This is a cruel scene, brilliantly played by both actors, which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage - he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions, in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career.<br /><br />The potency of that voice is demonstrated in the Ambrose Chapel sequence, when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges - they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent. At the Albert Hall, it is her need to cry out, to exercise those impressive lungs, that saves a man's life, and in the Embassy finale, it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son. By contrast, all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive - his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the Albert Hall, and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed, thus depriving the Police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice, in the rescue of Hank from the embassy, that he actually succeeds in doing something useful.<br /><br />Far from being forced into the film to give Day an opportunity to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical device in the film, foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the McKennas; 'the future's not ours to see' indeed. It also neatly prepares the way for the finale, in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow Doris to save the day.<br /><br />The most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature - the build up to the assassination attempt in the Albert Hall. This lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing Hitchcock committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually. We see people conduct conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. We don't need to - the images say everything. It is also his most exquisite suspense sequence, with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight, matched to the music perfectly. There isn't a frame out of place - anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is playing out. It builds slowly, but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable. When Jo screams, it isn't just a relief for her, but for the audience.<br /><br />The Ambrose Chapel sequence is witty, and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick-in-the-mud Nonconformist church. The Embassy sequence seems a little flat after the Albert Hall one that preceded it on first viewing, but second time around actually seems more effective, with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of Day singing in the background, reminiscent of the music-as-ambient-noise in 'Rear Window'. The score as a whole is subtle, allowing the music from on-screen sources to be foregrounded effectively.<br /><br />Bernard Miles is a low-key villain, a little banal, but with a dry wit. He's outshone by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin - her stance is pure gangster's moll, belying the Middle-England exterior, but she clearly has a soft side, and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank.<br /><br />Stewart is excellent, although if Hitchcock really did always cast him as 'Everyman', as the Director's daughter seems to think, then it confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in Rear Window and an obsessive necrophiliac in Vertigo. Day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never overdoes anything, but neither does she sell it short. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget what the stakes are for the McKennas; they feel the most fully human of all his central characters.	-8.965959794302917	-6.624691280481546	-6.617649991101228	-6.538823441625488	-3.5737615185985563	-3.445064466289713	-2.4259131429819063	-1.7644770571013348	-0.9198766757322507	-0.18997455679949657	-0.18528573695311445	0.3215500017590381	0.48844106538367094	1.235134269812747	1.5786316621570173	2.011877402847846	2.105451253559079	2.4836747776896844	2.5117876478458165	3.1882213324364646	3.382872560062391	4.556772891633152	9.474774163068359	10.160169604051333	13.649279062308826	
Does anyone else think that "Reba" is basically a ripoff of "Roseanne"? Just look at the characters from the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who's married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and the quirky relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /><br />And then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough-love style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as Roseanne had. Or, perhaps, they made her *too* lovable, for Reba Hart seems to waver between being mean and scary (hence Van's line to his wife Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") and being sweet and caring with little transition in between. Roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind, since she was always mean and sarcastic and, whenever she tried to open up, it was hard for her. As inconsistent as Reba's character is, it's hard for her to be believable. <br /><br />But even if the characters weren't completely ripped off of "Roseanne", nothing could've saved the show from being sub-par in the plot area. The writers try to give the show substance but they really can't lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact. And you'd better believe the jokes are corny; it's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old who thinks that any joke is hilarious. While occasionally they come out with something that's funny (I don't pretend that I didn't laugh at a few episodes) these gems are too few and far between to make "Reba" witty. <br /><br />Overall, "Reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of "Roseanne", sub-par plots and sub-sub-par humor, and (let's face it) terrible acting. The show might be a bit better, actually, if they replaced all the actors, especially Reba herself, who is more community- theater quality than prime-time sitcom quality. <br /><br />I give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in.	-7.375410204012683	-3.5923353715769037	-3.2768816851425306	-3.06385680698215	-2.9902369917768103	-2.5777175913073975	-2.5173128123465807	-0.5576871059927411	-0.34046984438431377	-0.3157507980122616	-0.2762691487565915	-0.1521359521397077	-0.018053075244566154	0.19777638464293873	0.30470737225487154	0.42121912181822924	0.5034173200930514	0.515523457623576	0.5448997182171833	0.6625415172332318	0.8237862814798212	1.197417643080336	3.049637669302437	3.9214162483787294	8.506626979619437	
Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary.<br /><br />This film is ... well ... I guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits (apart from the acting, plot, story, sets, dialogue and sound). I wrongly assumed it was about zombies. <br /><br />Watching it is actually quite scary in fairness; you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home-made amateur torture videos or something along those lines. <br /><br />I'm so taken aback I'm writing this review on my mobile so I don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered. <br /><br />I worst film I've ever seen and I can say (with hand on heart) it will never, never be topped.	-2.5626714745075914	-1.7259445260467494	-1.569850161531611	-1.5554158929930932	-1.2564689618921596	-0.7087730434003516	-0.38203141188050704	-0.3409677840114129	-0.2832965221971433	-0.262442599758145	-0.25535685888698234	-0.2458516029773335	-0.2141136127856807	-0.18278196368375565	-0.060785184800713724	0.04693150699196683	0.2412423654605716	0.24294738540339494	0.41710572770530796	0.5458616701416844	0.6653154562805905	0.7289002626390914	1.056100264058385	1.9621399613287274	2.843982818361532	
"The Last American Virgin", along with "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is one the last great teen films ever made. It is tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties. Much-maligned by critics that it was a sophomoric, banal attempt to recreate the magic of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", these same critics fail to recognize that the two films were actually filmed concurrently during late 1981, and released at only slight intervals from one another. Either way, the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues many male teenagers are confronted with as they reach their sexual maturity. Especially considering the heart-wrenching discovery the protagonist, Gary is confronted with in the end. American Pie this is not. The story revolves around a trio of male teenagers, and their mostly unsuccessful sexual pursuits. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the tagline LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly, Gary lusts after Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen begin having sex, and Karen gets pregnant, only to be dumped by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility which lies before him. Gary glides into help Karen, which leads to the aforementioned, unexpected conclusion. Overall as a film, I find it was very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and a remarkable coming of age tale dealing with issues such as envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are just as pertinent today as they were over twenty years ago. Also, it has one of the rockingest soundtracks ever made!!!	-2.936306053939634	-1.8814946454403043	-1.8181904835576703	-1.634321932203672	-1.0210070892569036	-0.9924437087417309	-0.4565907310903612	-0.4177263356375114	-0.2701190349383076	-0.13494164380738877	-0.11878884415378846	0.024875723314614198	0.13881371809071769	0.2381223500735762	0.3027123170011524	0.3751315351241508	0.5050129967502208	0.5887111349976307	0.7808153010819431	0.8654654892320771	1.0424822442782453	1.71764114493883	2.905113584026035	3.2406645450679727	4.309618934973897	
Sure, this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés, but it's entertaining, and that's what I watch movies for. To be entertained. Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with the short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty can't be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure the women love him. The two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film. I don't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I guess we see what we want to see.<br /><br />Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even if d'Abo's British accent did creep into her supposed Bronx speech. To tell you the truth I hadn't really noticed it until I read these comments, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me, but she was ideal for her role with that one exception. <br /><br />It's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others, but who find their soul mates in one another. It may be an unlikely story, but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries? It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube. That's why we watch them, to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen. I thought these actors did a good job of it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily. Don't get me wrong though, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had plenty of those.<br /><br />I give it 9/10 only because I'm saving my 10/10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that I know will come along some day. If you see it advertised as coming up on the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or whatever, make a note to watch it. I think you'll like it.	-3.0007294678374485	-2.7425130639217596	-2.45992881428515	-2.3966311114855956	-1.961872163861714	-0.6661109211554943	-0.5638396550401987	-0.36967508764091256	-0.2683768157733111	-0.10573600305799019	-0.047706420485303686	0.04239942856248756	0.11028901054214604	0.29869223582887244	0.3782320851250084	0.4021697701646945	0.7268641119903064	1.0180074186035886	1.1655500417105664	1.357845992620714	1.3920730732819255	2.4350200701926408	3.410482685788706	3.907942209340262	6.049311403957592	
"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps "A Cry in the Dark" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.	-2.4471205938264293	-1.2560981707273913	-1.1705316655066988	-1.0467083045331353	-0.7309579635996909	-0.38558805091067533	-0.36838933051998035	-0.31193019046250153	-0.08354159408647333	-0.06256158623034112	-0.046534074325290775	0.3030006889397545	0.3041760388318079	0.5620527618122408	0.5700003593691884	0.6572087713686492	0.7529214964327416	0.7538151994415905	0.7756461569358835	0.8415859133302604	0.8809030677416322	1.06085488444092	2.090415355512764	2.1739320100712534	2.485836893103115	
The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, part of Mengele's experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. The movie obviously had great reviews. It's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about.<br /><br />I too, for a large part of the movie, got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on. One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center, the meaning of the word "forgive" is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own" But by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more. After the "strong-willed" Eva Kor forgives her "Nazi captors" the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of Kor. The movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory. To me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her "act of forgiveness". Obviously, it was a very sick cow.<br /><br />On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the "promised land" to meet with some Arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis, including one at a Jewish center in Chicago. From then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.<br /><br />Firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was. A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan (Professor of education at Bethlehem University) gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.<br /><br />Finally, the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago, where she is "grilled" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.<br /><br />I will cut to the chase. By the end of the movie, I was hoping I hadn't chosen to watch the movie. The movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears. It showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion. Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.<br /><br />Lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? Quoting another IMDb user, "I don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go." That would be the perfect layman's definition of MAKING PEACE.<br /><br />I guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have "gone through more than the human mind can fathom".<br /><br />P.S. The dictionary certainly should go into all those Books-to-buy lists everyone keeps making.	-13.142111782587941	-5.84867481129069	-5.324233989857813	-4.8667656147039535	-4.6654016616014164	-4.209283419252563	-3.5675339916433515	-1.3694304597949845	-1.230292650543902	-1.149966735360059	-0.8641426827734302	-0.172941597109926	0.0905584973810283	0.48055359194369823	0.9989275836092111	1.1281472015558158	1.2826174783567073	1.6010239087357037	1.7490523408535694	1.897673705626576	2.1972971497581932	2.2183204733325947	5.199737403522116	7.046978319135273	14.497689146667362	
I saw this film for the first time last night. I have been thinking about it all night and this morning. I cannot say that it was my favorite film, at least not yet. I need to see it again. <br /><br />The cinematography is stunning. Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Wim Wenders's name attached to it.<br /><br />It is always tempting to see de Chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom, but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the Italo-Greek painter. He is slightly menacing, a presence who watches and, in his capacity as a film director, exerts influence on the entire story. <br /><br />The dedicated Wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of Damiel and Cassiel wandering through the streets of Berlin, watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. And, following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor, the angel (or in this case Malkovich the Director) gets to interact with one of the stories. <br /><br />At this point I have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far. I need to see the movie again. I am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together. <br /><br />Perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious, empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication. Maybe that is the whole point of it. No one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework.<br /><br />We must be careful when throwing around the word "pretentious." It is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension, but that leads to a terrifying mental state, one in which the only conversation seen as genuine, earthy or authentic is the most banal. When we shun all discussions of philosophy, God, existence, meaning and all that brain candy, we are setting our culture up to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. It certainly is not the only theme of the film, but I think that it cannot be ignored.<br /><br />The other (and most obvious) leitmotif is that of satisfaction. There is a lot here on that, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the 1000 word limit for this review.<br /><br />My advice is to see the film. But I offer a caveat: it is not an autonomous film (at least I don't think so yet). Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages is one of those films.	-8.210164757573535	-4.9784812975904895	-4.662663971005983	-4.005208987595657	-2.5036734504549827	-2.242319994958427	-2.158842320744526	-1.6461097825198732	-0.4764693610956068	-0.32169829036009595	-0.10922169299316425	0.09010121989957169	0.1624161664266998	0.421258076262472	0.5311536228859112	0.5386258727176424	0.9604300622036207	1.3809191454659173	1.3847978987808507	1.792642119887024	1.9468258126586124	1.9487295130693074	3.5475772663895975	5.55399232797522	10.40137231388068	
Mario Lanza, of course, is "The Great Caruso" in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today.<br /><br />The film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you're a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from "Lucia" will strike you as odd - even if Caruso's wife Dorothy just had a baby girl. Also it's highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him.<br /><br />In taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in "Girl of the Golden West," There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. The reason for that photo? His only shirt was in the laundry. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.<br /><br />Instead, the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha, which never happened. He had a hemorrhage during "L'Elisir d'amore" at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when it says on the screen "suggested by Dorothy Caruso's biography of her husband," that's what it was - suggested. What is true is that Dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage, and left her $1 of his massive estate. They also did have a daughter Gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). However, Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy.<br /><br />Some people say that Lanza's voice is remarkably like Caruso's, but just listen to Caruso sing in the film "Match Point" -- Caruso's voice is remarkably unlike Lanza's. In fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, Caruso could have sung as a baritone. He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not. Lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music. He sings the music in "The Great Caruso" with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. His acting is natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself.<br /><br />Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.	-6.282089272343829	-5.108208729017077	-4.550541467926534	-3.7052949810884317	-2.287048959959482	-1.8856836069959735	-1.8844460967623717	-1.0338700079458747	-0.7295176057880531	-0.07875606572199258	0.08248048784534559	0.09116285169666355	0.17915013272568653	0.17930536438569755	0.41921329234656174	0.6579810226787904	0.7119985886163358	1.0704500666890135	1.6553620667741566	2.03914390789362	2.3552132894276308	3.2721994358933566	4.548216254816798	6.31201120555763	11.531859978062904

This movie was okay, but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born that way," especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman. It almost seems as if Kate's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch, making this film seem a little simplistic.<br /><br />Also, as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as "bigots." And there was no happy medium. It was either Kate's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her. This is not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make. Sadly, the movie showed none of these types of interactions. For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, it struck me as very intolerant movie! Then at the end, Kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory - is that what being gay is really all about?

This film got roasted by the boys at MST3K, but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low-budget film noir. The plot is tight, the characters are believable (within the good-boy-gets-obsessed-with-bad-girl genre), the pacing is solid, the climax is well-handled, and the cast is bolstered by several fine character actors. True, most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but he's actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind. The scenes between him and his dad are quite powerful, in a minimalist kind of way. Sure it's depressing, but that's the point. Good movie.	-2.5520418093626946	-1.6375359790766935	-0.9856180798776303	-0.9604079767134868	-0.5607853144368842	-0.42914179127337115	-0.2510274061695622	-0.1978055905442927	-0.1362735277002598	-0.0317759184972394	0.007552749677800431	0.3973322252911884	0.4075197589450756	0.5467865547371732	0.5654658852605506	0.6891507860161454	0.7738378337806786	1.054387569704008	1.056627604330618	1.1508236798526177	1.2919593160160086	1.3886808538911704	1.4025315877601252	1.7482699119735607	2.2434818608934446	
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise.<br /><br />A miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. Predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues.<br /><br />The staple of roman porno is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh. A masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening (via condom) is too little kink to late.<br /><br />The series' rain motif continues and the film's final scene brings relief.	-3.918033398757004	-2.217439654340958	-2.1451347145526807	-2.0455530211393653	-1.818493073727338	-0.7041528039088615	-0.4487651259365543	-0.3306998842510632	-0.2991491219877489	-0.26991581046215296	-0.13781112984226984	-0.09441349825285827	-0.07698405793914961	0.012788781629523238	0.11176947870365388	0.29339854279191924	0.29518899161243406	0.5142778086242844	0.6076459281592247	0.8848749113204485	0.9116909613054789	1.092697409608058	1.210502865443746	2.541883863753352	4.8167890699115565	
"A wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone, not always he that has done something."--Emperor Marcus Aurelius <br /><br />The DVD release of "Watch on the Rhine" could not come at a better moment. It restores to us a major Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett (Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dick's audio commentary affirms his authorship). It presents a subtle performance by Bette Davis, who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros. lot. Equally significantly, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose.<br /><br />Sure, you say, like we needed that. We've heard Cary Grant sermonizing in "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in "The Sound of Music" (1965). We've toured an England callously occupied by Germany in "It Happened Here" (1966). Yet, truth to tell, we still need the message spread.<br /><br />I have an 81-year-old friend who curses Franklin Roosevelt regularly. He feels that FDR connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we didn't need, and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin. He's encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leaders and the trivializing of War Two by Patrick Buchanan.<br /><br />The political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that Adolf Hitler would have posed no further menace to Poland, Europe, or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan holds that if those selfish Poles hadn't confronted the Nazis, drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.<br /><br />Some commenters on this site feel that "Watch" sags under the weight of stale propaganda. Maybe. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have gotten the film's point: Some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land, goods, and liberty; such people dominated the Axis Powers and "enough" didn't appear in their vocabulary.<br /><br />Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors. They give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines, for actively facing down torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman didn't care for Lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical. Of course, as a Hungarian he had seen first-hand Bela Kun's bloody "dictatorship of the proletariat" replace an outmoded empire and then topple to Admiral Horthy's right-wing tyranny.<br /><br />In a marvelous cameo role added to the play by Hammett, Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot of July 20th against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he pragmatically abets the Nazi cause, although he insults Herr Blecher "the Butcher" and scorns the Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on an Underground leader.<br /><br />Teck, a pauper and possible cuckold, wishes cash and a visa to return to Europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire-shattering Great War and the greater world-wide economic Depression. He has no political convictions, no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends this burnt-out case's Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace.<br /><br />Lucille Watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess, a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way--but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. She and her pallid office-bound son belong to the American version of von Ramme's and de Brancovis' privileged kind. However, this family hasn't seen ruin and never will. They're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it.<br /><br />This mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit Buchanan. "Watch on the Rhine" has a manicured period look. Its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets. Yet Hellman and Hammett's film has gut-based power. Audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march.	-14.38734710791988	-6.942275987032573	-6.776169033708928	-5.109779303747423	-4.968010009615806	-4.76870902043027	-3.560987264766791	-2.4753060796963755	-0.5746267556179842	-0.19984291890679173	-0.18448821053904696	0.04209762522909386	0.16106125830588786	0.36000936029979813	0.49857829481040633	0.9578347021703398	1.2366989832766806	1.6726257135260132	2.637231560909419	3.03509581100758	3.114047256076428	3.724471133527212	4.309043091698185	7.971338452824646	17.212436777388824	
Documentaries about fans are always mishmashes, and never worth seeing through, but I found this one, made by some of the fans themselves, more than usually unenlightening. As a veteran of the original Tolkien craze, forty years ago, I'd hoped for more than the obvious--which doesn't always equate to the true. If there's anyone living who doesn't already know the nature of a fandom, any fandom, from having been or known a fan, he won't discover it here. Between irrelevancies, platitudes (to which the actors from the films are particularly prone), and acting out (by fans making the most--if not the best--of their one shot at fame), I could glean little of the special appeal of LOTR, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take. In addition, the film is rather lazy: it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort, e.g. what the exact legal loophole was (the wording of a copyright notice) that permitted the books' unauthorized publication in the U.S. (Speaking of which: I take strong exception to the film's dismissal of the covers on that edition as "irrelevant" and "psychedelic," which they were not. They were the work of Jack Gaughan, a very able sf illustrator of the period, and some fans, including me, found them more apt, and more attractive, than the covers on the rival set.)	-1.4312947085292822	-1.2587932062916132	-1.2189253318596993	-1.1772457786612416	-1.0236716974962068	-0.9442361916969658	-0.7981131797487739	-0.39869156503549685	-0.3901910571027413	-0.35471914147803785	-0.2852857183134935	-0.18245494328237888	0.03834776874801925	0.16188244080188782	0.1686843986784285	0.317711922767561	0.3375627976955893	0.3643821428078978	0.5006812875579957	0.8828878417192096	1.3113673074584768	1.375074238822632	1.5233280533483537	1.5914879539233557	2.8696037566826655	
Seeing this movie was the most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. However, I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. This picture has everything any movie could ever have. It has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist self-conscious art film. It's all in there, adding up to a myth.<br /><br />The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), happily living in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. At one point, the story borrows from "Not without my baby," but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice.<br /><br />The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khan's dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie. In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.<br /><br />Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion. Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar. Nana Patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character.<br /><br />The movie is not without its share of realism. Violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions. At times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic.<br /><br />I have seen a share of Bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. But "Shakti" raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained. It is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. Perhaps, the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but I came out of watching "Shakti" exhilarated. Making movies can be the most fun in the world!	-4.734608466344592	-4.539297975994146	-3.9914052508345903	-3.934973469719298	-2.2923368551404377	-2.1785082150850807	-2.1258542311904565	-0.9181144807553061	-0.3299807915520462	-0.006362408364878447	0.17187292471193857	0.32546747020418926	0.5165627870830414	0.6847587891399007	0.9149360765799016	1.1883390369267017	1.5224530583178715	1.6497883588735547	2.1049277125465635	2.1153046913811453	2.292710044092083	3.0586734081426346	6.2975038226456865	6.470033282728086	8.815638541611714	
Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The Man Who Who Knew Too Much," is usually not considered to be as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best films ever. I prefer it over "Vertigo" and "Rear Window."<br /><br />Like "North By Northwest," it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy. He will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family.<br /><br />While the original was good for it's time, it is hard to watch by today's standards. The remake has excellent production quality, an endearing Doris Day, and a really creepy villain. <br /><br />Don't bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over.	-1.5282118387996757	-1.4976128423482857	-1.1896282943433394	-0.8687731013214909	-0.37685748889028664	-0.30428302699157617	-0.29948107445515215	-0.15611122066136834	-0.11648720631870599	-0.0871289700348424	0.005491263612158688	0.01750461433330594	0.13507262771876577	0.2210800294509483	0.23284200155315568	0.2585358934814759	0.34947182638711405	0.525660213418667	0.534571912948697	0.6054724360665751	0.6912151099445575	0.9112591031379642	1.3366511329623363	2.060898903557597	2.2795562365173603	
I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick. The shonky production values and low-rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci-fi channel style knock offs.<br /><br />The central performance from Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act. The rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever.<br /><br />The cinematography is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kind of films. It doesn't even manage a decent bit of convincing gore, the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film.<br /><br />The film tries to inject originality and a message into it's concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards Islam and the war on terror. This is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a 6 year old. As the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion - describing all people of a certain skin colour as "muslims." Most notably one character is revealed to be Muslim by skin colour alone. At the same time the "muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /><br />Presumably the far far superior Pontypool had a similar budget as Dead Air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably.	-6.690784029082333	-3.2359932880084874	-3.1208026231999533	-3.069411668764464	-2.608453187444987	-1.8326557441079858	-1.5983469926891072	-0.6819043634008027	-0.6547747993587621	-0.4711760201057166	-0.4108555811317237	-0.21394747402325207	-0.17019209220562398	0.13510802135464997	0.20782211813131402	0.23273128177492322	0.24945482814864545	0.32495654967257476	0.6982871455283635	0.8499322591367413	1.2157944787040067	1.6534578042976849	2.8348680146089267	3.2705217875086707	6.906506251670282	
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack--illegally, I suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on DVD in the US format, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the very best on Oppenheimer, or the Manhattan Project, or virtually anything produced by the BBC.	-1.4114553186891083	-0.8093357141939095	-0.6269704306210195	-0.5202047439126676	-0.4736718750285283	-0.4591339191220216	-0.4200513094768892	-0.22961192026534297	-0.1920872146629398	-0.14394301470716908	-0.0624247420037351	-0.05418038484773485	-0.05189117676795954	-0.03855547602615499	-0.011266917574331556	0.12781985589581335	0.14204084697256705	0.17915729510463235	0.2633875096841607	0.31408556477362104	0.34039036401418543	0.38546651989881664	0.5474404995093186	0.7822370834069232	1.582744222002283	
Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.	-4.976412263430504	-1.9386620613136507	-1.9366100687381105	-1.768922386109745	-1.6672896076211705	-1.6269995285592296	-1.2670611522986486	-0.8056001603752578	-0.6239916232967357	-0.41878734608862594	-0.256863835812504	-0.072297684760189	0.08430711889284027	0.10646466726030829	0.2875892698936433	0.40870373910103763	0.41519841717192574	0.4619926274996492	0.6792244143602342	0.8246909783459156	0.8263217897625758	0.8401901357191022	2.099250917355013	2.136680809637709	5.221735265969124

This sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters. So, there are a lot of flashbacks, of re-shooting of the same scene. But, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result! <br /><br />And it would worth it, because it's for me, just one the best French movie ever made! <br /><br />It has everything: <br /><br />Cast: first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard-of-hearing! It's symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie!<br /><br />Directing: his camera is bright, alive, plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close-up "à la David Lynch".<br /><br />Cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love!<br /><br />A never-seen before Paris: It's a Paris out-of-time of more accurately, a composite of a lot of districts! Huge search here! It's look like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! <br /><br />Music: Not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! <br /><br />Ah,  the story! As I said, it's a love story but rather tragic: Saying that love can be for nothing, that it doesn't make all people happy or isn't guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn't often told! Love is passion, which is derivative from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when you are in love! Because of the Why .. ?, of the endless waiting, the lack of courage, the indecision. <br /><br />And when you can ease yourself, fate, destiny, god (?), devil (?) can stab you in the back , just because you arrive too soon or too late, and above all, because love means 2 in a world of billions! A lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written! So, what's love? <br /><br />Personally, I lived some moments like this: in a car with the dear one. Her mobile rings and you know it's her "special friend" whom she kisses goodbye (and not you, even if we are always together). So, you want to go out of this car to leave them together, to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can't, because an amazing hard rain just started! <br /><br />I found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else!	-5.464312626840184	-5.2675351190520585	-4.888929044254199	-3.4579145134682285	-2.8136618214010367	-1.3706283021054113	-1.3190826355893228	-1.1107031176963058	-0.928511428530912	-0.8817625255138973	-0.8692090055065604	0.04038139573604122	0.10096312748731094	0.6579629831226848	0.8763323791463778	1.3158005098249546	1.38384415010237	1.5061600452344641	1.7322897745031034	2.2377027472433304	2.4399901063361247	2.7103655384117884	5.410081631820511	6.134969980063411	7.572831870464349	
The "Amazing Mr. Williams" stars Melvyn Douglas, who did five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who ALSO did five films that year, THREE of which they made together! Douglas is Lt. Williams, and he and his co-horts are presented with a dead body, and they must figure out what really happened. Viewers will recognize his co-workers - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) always played positions of authority... senators, bank presidents, policemen. This who-dunnit has a flair of comedy to it -- the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other, and even Williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally. Some fun gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend. There's a lot of fun stuff in here, so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on. Don't want to give away any spoilers, so you'll have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies. Director Alexander Hall made mostly comedies, and was reportedly engaged to Lucy at some point.	-2.853273668515433	-1.5830867833228663	-1.3236971516512128	-1.3089962007190687	-1.239795093033133	-0.8573000398062309	-0.8445350023344278	-0.44736038858053784	-0.39762383369203846	-0.3002122301844256	-0.0415795331835683	-0.03354494767949396	0.06405053250378341	0.1134909390848648	0.1198557511438805	0.18567363769214998	0.372301705613863	0.39897936644390164	0.5424201011229548	0.5980529963974194	0.6338090548647244	0.8372136430835355	1.4550002369510024	1.8553149691300572	3.652443632458393	
This isn't the comedic Robin Williams, nor is it the quirky/insane Robin Williams of recent thriller fame. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love of the thriller. But this isn't a thriller, per se. This is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which Williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.<br /><br />Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report, until William's character gets close to achieving his goal.<br /><br />I must say that I was highly entertained, though this movie fails to teach, guide, inspect, or amuse. It felt more like I was watching a guy (Williams), as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective. In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare.<br /><br />It rates a 7.7/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.	-2.624771704998107	-2.2977019510219736	-2.023278223801133	-1.5602390421903105	-1.5028977121607165	-1.1553692611693316	-0.7605032209655096	-0.38993354183751844	-0.2924529098482709	-0.2553324548500119	-0.24638273462711013	-0.10899875652434432	-0.005618749965732167	0.14385593912686448	0.168174833191439	0.2562045109114958	0.391935081624107	0.5363652951925498	0.8667997171150302	0.8959263566758641	1.0611257437926822	1.2485293194836768	1.7346786449143232	2.957728334043873	4.146785956722689	
It a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an Asian background does NOT EVEN SHOW ONE ASIAN OR AFRICAN person, not even as an extra. That fact probably describes Norwegian race relations in general. - However.<br /><br />NO SPOILERS - ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />Buddy portrays four young people living in a flat-share in Oslo. The protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion, and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up. The narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models. Quite the cliché. Although the story is mildly funny, the acting is good and as a 'young person' one can sort of identify with the characters `crazy' situations and complicated love affairs, I don't find the story or the characters very believable. To polished and lacking in depth. This film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `Friends' (yes that show on TV).<br /><br />Has Norwegian film finally found its identity?: Audience pleasers in well known American style.<br /><br />How about watching Lukas Moodysson's Tillsammans (Together).	-2.7492477193314655	-2.4283736156331166	-1.8122321821715084	-1.3324785574163098	-0.7039056300378473	-0.5846846483431665	-0.46954563595408355	-0.30708872353983274	-0.23795856473583127	-0.20988235783149262	-0.11826045001220312	-0.09064759386959666	-0.0715299930410511	0.12104298845038892	0.15028862289660805	0.34471117720667166	0.3723215860593839	0.6803028219768539	0.7675853246108681	0.9902664953393094	1.0174678591481252	1.175016667823738	1.985283408695491	2.6828943981903395	4.6079387347734775	
Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All", a British series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that is able to be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was "Danger UXB". A series about defusing UneXploded Bombs, hence the name. That one you can get from your local library.<br /><br />Pete	-1.974545343729395	-1.437060537973548	-1.165915932729936	-0.9629437675688896	-0.6546162522349606	-0.612724803410386	-0.5145913602260437	-0.46907460721598504	-0.2927462664486886	-0.07094406615143112	-0.06412851068082863	0.013750404008202433	0.026260437846010398	0.18292853180806246	0.2160308662574263	0.23155832465066506	0.2732075656794273	0.32323688770868153	0.4149836010256671	0.46874542722837226	0.501711773455624	0.582250573609695	1.1114642153242105	1.4790411542477049	3.004061750623707	
What if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot?<br /><br />Well, I think it would probably end up a little bit like this one. I don't think I've ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed (at the beginning) to complete crap (by the end). I only stuck with it, because I kept thinking it couldn't possibly get worse. Well, up until the very end, "Necrophagus"/"Graveyard of Horror" proved me wrong.<br /><br />Who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard-man, evil grave-robbing cultists, and mad scientists tossed in for no discernible reason could suck this bad? One would think there'd at least be some humor value... but not here.	-4.156066107364487	-2.087107925351654	-1.7891669635538596	-1.5636644979842196	-1.476718019466536	-1.3288535251322298	-1.2354306224273968	-0.47634465932774817	-0.16011806723870645	-0.05904664180980003	-0.03953231630266286	-0.019349945100438963	0.03114916126715383	0.04507378619644503	0.15752978302499457	0.15963604471095794	0.16710663510122123	0.20520507605003402	0.3523894023922369	0.5830867743322333	0.6670401049656105	1.0201318564486157	2.055389900870514	2.440062501332996	4.803098363438309	
I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But perhaps that was because I never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, I have to say it was no way better than number 5. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's PG-13. The acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects. But the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore (the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight, but come on..)<br /><br />Surprisingly, both Parts 4 and 5 were directed by Sequel-director Jeff Burr who gave us the excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I liked Puppet Master: The Legacy, even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies.<br /><br />Overall, Puppet Master is very much like the Hellraiser Series: A great trilogy but forget the rest..	-4.312721487190038	-2.2306053407034487	-2.2056096639612246	-2.169981606838016	-2.1680341329246615	-1.6926315798069096	-1.1990697077899761	-0.9654945940483353	-0.6628493587946385	-0.24230527338072066	-0.2352239248886586	-0.02847136961587629	0.05890210330639195	0.2314185538763533	0.2715906067139768	0.3132618477620047	0.6464227957039805	0.6711932877320615	0.7075352695169385	0.7166793058544437	0.9268604547407493	1.0817462199205583	1.51759437315246	3.1075039498510346	5.4617091625579155	
... in search of the cheesiest "so bad it's good" movie, I've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films, only to be left disappointed and bored at the end. Not this time!!! My eyes teared up, my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie. Sure, Hulk Hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable, but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this - all anyone wants to see when renting this is Hogan breaking out a can of whoopass, with a bunch of "YEAH BROTHER"s and "WHATCHUGONNADO"s flying from his infamously goateed mouth. And while the Hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the Hulkster in the ring, seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick. A laugh riot.	-2.7636503453382137	-1.6012290620246925	-1.5706522164330161	-1.3210262426572619	-1.1146792596810022	-1.0028838190716032	-0.8348965616357715	-0.41556024257470375	-0.22743339910478483	-0.11899654222435985	-0.06393115588240789	0.0021503942426614048	0.051392338542108534	0.1410225706684444	0.14712491638618572	0.2412162577464017	0.260904701361426	0.44449186257593054	0.5612733454073884	0.5825048252191507	0.6720380615263707	0.6875257170973985	0.7370691554565925	2.1167092933937957	3.3262063580642733	
Yet another early film from Alfred Hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation. As with Juno and the Paycock, you can tell that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or craft to it at all. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage. Emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted, wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband. This might seem more believable if Fred weren't made out to be a completely insensitive, pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. That's about all you can say for this one.	-2.8391771872218294	-2.388286725049002	-1.6730343557509204	-1.612036990141237	-0.9276267197650472	-0.8093090075748836	-0.7076766295107525	-0.22023570495291783	-0.20423932980965467	-0.02544458524963894	0.02984966566001674	0.14786969909160202	0.17671150169130193	0.21115135447427613	0.2280416572376831	0.3487924574203337	0.38899773853855485	0.3895806973850508	0.5353607238207055	0.6490797936453488	0.7937255141980445	1.0615944328641245	1.782186319227004	2.133204874131688	4.246640439225081	
This is a very moving movie about life itself. The challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand. It should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans, and while some of us are gifted with a mind, heart and sound body, there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky, or maybe, we're the unlucky ones. We don't always see the beauty in the world because we're wrapped up in our 'blind' ambitions, and see it only in one light "what can this world do for me!!!". Maybe we all wish we were like Radio, a loving happy individual...who loves everyone.	-1.599081716244194	-1.5745147859088127	-0.6206379835203487	-0.604107670137293	-0.538100589780736	-0.40601944384462324	-0.22090379910215108	-0.20252362316145262	-0.026857452200764687	0.0069336189663221914	0.052414351302236886	0.13383276745486894	0.153547409369837	0.15908666011048786	0.16986154491177918	0.19715994199622844	0.31287853201826465	0.34638291600047744	0.3661682841843712	0.3816940018777609	0.41739631074482	0.4760260575337938	0.5336075769872595	0.8366194717332589	1.1829278855837102	
Why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down? It is cute and funny (exactly what it is meant to be). Madonna wasn't out to prove herself as an Oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow! She was just doing what the character called for, and she did it well. I loved her in this movie; it is my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. The soundtrack is excellent too. It is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80's flick. To all the critics, just don't take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it. Madonna is a goddess!!!	-2.0702965164647105	-1.8749917279269488	-1.4130502275834547	-1.3160689966971386	-0.7955844389290189	-0.3270983903686403	-0.1954223640114754	-0.19006913411357043	-0.16235767028659953	0.007124141031582959	0.1297235319062654	0.13104634597437131	0.22248377650991058	0.2813147052366981	0.45412743040907133	0.5643433885975166	0.5891243947873046	0.6457686724566114	0.8938549298221523	0.9004513040385376	1.0259694179102559	1.087981719949558	2.5243039000873515	2.6744318032328995	3.1924927857795815	
Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.<br /><br />The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred. One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic. With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned. Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed. The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help. The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own. The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle. Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.<br /><br />Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real. The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk. The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations. In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'. Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic. Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912. The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do. The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted. Everything of the time was very formal. Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie. Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken. The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.<br /><br />A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night. In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic. Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed. As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.<br /><br />Technically the film is very well done. To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage. This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.<br /><br />Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.<br /><br />	-21.32065963737202	-12.594775084152596	-10.105960069405652	-9.598655758873715	-6.877654176102642	-6.8688478110436675	-6.02974783952964	-2.2572832988785487	-1.2334345249145737	-1.1018495456682624	-0.714766563590409	-0.5795222550992348	1.2281916505974568	2.0569872683406576	2.1735489704596955	2.420078077955809	2.4976625888577777	2.9096956136930583	3.895150747863829	4.133221899793858	5.856087841798508	7.256988959880373	9.38691720012097	14.003944389995837	30.540800586936058	
I thought this was a really well written film. I've heard of Radio the person before this movie was even created and I can't begin to describe how good Cuba Gooding Jr was in it.

ALERT: This review contains major SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to see this film.<br /><br />Judging from the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth one) very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-woman's federation called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring skill and acting ability. Unfortunately, the LPWA closed down in the early 90s, so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as Mimi to start an acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative to stuff like this? This movie is really bad. As it was going along, I kept comparing it to an underrated movie called `Survivor Quest,' only this film lacks everything that made `Survivor Quest' enjoyable.<br /><br />As I started the tape, I went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape. At first, I wasn't paying much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for a movie starring Mimi Lesseos. `Oh,' I thought, `here's another movie featuring Mimi to look for.' But as the preview dragged on, I became aware that is was a preview for.'Beyond Fear!' You know you're in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch! The plot of this thing is pretty standard. Lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer that is living with the guilt of injuring an opponent/friend, so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend Sammy: being a wilderness guide. On this particular occasion, she gets a troop of three couples. Two of the couples are just there to take up space. You think that one couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife, will be explored, as an issue appears between them halfway through the film, but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods, which consistently scares the Korean wife. The joke is funny the first time you hear it, but it certainly isn't by the ninth time they do it. The third couple is just painful to watch: it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They trade insults back and forth, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he's not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly wife.just like your typical American couple! Before the hike, Mr. Page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out Mr. Page taped it. So begins the peril, as the two guys track the group on their trip, and we wait.and wait.and wait.and wait for them to finally do something. When they do, it's a fiasco.<br /><br />You can't blame the cast. They try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with. The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons, who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the director's chair. Lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy, sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the entire shoot. There's even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some nighttime scenes. Then there is the sound department. The music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your television's speaker. Don't bump your head on the screen! It isn't worth it to hear the poorly written lines. Speaking of poor writing, Lesseos gets some of the credit there as co-writer. The few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes. Early on, Lesseos knocks out a thug with a switchblade knife, so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs. When the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by Lesseos in a well done and long fight, our cast all have a huge laugh together, despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy in the end. Everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film, wishing for the good old glory days when Mimi performed in the wrestling ring.

Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this awful country singer attempting comedy. They might as well call this show "Generic", because that's what it is. It's dumb and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck, and so does Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12 year old who got knocked up. You all suck, and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals. And she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her "music" in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst show ever, Reba is gay, I do not like her, I think The Office is better than this show, and this show sucks.	-5.681577831920158	-3.0561119276133626	-2.860092429211872	-2.683933105159759	-2.5137299713116903	-1.3457317899331	-1.3405735070661589	-0.5964743091808529	-0.4906426043726147	-0.36475681267295657	-0.1639134142754109	0.01258157610850405	0.12156409331231659	0.13747605304285015	0.1677936972407182	0.2800583419077633	0.47604540033753906	0.6351934728298292	0.6478303506437247	0.6733075159539412	0.9413960863886162	1.0549159693735233	1.9912092955122038	3.4848836941379924	6.236998742256741	
Well...tremors I, the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however, they proceeded to make tremors II and III. Trust me, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one, i mean, ass blasters??? Now, only God himself is capable of answering the question "why in Gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?" Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie, for it lives up to more than that. As i attempted to sit though it, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly, i would never suggest buying this movie, i mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.	-3.2487551217758406	-1.6678713761681423	-1.6023659692935646	-1.2832389883729634	-1.1798267420198356	-1.1102279454410526	-0.9594736818059876	-0.5131735860667213	-0.3779632359671238	-0.36366496371257184	-0.2712245858611059	-0.007983970694192793	0.010000323214819959	0.07808896365269992	0.2100623307986678	0.2762811340994383	0.2811444137461865	0.37527388774773046	0.4181493717427621	0.4626603282221956	0.6689500617306962	0.8107297488025816	0.9614924009075749	1.9616165037461237	4.156974934574618	
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists. Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original. Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.	-0.6268671834486157	-0.6077499929087532	-0.5121352819131414	-0.5095136501264671	-0.3910359638509284	-0.2737683288714703	-0.26030582944930614	-0.1833780420178524	-0.10271600172663384	-0.09192487445150235	-0.08814318598841309	-0.06271243873513455	-0.04277874239403895	-0.027088310594903686	-0.011973043829633143	-0.0011421511128453209	0.05204476697202921	0.08399730934572325	0.16255972466886975	0.33301671246330455	0.38635453224469785	0.596518921777238	0.6440434036706947	0.7341845078134113	1.132398420312839	
This series just gets worse and worse. Poorly written and just plain not funny! The premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines through. By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone. Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about, and resorted to that patronizing, smug, "Oh, silly you" style acting that comes with a no laugh script. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say, aren't we zany? Isn't this funny? Well, no, it's not actually. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV. Come on CBC you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateurish mess.	-5.935446834991536	-2.9240876880410642	-2.7560033239062984	-2.7269230248085528	-2.494240779457523	-1.8931233116395854	-1.5873221337616437	-0.8066749174021054	-0.5982928652992354	-0.35416282807185173	-0.16608513030783015	-0.12757958974474395	-0.07568627649723847	-0.027924905761281385	0.06001916893706014	0.07314785451023663	0.311713408747143	0.558544928172896	0.8046255512600178	1.0065752223174709	1.4067931030684193	1.9828084579295024	2.0627155499827405	3.651522855736708	7.039640517263953	
It was awful plain and simple. What was their message? Where was the movie going with this? It has all the ingredients of a sub-B grade movie. From plotless storyline the bad acting to the cheesey slow-mo cinematography. I'd sooner watch a movie I've already seen like Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, even Grease. There are NO likeable characters. In the end you just want everyone to die already. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.	-3.0715909952682385	-2.395888714944855	-1.6782338351648411	-1.651044655169812	-1.2812380804250187	-1.1699885310242826	-1.103960140772363	-0.3785009430700937	-0.3503226614428051	-0.2755690222306738	0.0016882328799290025	0.09906139135870248	0.13746596364461405	0.14993795233519241	0.21236608593218312	0.21815548874198848	0.24128076741256752	0.37779159552100605	0.5753502290950337	0.7362115050326481	0.7618278914227444	0.8582524030866743	1.1980552382772893	2.3481492272134923	4.120042010609876	
No Holds Barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of arnold schwarzenegger. But then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so gullible to have liked it. You feel cheated, embarrassed, and stupid. If you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it's gay, give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday.	-1.3852496845089468	-1.1464406610179982	-0.8525569457347235	-0.7397265446868351	-0.7327863561960443	-0.5334889567653063	-0.42796145518990397	-0.2407918242443578	-0.1627978518044389	0.021634953910261295	0.046658326087125335	0.05357771907403694	0.06124340664548329	0.0781381561958445	0.09518582117838482	0.11754789378064436	0.11989991235503232	0.16382132416887607	0.19545454028955236	0.2615694918120247	0.3647574030907309	0.4604967668155712	0.6811039064876608	1.0825432800991606	1.9911355018804768	
George Armstrong Custer is known through history as an inept General who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of Little Big Horn. "They Died with their boots on," paints a different picture of General Custer. In this movie he is portrayed as a Flamboyant soldier whose mistakes, and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure.<br /><br />Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at West Point. Custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow this never appears to bother Custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments. In spite of his poor standing, he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the United States Army. Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in rank. Before this can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment into battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, Libby who is played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the Seventh Regiment of the Cavalry. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux . When that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers.<br /><br />Errol Flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. He successfully portrays Custer as being flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. Olivia De Havilland's depiction of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender, more gentle side. The Chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who had acted together in several other movies, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of Custer and his wife. The other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott , Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining.<br /><br />The reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie. While it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. The movie has a little bit of everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a large variety of audiences. The casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact. The reviewer especially likes that the Native Americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land.<br /><br />	-4.882060522116336	-4.708126059651434	-4.608212335587194	-4.030017391493422	-3.238996929175785	-2.0620591894237457	-1.5367504828582226	-0.8679723196990138	-0.5739263137852831	-0.10979931631207389	-0.07450297119982335	0.118296216279306	0.27630085301441387	0.6095238792881258	0.6674631496268932	1.1952381088686583	1.4944910567603444	1.5710938122085136	1.6003879279056152	1.894794310853104	2.995061981658564	3.001050259374412	5.735263239905197	6.4062043640646404	9.974397087950683	
I found it hard to like anyone in this film. The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better. But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their life's tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions. It's not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it's merely an account of a true story that happened there. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.<br /><br />When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one's life. The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.<br /><br />The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers. To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter. Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press? How much of the downward spiral could've been prevented had she behaved more to the public's liking in the media? Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of film-making. But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy. What is infuriating is that it's not that difficult. Apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case. Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.<br /><br />Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophie's Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph. It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself. She frustrates us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling. It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her, but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the public's attention.<br /><br />She is married to a pastor, and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most. Initially, they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to God's will, kick-starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part. Whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify, so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well...<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen, but the Australian public plays the real leads here. Like punctuation for each plot advance, director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.<br /><br />This Golan-Globus docudrama is not particularly memorable. The setting's atmosphere doesn't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out. But it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public.	-11.000317841315255	-5.531579102239293	-4.85451771071053	-4.507765364659778	-4.24146712012077	-3.141043462098821	-3.13149916335116	-1.0928852805648814	-1.085887464204307	-1.0741127553397558	-0.6294528792614983	-0.138065359758397	-0.07312527579412237	0.7418528882337756	0.8082191566095261	1.2378921130281832	1.303741369833888	1.3130503164653786	1.3876950759451858	2.2390920991521615	2.2729010330960238	2.2801064256454042	3.1128058161727883	6.719705981226257	13.743765802682809	
"Are You in the House Alone?" belongs to the pre-cable TV days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is well-made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a High School student who gets a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is the High School Principal and Dennis Quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid. It's a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. Beller is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters. Blythe Danner, who I usually don't like, gives a truly moving performance. Nice little film.	-2.536865094249854	-1.8824687171124908	-1.502868013534727	-1.1465108058293152	-0.8368263207352985	-0.6796059379411217	-0.33280921423574117	0.10917877423869908	0.21259752830787484	0.25444540786467906	0.280816849726258	0.36068748554392416	0.3939929808644871	0.4398018225725309	0.5260575955939183	0.54763309406127	0.6647651544073246	0.7563951258368091	0.8664635226020104	1.063617662360234	1.1059384390817177	1.4210260878612002	2.0898032824211765	2.285094812830763	2.8023381770680547	
Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty good film. A bit different.

When a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash, his spinster twin sister, Martha Craig (Madge Kennedy), doesn't believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive (even though self-snuff runs in the family) but his three beautiful daughters couldn't care less. The pilot, Jim Norton (John Bromfield), goes to work for Valerie Craig (Kathleen Hughes) who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister, Lorna (Sara Shane) and the family lawyer (Jess Barker). Valerie wants Norton to seduce Lorna when he's not fending off the advances of another sister, the nymphet Vicki (Marla English), but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when Norton falls for his prey. All bets are off as a world of woe -including corporate chicanery, seductions, suicides, blackmail, a murder plot, the Mann Act, double-crosses, disfigurement, and poetic justice- befall "Craig Manor", an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea...<br /><br />This preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for WRITTEN ON THE WIND, also from 1956. Douglas Sirk's saga of a powerful (and powerfully dysfunctional) oil clan was said to have inspired the 1980s night-time TV serial DALLAS but the Craig's low-brow excursion into insanity seems right out of it's sinful sister-soap, DYNASTY. All three siblings (only one of whom is really bad) are great beauties but it's Kathleen Hughes' cartoon villainy that stands out. Valerie is relentless in her quest to inherit the family fortune and her unbridled enthusiasm for evil is one of the movie's many guilty pleasures. Teenage sister Vicki is quite a piece of work as well, reminiscent of Carmen Sternwood in THE BIG SLEEP. When they first meet, she pulls the equivalent of trying to sit on Norton's lap while he's still standing by coming on to him with the line "I graduated summa cum laude from Embrace-able U." Whew!<br /><br />THREE BAD SISTERS, produced by schlockmeister Howard W. Koch, is a terrific trash-wallow in exploitation excess and the cast is B-Movie Heaven: Marla "She Creature" English, 50s hunk John "Revenge Of The Creature" Bromfield (once married to French sexpot Corinne Calvet), Universal starlet Sara Shane (discovered by Hedy Lamarr), Jess "Mr. Susan Hayward" Barker, Kathleen "It Came From Outer Space" Hughes, and former silent screen star Madge Kennedy give it all they've got -however much or little that is. Future Eurotrash star Brett Halsey (TRUMPET OF THE Apocalypse) is seen briefly as one of Vicki's victims.<br /><br />B-Movie rating: 10/10 Marla (and her body English) made marvelous movies! THREE BAD SISTERS was recently seen on the big screen as part of the Palm Springs Film Noir Festival but the jury's still wiping soap suds out of ...aw hell, it's noir (5/10 on the noirometer).	-6.278140531364432	-3.9005965977464117	-3.503676329024059	-3.356562252027498	-2.9189358821476783	-1.0682457733717905	-0.8597105518122617	-0.811903944288155	-0.7192691868333044	-0.3308239769211748	-0.3172551921985637	-0.2852737743548481	-0.16347385683995821	0.05318276743937107	0.15948833398648699	0.249229467859521	0.4054522572790765	0.704905619725208	0.8986257440655432	1.2818864158131034	1.572842569657563	1.6635319020545074	2.001701931446269	4.094348204818353	6.7308589175496945	
This show made me feel physically sick, and totally detached from British society as a whole. It was programmes such as this and Blue Peter that pretended that there were/are no class divisions in Britain. They'd always say things like; "Go into your loft and you may find this.." or "Go into your back garden tonight and..." - what about us 'scummy' working class kids who never never had a "loft", and a "back garden" which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block? Public service broadcasting - yeah right! And on top of that, it was awfully depressing to see those stupid, middle class, up-their-own-backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having 'fun'... do me a favour, and "why don't you" go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on "Mama and Papa's" money... you make me sick	-2.228417077784936	-1.8753535725897303	-1.3003233698237417	-1.0209950709749562	-0.890335196677025	-0.661253699674549	-0.4414250723510749	-0.37056967783385003	-0.3701191712039444	0.02509591478977965	0.09201866056874389	0.16450285370186257	0.17106073748261585	0.17168641400294743	0.17232198589209435	0.28432945827472045	0.2853874735153227	0.30392708811700475	0.32974450881962714	0.3457387133565076	0.8066357490393717	0.9716475172078676	0.9823684237389555	1.4257611105700265	2.6218617253936145	
Dull, flatly-directed "comedy" has zero laughs and wastes a great cast. Alan Alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows. Newcomer Anthony LaPaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it's not enough.<br /><br />One of those scripts that, if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer, would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion.	-1.7697127695131556	-1.0791329225570758	-1.0145891720213684	-0.6277515813427043	-0.5478935000063535	-0.4734741371925687	-0.35290015198499697	-0.34048222120786503	-0.3297411853195362	-0.3016761099536986	-0.20463790858568126	-0.06595748061369393	-0.05179361970318044	-0.02910715653611494	0.02280680483173579	0.09940507671175822	0.10411585115335373	0.2569869752990368	0.3594644624338431	0.42967524494129045	0.45847329872701303	0.46526027609828885	0.5494367534953568	0.9751380303812665	1.6798146829915184	
This is probably Karisma at her best, apart from Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives out his best, without even trying. The story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture. What really made me like it were the performances of the leads, the dialog delivery, as well as the story, for what it was. It could've been directed better, and edited. The supporting case was even great, including Karima's mother in law, even though she just had one shining moment, it was great to watch her.<br /><br />The sets were also pretty good. I didn't really like their portrayal of a Canadian family, but once they step in India, it's as real as it gets.<br /><br />Overall, I would give it a thumbs up!	-4.046205789892925	-1.4712855471019493	-1.4653667959374193	-1.2769667602127197	-0.857727493090437	-0.5349644882482074	-0.40468263661694465	-0.2440299014676257	-0.138527864882921	0.11907953885965664	0.20349979220726494	0.3027842686852839	0.6604899374505091	0.7703104801876167	0.7904743836025439	0.8389857755329082	1.0687804018287623	1.0838836219503434	1.2681902062214643	1.3271064751554627	1.4382035974039786	1.7023408450804498	1.7827968317357135	2.220410646976946	3.508481291693929	
`Bruce Almighty' will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass `Titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would possess the powers of God. That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carrey's new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty'. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the `Gift of God'(his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do God's job any better. Obviously, Bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not `mis.pittiful' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty' is not the most in-depth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `Carreyism'! **** Good	-2.658729325494144	-2.1147271717597205	-1.5404151670291641	-1.4780448647409508	-0.9024891502353812	-0.7193260128199674	-0.5582986283503417	-0.4301354294178477	-0.34712724049559496	-0.2557241060908717	-0.09995379968159436	-0.08811909342706796	-0.023018669305508	-0.01410337447326566	-0.010770028228239081	0.32574952261693446	0.34667448238099763	0.4435265962404248	0.9735882333779509	1.0591583435630532	1.0763299788030838	1.0768172806261442	2.049466241560239	2.2808473720084597	3.8960912524538607	
The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director John Woo. The film stars Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and features Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien in significant supporting roles. Many people believe, or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising, that this is a Jackie Chan film. This is not a Jackie Chan film, Dorian Tan is the star but Jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances.<br /><br />The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named Yunfei (Tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo). Along his journey Yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (Chang Chung) known as "the wanderer." Both men have suffered at the hands of Shih and want to take revenge. The three team up to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety.<br /><br />The martial arts action is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the "Northern eighteen styles kicks" along with some "Southern five styles boxing." Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well. James Tien is not the greatest martial artist on the Jade screen but does an acceptable job. Some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring Chan, Tan and Hung are very good.<br /><br />Director John Woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film, which is refreshing. The cinematography by Leung Wing Kat is very stylish, unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. Joseph Koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's "Shaft" style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual kung fu comedy. Hand of Death is a serious, straightforward revenge driven story.<br /><br />Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and Chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen.<br /><br />Hand of Death is a solid, stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary John Woo.<br /><br />Kung Fu Genre Rating 7.5/10 <br /><br />Wanderer to Tan (referring to his new weapon): "The Little Eagle Wing God Lance." <br /><br />Tan: "Just a knickknack."	-5.537052253728808	-3.351721537904517	-3.3488521384080787	-3.0807446140405905	-1.3771350925040107	-1.1001894167580608	-0.6616417117820097	0.03740106104896157	0.3553864633042624	0.4744579705411921	0.6654490650650531	0.6881903520843834	0.7704967367103173	0.962349704387301	1.37156561182594	1.4050414652091439	1.4323100867549554	1.940273246818573	2.167800121883174	2.3306232658408783	2.404998993422424	2.951534751603313	4.192781073247286	6.777019996255741	7.9871455903315285	
Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? Not one moment of it is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos! Tea Leoni...I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line. I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....Laura Dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "have you ever heard of something called facial expression? Fellings, emotions..."..he's got to work harder on that! Sam Neil, no big deal. The soundtrack...got to change that record, or you get tired of it. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor who I've never seen playing a bad role....unfortunately he can't save the movie, nor can the well computer-created dinosaurs.	-3.6327335996286783	-1.90458223982763	-1.5385452679332698	-1.4139044278175876	-1.0857978410135118	-0.7047596418902254	-0.5555620770845515	-0.45608128065172787	-0.21330384261968027	-0.19418067096762254	-0.1051157132039243	-0.07185278221306589	-0.03717572355876876	0.13611327863129785	0.22916408710941807	0.33325106721223663	0.34289431992205455	0.3602983625329838	0.39134780968235133	0.4800918663691798	0.5133505433834314	0.5647486677275142	0.6318416969923997	1.902143426504947	3.88404140426148	
This is a beautiful, rich, and very well-executed film with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a (male) heir to carry on his craft, but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male-dominated world. The characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society's traditional notions.<br /><br />The story is fun, emotional, and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives, and emotions, is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all. The film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation. There is also humour, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points. The film also examines the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating further interest and depth to the film.<br /><br />The directing, acting, and scenery are all outstanding. Added to the other strengths, this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling, real characters. As a result, the film evokes strong empathy for, and feelings about, the characters.<br /><br />Some have claimed that the ending weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small.	-4.942337088839574	-3.8464561422912396	-2.3179476919293363	-2.296102801059707	-2.1359343898993868	-0.6802847728035091	-0.2705351149423633	-0.25899847772209317	-0.1416217715858552	0.45811013347241053	0.6735982321498736	0.7600219148939571	0.787610756710546	0.8142441145372921	0.9527482480046641	0.9930693746014326	1.3653910652606098	1.6829817538894394	2.3055714803985543	2.3149162629728917	2.344793687155401	2.6631704005270627	4.302275265254067	4.93481759444407	5.389893918765474	
I watch many movies, but presently my genre number one is Asian horror. I have just bought this DVD and I initially found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an intriguing but confused film, since I had not understood many parts of the story. But I saw in IMDb Board a message titled "Explanation of a Masterpiece (all your questions answered) Faster load", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story. I would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in IMDb to help and guide other viewers.<br /><br />In the end, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean film, but I do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, like this film demands, and without the great support of opiemar, I would not be able to understand the story as a whole. I intend to see this movie again in a near future. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")	-2.8133203028174356	-1.7014831390415863	-1.3046053580316683	-0.9590119457186876	-0.9433528028809282	-0.8593836060881609	-0.5839307313641348	-0.2848151548053294	-0.2785530737083692	-0.26914573315670126	-0.2518451634657411	-0.2250917945657937	-0.14766849592967854	-0.09218471006336615	0.01957386709315064	0.07399159517555337	0.13003238802459371	0.4134059788724506	0.519604319332476	0.5507426731200687	0.6294146486868499	0.689739063829538	0.8240682362257644	1.9273128033319489	2.9635425434393436

This is a family movie that was broadcast on my local ITV station at 1.00 am a couple of nights ago . This might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but THE REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange film , strange in the way it doesn't want to upset its audience . Come on there's nothing kids like more than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children . It also explains why DOCTOR WHO was such a successful show across the world . In this screenplay you're just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn't happen . I'm not advocating child abuse but to see Howard Spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better . Can you imagine how much worse KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had gone all PC ? I mean if you're making a movie centered around a children's author who hates children shouldn't the story show and not tell ? <br /><br />Much of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean and you do get the feeling he doesn't know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie . As someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and Kelsey Grammar is very wooden . I guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he's famous for but it fails to work here and there's many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting . But at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities	-6.136692330855834	-3.284113589263662	-2.803213670042156	-2.799959806222244	-2.691923072181294	-2.4927577233837477	-1.910803712246595	-0.9398845473663682	-0.9171212223040519	-0.5856047750672552	-0.5276204233791623	-0.4518636869497126	-0.34547791389292193	-0.23904285081447077	0.28115378411785996	0.38137451404718875	0.6366459949160032	0.6737480985201694	0.9388066680425452	1.0263355023405616	1.3265596290925104	1.6629064906754865	2.0741666435545967	4.062710833193844	7.515339725334126	
A lot has already been written about the film itself, so instead of adding to the noise I just want to say a few words on the two female actors.<br /><br />It has to be a daunting prospect for any actress to star, in a sense, versus the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer pulls it off to sensational ends. A film starring Monica Bellucci where I fall in love with the other girl?? That's not supposed to happen.<br /><br />It's been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema. I have never before seen such innate sadness. She would not be out of place breaking Lon Chaney's heart.	-3.0675001222387337	-1.1783814499064573	-0.9946168712964909	-0.7944973787745049	-0.7328071613683004	-0.7327305990817767	-0.697309566857693	-0.39215402170948266	-0.22983255722582763	-0.20378025317947995	-0.16184076524581253	0.0777044254984201	0.11871521313968458	0.1665141386558952	0.19131612715526	0.270594277999297	0.2790701063007936	0.3898811584878457	0.39487631519800154	0.43380303363691053	0.45909383913362495	0.5599056807463476	1.312384910502488	1.3969927712078294	3.49166100668938	
This movie is amazing. You will NEVER laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's...yes it's...A BOOB! This movie gets funnier by the second--like when Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congrats if you buy or rent this. You'll never return it, in my opinion. I didn't, and I haven't found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was forever in love with Kung-Fu action flicks. If you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value, good or even mediocre acting, and good special effects...this is NOT that movie. If you're looking for laughs and timeless wonderment, pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.	-2.5079708717768328	-2.3147894241764213	-2.299151038752339	-1.634966228736708	-1.1833232049571283	-0.8492172512296737	-0.6207388558413358	-0.28234288834476384	-0.2631120579215	-0.24459597013292697	-0.18071934135649867	-0.15511060650268477	0.11293140716774097	0.17555587874440276	0.275226500343171	0.279747779890223	0.4373958238529818	0.7400016300948008	1.0132468671479165	1.1564832245811991	1.224418592088003	1.459669030445477	2.8755971623409033	2.9961041935253516	3.857902489790662	
Here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite, fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy Andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity. This movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip-off of the already bad movie classic KING KONG from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness, but successfully predicted much of Peter Jackson's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name, as far as a "romance" between the giant (here a Yeti) and a gorgeous human female (Antonellina Interlenghi of Umberto Lenzi's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, who is very easy on the eyes).<br /><br />The film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex -- the Yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package, the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness. But as a trade-off you DO get a wacky old scientist, two inquisitive kids, Tony Kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain, a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure (Dog Adventure movies were big in Europe for a while) and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the Yeti, who turns out to be the good guy, glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands, a monster who's size literally changes scale from shot to shot, some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER look tame by comparison, crowd reaction shots a-plenty made up of either Spanish, Italian or Canadian extras depending upon scene (you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed), and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie.<br /><br />It's here that the film won me over: It's enthusiasm just for being made. Frank Kramer is actually the same Gianfranco Parolini who brought the world SARTANA in 1968 and GOD'S GUN the year before this & was a very important director in the Spaghetti Western and action/adventure genre film scene from the 1960's/1970's and by the time of YETI he was probably delighted to get the work. I would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever, or rather the one he took the most chances with, and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families. The movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless. Or rather they are part of the fun, and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked -- WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY PETER JACKSON'S MOVIE SUCKED. <br /><br />He forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid Power Macintosh pod people animators, and with all it's faults + clunkiness, Kramer's YETI is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this, which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages, not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space. I'd rank this up there with KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA and IT! CURSE OF THE GREAT GOLEM as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever. Because the movie looks so "fake" you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked, trampled, tossed about and smashed. Knowing that and armed with a fertile, energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie, Parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie I will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend. This is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid.<br /><br />10/10, it's about ten minutes too long but who cares, you only come around once and I'd rather go out with a smile on my face.	-5.304458370917089	-4.4597715080339695	-4.3113255467880105	-3.997194155092214	-3.027343479328948	-1.964460198499447	-1.6291823226129232	-1.2571172369458545	-0.8678415684452612	-0.7647185184077373	-0.6407192318975408	-0.3662570673909235	-0.3615787401052206	0.04232081650497917	0.06776787283034626	0.07794892477217583	0.09131565827895549	1.6542235301351964	1.757205220603956	2.042311513593593	2.051541843644514	2.4438850947633637	3.2958976199848022	5.960560722241371	8.030249108271628	
I'm so glad I taped this film when it came on BBC last month! It blew my mind, so gut wrenching and real. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous in this, even though his character isn't always that easy to like or identify with. The final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart, those eyes....<br /><br />I'm guessing that he made this film in between the Dr. Who series, and that makes it even more of an achievement for me. I just love Dr. Who and yet I saw absolutely nothing of him in Mr. Tennants portrayal of this man who knows that he has changed and struggles to create some sort of new identity and life.<br /><br />great little intense drama!	-3.104497036631981	-1.8178195702353783	-1.0679725013372676	-1.0315504826431348	-0.8707635788293465	-0.4226562332637381	-0.28339027943118544	-0.1209386867125892	0.06524819853388426	0.14682163868628648	0.2781206928114242	0.39952305260721643	0.5689964575091756	0.6249812212747846	0.7344517518729807	0.7505084910057876	0.7690206733409262	0.8813969227562246	0.9168531907448323	0.9264563034594006	0.9381322794744171	1.3000849762832165	1.4366168951257126	1.6118087209032734	2.8239958313924953	
Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Dull, bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance. Baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing. Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with. Maybe I'm expecting too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas but I sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting JJ with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie.	-2.9173247302794083	-1.8984350204253435	-1.6392009285869522	-1.415552442473752	-1.3138949940955897	-1.2177959036806076	-0.9757290329279662	-0.4435894706253901	-0.25924624079300057	-0.1048970500485305	-0.0645984843274887	0.03596114095637544	0.09060365715361769	0.10943164811132672	0.12301710309979919	0.36131699265507444	0.38774423716793077	0.40327866931974526	0.44009816080940495	0.8095401824732348	0.9693568243834666	0.9781669080487572	1.3787839586362662	2.469369349409199	4.27597811167076	
While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy. A few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I TOLD you she was possessed!" "Are you telling me the Devil is in my daughter?!"<br /><br />There are many, many more, but you must discover these for yourself - if you dare.<br /><br />The story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even the Priest). And I haven't even gotten to the bad acting. Most notable in this area is the fellow playing Isabelle's father. The director must have just told him to act like he's got a stick up his @$$ because that's the general impression one gets.<br /><br />I don't really want to steer anyone away from BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there is entertainment value to be had...for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary...well, run don't walk.	-3.4105449069498	-2.210286056526853	-1.917865772082177	-1.8599495544905835	-1.5096669484497818	-1.2804616931531883	-1.0943525697825538	-0.4743105723142861	-0.27912284800635356	-0.23191630345791436	-0.18343869501942323	0.04439918948738096	0.1554596339276185	0.23311850779877213	0.2630985139671865	0.26954304254058054	0.46757109120133017	0.5251818866763585	0.5322884265244346	0.659961855177977	0.8944396580681196	1.055720513843591	1.1516087001863058	2.429321582747412	4.429894160815319	
Where's Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-1st season flick (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever, delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research. Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. Makes Logan's Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can't imagine watching it without the commentary of Crow and Servo since it's unwatchable even with it. Clearly what's needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care. With its "rights to pollute and drive" theme, by the end, I'm half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his "cold dead hands" speech. Lee, I could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but 1981?	-4.601028341692312	-2.1438457989453394	-2.0009435244789757	-1.9215848891044918	-1.8278273577591082	-1.3694228620060047	-0.5509002555402152	-0.5240461525829606	-0.503522606319484	-0.4195503032851983	-0.34405136919912194	-0.31376681759115477	-0.2593503428462746	-0.06240903238874136	0.007405413537412059	0.2130590202257138	0.23924705703064042	0.4632274932494102	0.6906324415763893	0.7459704259430653	0.9158996367835861	0.9646555686973128	1.552318345728144	2.4819673965020463	4.881656346881488	
I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and acting is bad. There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way, like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard. The show can't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably. I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of Muslim community to some extent.<br /><br />Till now second season is worse than the first one. I had my hopes high regarding this show, but I was kind of disappointed. Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers. Anyway I wish best of luck for the future.	-4.449615996772332	-2.5625544840821677	-2.439724425260035	-2.328646558550552	-2.2433995705815506	-1.8577119849576562	-1.392959089941554	-0.572406052835759	-0.5208963074120353	-0.32342390932701304	-0.03799684272216709	-0.025116225618915466	0.05844324475543178	0.1439581198012972	0.3706935803304651	0.4873549703043732	0.5263653077825591	0.7020693613031136	0.840186318119539	0.8402238418748386	1.0224526101541855	1.1484214334674308	1.2299971664246279	3.1915549435693302	5.658148366971977	
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see. It started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.<br /><br />Norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but I had a good feeling about this one. Even thou I'm not interested in football I wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up. there are loads of cameos from Norwegian celebrities and players. the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them.

This is a slow moving story. No action. No crazy suspense. No abrupt surprises. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you're into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. It's truly fantastic. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.<br /><br />In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still it did not ruin the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow. The dialog is fascinating. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive. The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.	-4.151820115366211	-4.040280547181346	-3.1115510586303987	-2.6665012249005198	-1.8848932253589594	-0.5495956516947644	-0.46420369708053905	-0.27552825353571164	-0.11794089297241073	-0.07182491776488886	0.19003925043646935	0.6125313612005632	0.6219168598412845	0.6888973583791701	0.7282769411578044	1.1243604411616839	1.1284366661266874	1.3815598020473532	1.6150827722522598	1.643547033170161	2.0989110851235284	2.2136224811875413	4.803031773311065	5.426727181239398	7.210069032567988	
I must admit that at the beginning, I was sort of reticent about watching this movie. I thought it was this stupid, little, romantic film about a French woman who meets in the train an American and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script, since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. Still, I watched it! And I was amazed..."Before Sunrise" is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth, we are sentenced to death, or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, humans, can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales. <br /><br />The ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, in Vienna's station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good manner, so, that, I began to believe that I, myself could live a love-story just like this.	-1.9259176204457438	-1.5177722543858065	-1.2598876368634895	-1.0267601554646641	-0.6117461510808213	-0.5388997790241247	-0.31140289530159143	-0.23473242690132784	-0.23097204234399038	-0.12230893041889426	-0.019014550392715684	0.033062007063110445	0.08530370112795772	0.12434132208392061	0.16213549160260451	0.32334435008450985	0.37932435050772983	0.4225034151291282	0.46307247577021327	0.5552329439751548	0.5623630193811043	0.8642631724228158	1.6146842565739845	1.6245391644720533	2.6400483436919666	
I found Tremors 4:The Legend Begins, to be dull and boring.All the action scenes were stupid.The so called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat, if not smaller.The acting was horrendous, and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga, because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so dumb and useless.Also, if you want to tell a story WAY back in time, make sure you use the SAME ACTOR(Michael Gross), to be someone in the past, when he's someone in the present in the other Tremor movies.Geez...If you haven't seen this film, don't waste your time.Stick to Tremors, 1, 2, and 3, for a good time.This film however, make sure you're remote is sitting right next to you with the STOP button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.	-0.9190698334292356	-0.8088267180335453	-0.7648285405831048	-0.7219826173933157	-0.5829913694806925	-0.5566437748334603	-0.4156808531735575	-0.3310477080951622	-0.26225123460797617	-0.2155922125244231	-0.16290931070980744	-0.14753782706288926	-0.14502531597191276	-0.13038913153791135	-0.12735182073207996	0.07640313824326028	0.15881762666320756	0.21242623170328404	0.30606537045284743	0.33574831624957857	0.3836924819644063	0.4423779821106134	0.5607317725149057	0.7296258977231904	0.9320172364985169

This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces ("The Fall of the House of Usher", "Dance of Death" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, "The Cat and the Canary", "The Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. I won't go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries.<br /><br />Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.<br /><br />Dan Basinger 8/10	-2.3740089947247025	-1.2125710982343314	-0.7130244418002846	-0.675536814651468	-0.5321887499224619	-0.44534770396569234	-0.36225395385911596	-0.30404108441697497	-0.2820434139042966	-0.2778453475017455	-0.25510570474513117	-0.17352239612536732	0.06145108052969688	0.21153913592470852	0.3103944800057543	0.3488084947844351	0.3996567629402541	0.46422009875313014	0.5303402150332495	0.5309402994898094	0.5683195147926785	0.5757019329605454	0.7742561078861707	1.0861879864592054	2.654611046502597	
Have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and wonder-How did they screw it up so bad? This is one of those. The book by Huffaker, "Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian" was great, riotously funny...this movie is not. It seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we CARED about the characters. This movie, which touches on some real concerns about Indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust, or slavery. Not well done.	-2.21453687841572	-1.2105585084312183	-0.8732340981627744	-0.7912743597099983	-0.7333246084812983	-0.5739155133319549	-0.4683924813880218	-0.44027159003679306	-0.40775611930967604	-0.21654775616769015	-0.15808049268888053	-0.05907760534260019	-0.026603669101945997	0.026841306733034323	0.03980465029662695	0.05457684094938039	0.13238443199754046	0.3060802863816714	0.31823826161029845	0.3929796959859238	0.4735328798986255	0.7022702582610183	0.7701136694210079	1.1049369043883304	2.161735342701364	
Being a giant monster fan, me seeing "Yeti" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy pretty easily, and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually, dare I say, decent.<br /><br />Decent for what it is, actually, namely a cheesy giant-monster flick. It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters. They consist of some sleazy ones, some good ones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci-fi film, by far.<br /><br />Yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, he's not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing. Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening, he doesn't even rampage (actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out. Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely (my copy was dubbed in English) and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are.<br /><br />However, we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing, and he's pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical low-budget fashion, he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch of the "fake legs" shots of him just standing there.<br /><br />Yes, the special effects aren't the greatest, but there are definitely some good ones here. A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another, he uses the windows of a building as "ladder steps" to climb down from the top of it - shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in one sequence that really looks much, much better than it should in such a "bad" movie.<br /><br />"Yeti" never stoops as low as say, "A.P.E." does. Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti's nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an "oh yeah baby" manner. But even this isn't that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer.<br /><br />The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it doesn't get boring - the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.<br /><br />"Yeti" may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong '76 rip-offs like "A.P.E." and "Queen Kong" by very far.	-4.087693966478786	-4.001918564572423	-3.1283182938847784	-2.7498305654396384	-1.693998992330287	-1.6743156902458973	-1.2289439523991166	-0.9788858629707187	-0.756596407726208	-0.42117427669140917	-0.28331369291113717	-0.28171639725810466	-0.1651662768976902	-0.12336229010847258	-0.10972369493045603	-0.007052023471484814	0.009296678351868218	1.3965526907625403	1.5408102193910698	1.567488174595474	1.7749581100729515	3.3120276289032966	3.6534562288051657	4.885226759446266	6.659680146901294	
A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.<br /><br />This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt, who made "Wrong Turn" (a film I have not seen). With only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting Schmidt to be a "Master of Horror" in only the most liberal sense. My apologies to him for my underestimation. As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.<br /><br />The issue of the "right to die" is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device. However, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves. Once the horror elements show up, the film goes from "decent" to "spectacular". Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. I was a little creeped out at times (which is good) and most of all: the gore is in extreme abundance! I read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of "Hellraiser" in this. Through the first part of the show, I had no idea what they were talking about. Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of "Hellraiser 2". However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than "Hellraiser 2".<br /><br />Some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look. I didn't watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had (not that it's confusing). The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him. He's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will. I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he's completely unlovable.<br /><br />While the Stuart Gordon episode may be better and I'm excited about the "Washingtonians" episode, I think I could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. When legends like John Carpenter let me down (again) I get a bit worried about the genre's future, but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope. This one is a keeper, and please bring Schmidt back for season 3!	-4.427891893100258	-3.5157722827312545	-3.2279410643275557	-3.1924418351484656	-3.020158163695426	-1.802030522975343	-0.8960652575444964	-0.42326648559453184	-0.4174656063736645	-0.23160520806491108	-0.17519739497931147	-0.09665620226571728	-0.06487398116362297	0.05675524481013139	0.3812693012676746	0.3838303912805092	0.6573763596229233	0.698193448562364	1.4342197913508574	2.376705153828705	3.020340801232315	4.208400475203947	4.518007257818127	5.444366310288711	8.596341676890638	
this is awesome!!! there is no partnership quite like Errol, and Olivia. there love is genuine! I'm 24, yet this flick is as captivating now as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an under-rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so broad, yet so intimate. the last scene between colonel custer (Flynn), and his wife (de havilland), almost brought me to tears (Not easy for a 24yr old guy!!), its so heart-wrenching. there is also a deep Christian message implicit here, the faith Custer has in taking your glory with you, and the trust, and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go, in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre. there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this. a must-see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in American, and military history, from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. i knew Errol Flynn was a star, and De havilland was a screen legend-this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest!	-2.3419817044965336	-2.198900863059242	-1.9254472783112855	-1.7407784391448875	-0.5823705378021811	-0.5012012497620283	-0.47731045037029707	-0.4510356650383364	-0.4036688212138917	-0.07619489616935496	-0.011929774016686077	0.19945083633272673	0.23595090730758575	0.24903762137099897	0.28399202139121904	0.6595126009329001	0.8573686518695645	1.0560829980268784	1.0888520502868664	1.206456567752276	1.2883188619824728	1.3130375362985927	3.043184888754931	3.2578433980717714	4.321410748889401	
In the mid 1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrates to Australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself branded, and thrown in a torturous prison; there, he is gang-raped. Upon release, Hopper hooks up with aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring), and others. Eventually, vengeance becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "scarcely human" performance certainly fits the disjointed feel of the film. Mr. Gulpilil heads up a strong supporting cast. The personnel involved in "Mad Dog Morgan" make it not only worth a look, but also a huge disappointment. <br /><br />*** Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter	-3.080682629712701	-1.752560898079187	-1.7446640467301024	-1.3682865004551519	-1.2304250405538435	-1.12317129244388	-0.7250000555484472	-0.34181877041427733	-0.20359684631842784	-0.1974980919869283	-0.1567027454885514	-0.1449938949048965	-0.021094795574138264	0.05923453101007943	0.20157610763128198	0.377685847324781	0.38531811645660646	0.4363850790030048	0.47785324779178734	0.48475446326166977	0.685891622208103	0.9386481854473381	1.0394868551176195	2.2508257427939204	3.8928215337497867	
Scott Bartlett's 'OffOn' is nine minutes of pure craziness. It is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema. There's no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology. In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),' and, indeed, Bartlett's opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a close-up human eye  recalls Dave Bowman's journey through the Stargate. The visuals are richly-coloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video, as though we're sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.<br /><br />There appears to be some confusion about the film's release date. IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year. Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening. Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss, either! 'OffOn' captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. I had a thought  and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense. Perhaps this is where Mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.	-3.669603572992913	-2.6830476068787066	-2.227323047178806	-2.007505374678	-1.32177691144769	-1.1986946870525619	-0.959860941566713	-0.48217602758036104	-0.48195025700656235	-0.17218221981624535	-0.13738440988486142	-0.1255320441714238	-0.04900784790065392	0.03167948517107326	0.0435578837548522	0.2425809690076745	0.39750444712843075	0.49085593501379715	0.9408650336125535	0.9977906829586325	1.1912042100358513	1.4104664288626971	2.2322071049747656	3.247593807679454	5.504044626560928	
This movie is a joke. I mean a "ha ha" funny joke. Why? Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh I got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical, inane plot and horrible acting. Wow!<br /><br />Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie's "caretakers" and what is their purpose? Since when does 6 people make up a "nation" of Zombies? And is smeared black eye mascara "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old?<br /><br />And lastly; Why was this movie made at all? Why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought.<br /><br />On the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie: We apologize for this movie in advance" LOL. At least they had the decency to do this much!	-6.1780593908878805	-3.0297078640363475	-2.781738863276911	-2.6128165554401814	-2.450320711444493	-1.566206222187255	-1.3833610187408818	-0.875119172988117	-0.8495471359892419	-0.8262261012823655	-0.4378621626470951	-0.41019274793353977	-0.08971558888160587	-0.004614510247913942	0.05448731232940494	0.1054792335005891	0.22456015105654983	0.341809795605509	0.700998664774896	0.7953336044197694	1.3412940084485103	1.6172476807563718	1.7076415216784413	4.015144957695723	5.647984583820791	
Why do all movies on Lifetime have such anemic titles? "An Unexpected Love" - ooh, how provocative!! "This Much I know" would have been better. The film is nothing special. Real people don't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed. The straight woman who "turns" lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character. If you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion, you might enjoy this. Although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?	-3.7111496096928915	-1.6272975782560408	-1.5910156526174344	-1.5668080551337535	-0.9844591630111743	-0.9129390595486991	-0.6922094501966677	-0.5912312267424503	-0.5584709371748366	-0.5309716064582126	-0.23048131282788117	0.013847254712404368	0.2948326525661431	0.3037546333672474	0.3183226319698341	0.3462581962224633	0.4278674399419001	0.4519152055388445	0.5054252862835599	0.5951371265402496	0.653184639733823	0.8303896032215828	1.4267137394486258	1.6553263564843284	4.046438087101109	
This is an astonishing film: a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot, brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images, almost every scene has echoes of another. This is a story told in light, in colour, in many almost-parallels. Every time I watch it, it fills me with delight.<br /><br />The acting is great too. Romane Bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role to his part in La Haine; but no less excellently: shifty and sympathetic at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah!, Monica Bellucci, well, put simply, she plays (is?) the world's most perfect woman. There's one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile; yet in that instant, says more than hours of Hollywood junk.<br /><br />One cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb, sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, it's the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement, the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story. Yet when the moment comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so deftly, that on reflection it makes you gasp. Only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point. But the confidence is justified. Cinema doesn't come much better than this.	-4.710966522494033	-4.024298612272142	-2.196718777997843	-2.008856795077576	-2.005661923673412	-0.7497979782363571	0.15716570900865315	0.22933025892575448	0.2716692086731042	0.6128622529012331	0.63534003570643	0.6701789446716839	0.8753746005790447	0.9070674554975969	0.9098910131190278	0.9198302891752773	0.9807822068484197	1.0260483511260305	1.095567346055643	1.1567977147186477	1.7566529030173803	1.8279301432690132	3.773434520494309	5.643874081478497	6.0377736094998475	
This movie is the best film ever. I can't remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me. with a tear in my eye, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent Dialogues, Music, Acting, Story/Plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindliness and loyalty between a Street performing who famous to The King of Masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar. Little girl liked to be his granddaughter and King of Masks liked a grandson. They were not conventional in real. Every scene they were together was priceless. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. Xu Zhu was Excellent as The King of Masks. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks pretty and played her character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well. If you have't this movie, try it once, Do watch it.	-5.370510628838081	-3.769399830203141	-2.244436031685289	-1.9012818361971207	-1.6266480368170473	-0.3816833608951553	-0.26753458048348533	0.1184271884020259	0.28255568684382876	0.38607138046881345	0.5041992002171553	0.9667338615527766	0.9807636425556252	1.2088542030657934	1.342521759191276	1.5627726177014485	1.5699325048136918	1.5996304281641576	1.7056756595894214	1.827009147489766	2.1881076244937194	2.427650250167316	3.55282326416504	3.5732354316907817	6.0413077188691116	
OK, I just flipped channels and caught DW3. I watched it knowing it would be trash..BUT..as a person who has seen tons of films, this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films I have ever seen...I'm not kidding. It is so bad you have to watch it, like a bad accident you can't turn away from. Sometimes these kinds of films work, IE, Troma movies...but watching Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson slum it up like this is painful....What's even funnier is I pulled up IMDb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4.1/10??? I can't believe it made it past 1.5! Equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series...somehow this garbage warranted part 4 and 5? And to top it all off, some dude's comments on here referenced this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time??? Statements like that scare me about this world!	-4.539850736978986	-2.434060241860385	-2.2280280131266132	-1.8420243267503231	-1.5019569735799643	-1.2891667855712008	-0.952937798346716	-0.7462534078777253	-0.592420711936386	-0.3306636276818942	-0.21238996864638962	-0.11751371537567833	-0.017720468575906957	0.10255755263130592	0.16441976535067584	0.2420598262635284	0.36301404348591915	0.4151825885480168	0.43473596727039837	0.4697335451014425	0.502763540491028	0.5481843064019347	0.8413280815452574	2.823780113939046	4.602748877685588	
This Western was set in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by Western Union. While nice guy Dean Jagger (sporting lots of hair) did his best to get this done, there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons. So, it's up to either Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day.<br /><br />This is certainly one of the better 1940s Westerns I have seen and it nearly garnered an 8--it was that good. However, for the life of me, I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to direct this film--after all, he knew nothing about Westerns. His forte was drama--and I guess this movie is a drama of sorts--just set in the old West. Strange, yes, but it seemed to work out okay, though I wonder how this great German director felt about being given this job.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, it's exceptional--with vivid color, great location shooting and very good acting. As usual, Randolph Scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance. I was surprised, though, with Robert Young being also cast in the film, but it was a good casting decision--he was supposed to be a Harvard-educated Easterner. When I saw Barton MacLane was also in the film, I pretty much assumed he'd be the "baddie" and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career out of playing jerks! As for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was a lot better than I'd hoped--making this movie ending on a very high note.	-2.635919607557606	-2.5004098611221592	-1.8598243999347408	-1.6678796461649048	-0.6500193427098042	-0.46818641940433847	-0.4092223212045647	-0.37935392605635104	-0.17872478925816365	-0.08859075227077334	-0.08198096588826935	-0.04819489135823439	-0.02034390903351254	0.1306352513565481	0.15242250579850705	0.191345369477753	0.4083199058176904	0.4591748885556268	0.7187884394251691	1.1745309189387323	1.2891521564312611	1.8670923073758623	2.238205022886121	3.110774814192966	3.6637575723894416	
Spoilers <br /><br />Well, the one line summary says it all. Melville´s "Le samurai" is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better - much better!<br /><br />In the "Samurai" Alain Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs (with so much suspense in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it.<br /><br />Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog. But I guess Jarmusch liked "Leon" very much or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. So he added this, too. And let me guess: the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")?<br /><br />So what was Jarmusch thinking after all? Where is the unique, the original thought in this movie?<br /><br />I can´t see the point in making carbon (celluloid) copies.<br /><br />A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor	-5.009483328259914	-2.865601799345066	-2.090827657389842	-2.0546111511738125	-1.776002753507124	-1.5495346390768276	-1.3205432601002722	-0.7703580499628644	-0.6360433118580886	-0.4584097155879916	-0.37387467851667894	0.03685717947906364	0.10732474737436967	0.17605364282954303	0.4881866510277753	0.5346291934754357	0.5744381318862881	0.5902379555549937	0.6646287480333709	0.9914944454664618	1.1521321572876158	1.2582198908796072	1.38513788825311	3.3149325932786993	6.1118480083271916	
'A Tale of Two Sisters', or 'Janghwa, Hongryeon', is a true masterpiece. Brilliant psychological thriller, heart-wrenching drama, and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully orchestrated package. From the intricate plot, to the beautiful cinematography, to the absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary.<br /><br />For fear of revealing too much concerning the plot, I will just say it is very satisfying. While it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first, it does a good job of explaining things in the end. And whether you prefer psychological thriller, drama, or horror, I promise you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, its nearly flawless. The set, the cinematography, lighting, and especially the soundtrack, all are captivating. The waltz seemed an odd choice at first, but proved to be an ingenious choice.<br /><br />As for the casting, we're talking absolute perfection. I'm Su-jeong is totally convincing as the defiant, yet troubled Su-mi. Mun Keun- yeong is equally convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister Su-yeon. These two girls were magical on the screen. I will certainly be looking into their other films. Yeom Jeong-ah is deceitfully cheerful and hauntingly evil as the stepmother. Finally, Kap-su Kim gives an excellent performance as the weary, broken father.<br /><br />I truly love this film. If you have yet to see 'A Tale Of Two Sisters', I strongly recommend locating a copy. It is a real gem, worthy of anyone's collection.<br /><br />(10/10)	-6.828230463316955	-4.734432479417643	-3.132614031981586	-2.436780477950846	-1.8123419028299177	-0.5947598905648158	-0.16831183026873126	-0.036679181494565755	0.3423819009309088	0.6009177374456807	0.9276495333055229	0.9765245278290582	1.1527470882154498	1.2601054554183282	1.2922409613490466	1.4825815128630007	1.5772997598281742	1.7751247355435666	1.848955140485884	2.1443130086044486	2.5769408221884254	3.2004769386267227	4.676193874867364	6.4278588960633005	7.718217884334571	
I just saw the movie in theater. The movie has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be. Thats it. The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even Mumbai Indians too (just now Chennai has made it to semi-final). <br /><br />But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real. But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have that much of time. They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie. Now such too stupid action scenes may work in South as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people. But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work. All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded. At the end even some Chinese people appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. This is height of stupidity. Audience is not paying to watch such stupidity. I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies. They cant make it. The last good action I have seen was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me. Does these people see their movie after completion? Can't they figure out that the slow motion action (which is done using ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? Better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than current era scenes. <br /><br />This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors. Please don't make any more action movies, until you acquire the art of making it realistic.	-9.739554025068907	-6.4554356945918885	-4.775588785119659	-4.675670423273499	-3.8715208814841096	-2.9993994336031764	-2.14742377704995	-0.36073354111594547	-0.35771085348847736	-0.2776430385822849	-0.011815238232069508	0.15073465679526415	0.3713973840271062	0.491680623488867	0.5314344765304996	0.5623565197906888	0.9369434667054325	1.318890858067019	1.5624156947389365	2.1715391700755107	2.280326923420781	3.390074592271181	3.7732760033600012	5.964090545388328	12.988255643846294	
he was my hero for all time until he went along with {if you can call it a movie} I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was.............I can't believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors. I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.<br /><br />The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals, and had read this story as a novel, you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.<br /><br />Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all.<br /><br />I hate to repeat other peoples comments, but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic. The condition of those scenes chopped in, is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.<br /><br />My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie, it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget (Segal being paid 5 of that) and that the movie still came in under budget. I must concur.<br /><br />It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie, as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie .	-7.970638766004878	-4.643528393500969	-4.404159888774585	-4.257634271017722	-3.6290102989054898	-1.7318716844513011	-1.393395856684167	-1.0116429638120936	-0.8868085126566277	-0.8530017457115191	-0.7757085589583879	-0.7185510740707336	-0.6924417664428824	0.08226673024315193	0.2228174252920076	0.23444454035367207	0.2863781802470242	0.4565287494457489	1.105666645333787	1.334405534382125	1.470075455595225	1.8035218359959435	2.7816548106055907	4.467773057284877	8.264998822748105	
It plays like your usual teenage-audience T&A movie, but the sentiment is incredibly bleak. If it was made today, it'd be considered an art house movie. It goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid, but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The whole teen flick formula is adhered to, but nothing turns out the way you'd expect. Imagine a director's cut of 'It's a Wonderful Life' where, at the end, James Stewart wasn't allowed to return to the real world. An incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre. It makes you feel dirty afterwards: there is no redemption for the characters. I'm amazed it ever got made. The eighties version of Detective Story.	-3.1724191151324437	-2.094622450510702	-1.572339406838176	-1.5290304212581425	-1.5027099548899256	-1.0605821222701302	-1.0147017642545146	-0.6692587561651028	-0.5956949806261316	-0.5673846955607312	-0.4090014554545878	-0.38946187124376463	-0.30943799687359336	-0.2671351063467161	-0.18900541806572155	0.1372120565044928	0.18401298980996203	0.3617841084660316	0.45369267610392205	0.748575514136427	0.7588170596231467	1.5142390174852225	1.8602749511722876	2.489822630980303	4.203155475331884	
Horrible acting, Bad story line, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes in I decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen... It didn't. (Aside from a nice breast shot) The movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the sets. You even see this same red chair in several different "locations" If you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment, not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog.. (Note to producers) Renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable) If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you got it with a return guarantee... You will be demanding your money back... I only spent $2.99 to rent this tonight and I feel ripped off.	-4.437152005796471	-2.681570969843578	-2.570200719943924	-2.3945296644962384	-2.1277253261054385	-2.0436669841712805	-1.079040152996374	-0.9370407653921364	-0.7048895648687958	-0.6115030615475077	-0.4705882512572244	-0.23466458405538648	-0.22572541650846759	-0.10108535368921774	-0.009328762990121198	0.15261057206705186	0.275785975122844	0.5795654287392229	0.6027814563463507	0.8969306767168963	0.9532605097888518	1.4292439544119921	1.8090845154274307	2.6525200518717518	4.0018360712498895	
As with FOOTPRINTS (1975), I became aware of this one purely by accident: it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I researched when that film turned up on late-night Italian TV, as being in a similar vein; incidentally, I missed out on that screening of THE LIBERTINE (though I acquired it via the same channel later on) but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the English-dubbed R1 DVD during my sojourn in Hollywood in late 2005/early 2006. Actually, in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it, I was let down by THE LIBERTINE – being too light-hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)!; to be honest, for much of the time, I was afraid that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN would go the exact same route…but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked (if not exactly unpredictable) final twist.<br /><br />The film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era: an eminent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a female journalist (Dagmar Lassander) at his fashionable home for the week-end; however, it transpires that he’s a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate (or even kill) them! Therefore, for the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at Leroy’s hands (including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image!)…until the tables are subtly, but unsurprisingly, turned: she not only emancipates herself from his control, but teaches him that Man and Woman can co-exist harmoniously – except that Lassander’s following her own personal agenda as well!! <br /><br />The leads are perfectly cast, and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood; furthermore, it’s greatly abetted by a typically effervescent “Euro-Cult” score (from the ever-reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginative – even outré – look (the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form, with a steel-trap where its sexual organ should be, seems to emanate from Freud: incidentally, this prop figured prominently in stills I’d seen previously from THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN…but it barely registers in the film proper!). Other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program “Sexual Aberrations And The Stars”, and an idyll at a castle belonging to Leroy’s family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant. One of the highlights, then, is easily Lassander’s erotic dance virtually in the nude – an episode which actually spearheads the ‘humanization’ of Leroy; eventually, the two characters have a ‘showdown’ in the latter’s pool – amusingly set to a Spaghetti Western-type theme! <br /><br />In the long run, for all its stylishness, the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it’s worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the U.S. by film-maker Radley Metzger’s company Audubon Films; he would even employ its production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To get to the edition I watched: apart from the usual shortcomings in the English-dubbing department, the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed-out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack! By the way, there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film’s running-time: its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes – all I can say, however, is that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes!	-8.067214175243983	-4.067631218358698	-3.8108069412741035	-3.7779397133122936	-3.5797562660181366	-1.697572139291748	-1.6942405588793388	-1.310498957035891	-1.11894186050548	-1.0251973402875172	-1.019055373037733	-0.7440938429182201	-0.6094786625672324	-0.11563974938436308	-0.022773489628339277	0.546481889900176	0.8758110968610012	1.00358513511647	1.2775389383514293	1.282798618318092	1.6016371392915594	2.3735987585697016	2.6047297300120564	4.632015145629418	8.38779305344413	
Although Bullet In The Brain is, without question, superior amongst short films, it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film. And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot. But after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place. There is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like there's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit. Despite these complaints, there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short, and even full length films. The makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and Hollywood action.	-4.119171222016952	-1.7498927555338673	-1.7378121780213445	-1.6401830730698752	-1.5975167128499619	-1.5581440616806321	-1.4343373399758637	-0.3358876089195971	-0.29432073090475314	-0.2719552480768062	-0.10777654297651118	-0.06499799527939283	0.0819496642515564	0.20311604195911898	0.2493646313257052	0.3259801239613442	0.3615370478391779	0.46842085376654974	0.47277612039809896	0.5502011598277063	0.5802273576164875	0.695524019280641	2.124195120208267	2.3512899480370963	4.7926393723567715	
pokemon the movie was a terrible film. unlike the first one, this is not a good film at all. the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it. in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent. the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad. tracey really doesn't have much to say or do, and unlike brock offers no comic relief. the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash, and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining. overall this film isn't worth renting and the short movie before didn't do anything for me or my wife. and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well, maybe the next one will be better.cant ge t much worse	-4.806227562797834	-2.500354897349638	-2.4564154603978348	-2.4348017911454596	-2.1852014581424757	-1.5984487254246442	-1.1358622628888084	-0.5751130460072367	-0.5456130010916501	-0.4934276151340391	-0.4569600645271335	-0.44629939061508705	-0.2290700803822155	-0.14212781390488904	0.10252956284182665	0.2884939740855439	0.34870773743422356	0.4658490003801383	0.594635027686425	0.7801291660822653	1.0165704736102952	1.2195312317778089	1.6618699724149941	3.0122608466555842	5.578472381791519	
I, too, found "Oppenheimer" to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on American PBS. David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller, as I recall, and the overall conception was spectacularly good. The only reason that the series doesn't rate a full 10/10 is for the low-budget production values in some areas. Actual content is absolutely first-rate in my recollection.<br /><br />The Oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the UK on July 31st! It will be a Region 2/PAL set, but it would seem that a Region 1/NTSC set should be soon in the offing.<br /><br />If you have a universal player in the US, you can order the series right now from Amazon UK.<br /><br />http://tinyurl.com/znyyq<br /><br />Huzzah!!	-1.747336668677093	-1.380045947925816	-1.1716912234295116	-0.557641015027248	-0.47324138882146743	-0.4410146669159062	-0.4287548547965872	-0.4142319755013327	-0.3177805530544209	-0.04231893714099555	-0.023528708615717316	0.098550360686034	0.34832337515833556	0.3519461178782416	0.49001854839236997	0.4906937665541208	0.5163962945350276	0.6475406598912732	0.754010440423873	0.8599275392537812	0.8667274904986497	0.9321983843901552	1.760781845266849	1.7745440739060165	2.532683947798863	
I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspect. So I'm not expecting much. But it should at least have a story. Stories don't cost a thing except time.....apparently, they didn't have any time either.<br /><br />"Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers. The picture of the zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in the movie. It was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre.<br /><br />The running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room), it sounded like zombie porn....which if you think about, sounds kinda gross.....but it wasn't even that good.<br /><br />The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.<br /><br />It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off. I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb won't allow me to use decimals.	-6.812975601869405	-3.125940308853009	-2.6666207788364193	-2.601722877248336	-2.195775308051102	-1.943968879204645	-1.7285936488421767	-0.6115879628715895	-0.5866501468636561	-0.5159353074501304	-0.2928422605071108	-0.12255420010662936	-0.05959405901069367	0.35676898194579965	0.38770308578577084	0.4462314994775664	0.5291119263576811	0.5586615854206636	0.5930831052532217	0.7425173120980371	0.8373400721785955	0.9845048624640167	2.510446115846579	3.5871044683899838	7.171382080726559	
Jameson Parker And Marilyn Hassett are the screen's most unbelievable couple since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly think it's the former and his self-centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. Normally, I don't like to let myself get so ascerbic, but The Bell Jar is one of my all-time favorite books, and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy.	-2.156506205170877	-0.8026618969707335	-0.679184586091069	-0.6448823110249621	-0.554953420057392	-0.5363397068976661	-0.5180593987088298	-0.49632508854672486	-0.1709179010323123	-0.16836302279290088	-0.09819720658555184	-0.07765190122672447	-0.04809531660856123	-0.018820457307074684	0.022475081020635432	0.07046150025156206	0.1073874399251167	0.11920266677982166	0.1330105337038047	0.24541423105162335	0.27096061906884295	0.30903845474463915	0.6892860248713248	1.165542251901158	2.1475124125399176	
If Western Union isn't exactly the real story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project.<br /><br />Dean Jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he's thrown from a horse and sustains some fractured ribs. An outlaw on the run, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings Jagger to help. Later on he's hired by Western Union and works for Jagger.<br /><br />Jagger also hires a young easterner played by Robert Young who's an engineer. Young is doing one of his few loan out films away from MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals for Jagger's sister Virginia Gilmore.<br /><br />Western Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy any western fans. The telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws, Indians, and your garden variety labor troubles.<br /><br />Slim Summerville as the timid cook and Victor Killian as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes. They both provide some good comic relief. <br /><br />Fritz Lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along. Western Union is solid western entertainment.	-3.3705787321314364	-2.278381373426561	-1.6579477979712542	-1.2378721505859658	-0.715740189066418	-0.42420994347566354	-0.18787499513550504	0.0966447381159886	0.21405930763933717	0.23881051522617963	0.26453602159591805	0.39962542335216916	0.44711038373528045	0.45605916085776177	0.5183508872180629	0.737726524656733	0.7702765424043693	0.84740620047396	0.8679948778590889	0.8734295602449862	0.8986525889977823	1.5686946681111562	1.7186355751961804	2.696674229907175	3.4320966537991393	
In this TV special Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer. Not content with this forever, Jon takes Garfield to a self help group in order to meet people. How many people will be interested in a loner 20-something who's best friend is a cat?<br /><br />After several failed attempts at getting a girl, including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals David Brents' fusion of Flashdance and MC Hammer in The Office (Disco's dead?, says Jon), he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself. <br /><br />Naturally, they get on but Garfield is worried that John will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat. Fortunately Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. <br /><br />With slicker animation than past TV specials, this feels like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends.	-4.52975531131565	-2.0839317818891674	-1.7106191386065426	-1.5884606270185666	-1.5494872417586818	-1.2476269392233315	-0.925229736738881	-0.5850302953690817	-0.3792939360111568	-0.30633573274589376	-0.27258491539508245	-0.10356107510973181	0.07761828062737391	0.09076501750205404	0.16173645346047166	0.17977230697804714	0.20863061895761553	0.23621911062633283	0.3517619681037565	0.5733359744161157	0.6265998784065712	0.9267135512998975	1.5333641047070237	1.7354748420523107	4.109666377866271	
For late-80s cheese, this really isn't so bad. There are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one-liners ("That was grand theft!" - "Thanks!") and Madonna gives a fine performance; nothing award-worthy here, but that goes for Razzies as well as Oscars. I'm curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular (pre-British influenced) speaking voice rather than the hyper-Bronxy accent used instead. Oh well. As a side note, I got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work; he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck the UPS delivery guy died about a year after Who's That Girl	-2.2205749517834956	-1.0694593900307603	-1.0667564317775893	-0.7961409213263283	-0.6762715186070221	-0.6217182550341753	-0.5665248709354371	-0.4062395116298719	-0.3756707510042863	-0.22109347708584115	-0.2190179113559405	-0.16027822551906848	0.07042953656957956	0.09260135467574028	0.12478424270694463	0.2116043161572147	0.2783093683237474	0.299714105466716	0.6390506438503593	0.6727509014668108	0.8377644339558835	1.0142082016619491	1.0797868656758556	1.541897185805027	2.0521479266891856	
This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives.<br /><br />I thought "The Walker" would be thrilling and engaging, but I was so wrong. The pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow, that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes. That's how slow it is.<br /><br />The fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom. It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. Maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? <br /><br />It's sad that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing.	-5.62097852930557	-2.705000904332541	-2.6997100521937805	-2.654042948251224	-2.295339783027635	-1.924593648312134	-1.8057331522702822	-0.5823849734970344	-0.556469987029308	-0.18926465680143653	-0.14264519399773254	-0.11172720559899474	-0.09080351014449291	0.10061981053191218	0.18725248648828716	0.2208725165357606	0.32187610055086346	0.43939380503919484	0.5821024134700986	0.820867452800729	0.8808471477798774	1.045595964327694	2.978090704769667	3.090056512813377	6.040057718835675	
When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore sub-par production values, and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare. This movies simply has no good scares to offer. It can't even be enjoyed as camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, the kills were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera work was wretched, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who were obviously trying, but who had to deal with terrible, contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they got any rehearsal, either. It's embarrassing to watch, and so boring than making it through to the contrived "surprise" ending requires tremendous endurance. It's quite easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you must watch this movie, don't miss the "Making of"-featurette. The writer/director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold, daring move. (Seen it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it's a new-age "Citizen Kane." It's like listening to a group of third-graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant. They truly think they've created something of substance. It's sad, really The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for true atrocities, like "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny." So "American Nightmare" isn't the WORST movie I've ever seen, but I'd have to say that it's somewhere in the bottom fifty.	-8.410771686220874	-5.436561771415368	-4.819002109060012	-4.767079483522526	-3.9232218081189436	-3.0931017609134406	-1.990504969601159	-1.8296166889244312	-1.4663728512251537	-0.617474442852598	-0.36345259217883724	-0.16723777480229762	0.2571351795975964	0.3444844666562568	0.3792632196537671	0.959173762240445	0.9930387945710086	1.2564684904625902	1.428040299620541	1.5452802428674606	1.5915133380160777	2.232276631356798	2.323269717994023	6.300273362867239	10.007192818627418	
I would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of Season 10! <br /><br />The final episode of the 10th season "Unending", where (it would certainly appear that) the Asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief! <br /><br />From the extremely rushed end of the series, it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season. My guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-DVD moves!<br /><br />Unless the Asgard return in a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), I think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends!<br /><br />Poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.	-2.5126465067661705	-1.731984638513153	-1.7264644956482769	-1.6615603518739284	-1.5379103591065528	-0.792638180592026	-0.6174075272295039	-0.35248213036492193	-0.2818441341348729	-0.1491906709077431	-0.11987313377656551	0.015127696757691406	0.11214875102517399	0.24920981119201147	0.2994222082382156	0.41321258848327014	0.4652274215026944	0.48590809095411824	0.4976924556171858	0.5548470135733714	0.6886317185439697	0.8253558910070149	1.021639062766299	2.50131940359463	3.723123250514229	
I remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. Several years later I see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie. The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself. The cast just makes it that much more appealing. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture. She nails Mrs. Chamberlain's mannerisms, the accent, and even look. She shows the pain, hurt, surprise, and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it's hard to remember that it ISN'T Lindy. In my opinion, this performance of Meryl's was better than her Oscar-winning turn in "Sophie's Choice", and should have garnered her her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason, wasn't recognized by the Academy with at least a nomination. In all, this movie only receive ONE Oscar nod (Streep's for Best Actress.) However, it did receive several Australian Oscars and nominations.<br /><br />Definitely a top-rate movie: it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast.	-3.56058949919749	-3.1463820894472407	-2.214399468549778	-1.789676947210815	-1.7847864219552683	-0.7189965460768026	-0.5452555461347616	-0.05028339466949737	0.17266349813337153	0.2954780937057688	0.31723930805339273	0.40524343365445503	0.5234831706140936	0.644174303507489	0.6470661046836867	0.6550177652374217	0.9460944322522191	1.163163703119586	1.2685187339891635	1.407479214091929	1.448703309991991	1.5733315236806336	3.469094765236009	4.18532370193977	4.336659931561268	
A slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where Max is choosing a ring in a jeweller's shop. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "A Mid-summer Night's Dream" in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. Here Max and Lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. On top of the merry mix-up, Max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. And because Max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another,too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film , I wasn't quite sure if I was in the present or the past.There is much running down corridors, stairways, through doorways, into elevators etc. I accept all that in a fast-paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? After four collisions it ceases to have any impact, if you'll excuse the pun. High marks for art design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but I do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when Max almost exits at the same time. However a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. If you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you'll finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss. It can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love, like Puck in a "Mid-summer Night's Dream".	-2.711247394958871	-1.8296846218392178	-1.7887448918031894	-1.5624465652321207	-1.2126020753064624	-0.7621636247197636	-0.6372351429529154	-0.27650693390570535	-0.2604423835945863	-0.25853994892243587	-0.0654829068692894	0.11248226346412746	0.227137519760497	0.3104867966417066	0.38007204740821177	0.4054059323288609	0.43553955950800216	0.46266733035700225	0.5437247336145945	0.6258098215304977	1.379528782302702	2.3323958673140197	2.363500859082199	2.98581397314738	3.9323175683414044	
Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. <br /><br />The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake. Still, it's business as usual for dead-camper movies.<br /><br />There are much better films in this vein, but over all The Prey may be watchable enough for die-hard slasher fans. Although one might be more rewarded to watch Just Before Dawn (1981), Wrong Turn (2003), or even The Final Terror (1983) again.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****	-3.8236136402130314	-1.8950136130874946	-1.764281257379445	-1.6910068243568477	-1.5002208342197365	-0.8922204715315332	-0.7943942747870592	-0.3788160857368438	-0.3378052429442337	-0.33691314610771284	-0.145301654868845	-0.12131600592494435	-0.09549397207899399	-0.0315111344203613	0.3282977328514993	0.41243287161779585	0.4678643668609958	0.479857298682854	0.5042537704835262	0.5662945350897348	0.794469057427567	0.8469076997750079	0.9306760403634031	1.807855074373067	4.205850312951114	
More wide-eyed, hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti-social, pathological behaviour. Danza and Grayson will leave you begging for mercy.<br /><br />It's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead (or in nursing homes). I kinda thought about suing them for torture. As this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor, defenseless ear-drums, I felt instant, strong pain envelop my entire being. That damn muscular vibrato can shatter Soviet tanks into tiny bits, nevermind glass.<br /><br />"Why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it?", you might ask angrily. Fair point, fair point... The answer is that I wanted to, but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that I fell to the floor, writhing in agony. With my last ounces of energy, I tried to reach the remote but couldn't.<br /><br />A silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven, who then proceeds to "pigmalionize" him. Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson, but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up. This may seem like a rather thin plot, but this noisy movie is so chock-full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all. This movie is RELENTLESS. Forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with Slayer's "Reign In Blood" (as in a South Park episode). Whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world, it's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year-olds impersonating grown-ups. I can only envy people who find movies like this funny. It must be great being easy-to-please: what a world of wonder would open up to me if only I could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious, gut-busting comedy. <br /><br />But let's examine this phenomenon, the 50s musical. My best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day-dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into Utopia or Heaven (depending on whether you're church-going or Lenin's-tomb-going), or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy-inspired places. TTONO is more akin to a representation of Hell, but that's just me. I don't seem to "get" musicals. People talk, there is a story - but then all-of-a-sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened! When you think about it, musicals are stranger than any science-fiction film.<br /><br />Worse yet, TTONO (my favourite type of pizza, btw) is not just a 50s musical, but one with opera squealing. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as over-training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear-piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure. The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet. I tried lowering the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I ended up lowering it to a 1, which is usually so low that it's only heard by specially-trained dogs and certain types of marsupials, and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys!<br /><br />Take the scene in the small boat in the river. Danza starts off with one of his deafening, brain-killing tunes, and then... nothing. No animals anywhere to be seen. Even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have all but left. If you look carefully, you might even see the trees change colour, from green to yellow, in a matter of minutes. No, this was not a continuity error, it was plain old torture of the flora. And those trees were just matte paintings! Imagine how real trees would have reacted.<br /><br />The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency, but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self-explosion. I can listen to the loudest, least friendly death metal band for hours, but give me just a minute of a soprano and I get a splitting headache.	-18.715079589754996	-9.302901193895075	-8.129924332282322	-7.8545610336624065	-7.78193826655854	-4.368466741724404	-4.151154577173023	-3.323587560773505	-2.152219704630731	-1.5136609105840868	-1.3497627794848985	-0.9644711051007049	-0.7376633696494717	0.8511475292419087	0.9230154970864248	1.1597112796101532	1.6295247223383496	2.123993267780811	2.3391260263635623	2.587806933304377	2.6136789546152697	3.2665877136667363	4.9027330070435795	9.458045316600947	19.271628136057096	
Formulaic to the max. Neither title reflects the serial's actual content, "Fighting Nazis in Morocco," (actually, the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. The packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. That's at least three a chapter! Aside from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too. So, kudos to the fight choreographer, who is the real star of this serial! <br /><br />Two positive notes: the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights, and best of all, we have the girl side kick (often a journalist, as she is here) actually participating in the mayhem, mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys. Yet to come is Linda Stirling killing the main villain in "Manhunt of Mystery Island" (1945). On the negative side, there are just too many jump out of the way escapes-- before the slab falls, before the car goes over the cliff, before the speedboat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck hits you, etc. etc.<br /><br />It is claimed that this serial partially 'inspired' George Lucas to make the first Indiana Jones film, but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial's development.<br /><br />Rod Cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, a role he played in all his films. Other than watching all the furniture getting smashed, there's nothing really going on here, compared to other serials that have fewer fights, more story, better actors and more developed characters.<br /><br />I give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing.	-4.682495314692738	-2.7799282436666517	-2.2263692190138373	-2.2223076990796176	-1.7849936901948067	-1.4086459171932395	-1.218113295864786	-0.701305465343917	-0.31976147565291246	-0.15835920663926045	-0.04239656295717784	-0.012876820042190679	0.1516002445799673	0.18535315783255152	0.3874889336592203	0.3965464735478525	0.5296661047412144	0.5587451048033685	0.5782803776635858	0.8589976167854039	1.1394465551313275	1.4108224173464496	1.4329105681549361	3.0820934903492447	6.166905865930201	
The story of a drifter, his sheep ranch boss, and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes, but it's still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this region.<br /><br />This movie was the first time I had ever seen the excellent Mary Regan, and I've been a fan of hers ever since. The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the film "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /><br />Sharply acted, with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads. I first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in America, but believe you me, the unexpurgated version is not to be missed.	-2.5744815900966223	-1.3346450712896238	-1.2586873421623401	-1.2365805893813342	-1.0358223011131629	-0.6168187179812326	-0.3293299523989197	-0.19937685755466816	0.031544032465735984	0.04664412585956429	0.23445813500101295	0.24889602171116737	0.2686788022723474	0.3427796310817099	0.46188301202603077	0.46967639221129875	0.6432278190005443	0.7036355785580867	0.7263426001859197	0.9578430132043725	0.9820469994777797	1.1130339818994424	1.9528982714165104	2.102786832616151	2.495192706422208	
Hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits. For every "Godfather II," there are dozens of "More American Graffiti's," "Stayin' Alives," and "Grease 2's." While the original "Grease" is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960's, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.<br /><br />Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein, and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.<br /><br />Reviewers have complained that, because "Grease 2" is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking. However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates. With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's, and the only nostalgia evoked is for "Our Miss Brooks" and "Sid Caesar's Comedy Hour." The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately, "Grease 2" is not even unintentionally funny. Instead, the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.	-9.425083871311754	-4.656598677201599	-4.565836437270127	-4.4760589586670525	-4.336651923344215	-2.2885273578543455	-2.0192100932301456	-1.276280221905826	-1.1694844749708377	-1.1534363705927662	-0.6699730974917769	-0.6358924088141753	-0.1910021889931353	0.11343083550854136	0.2740021022175558	0.3615419758591849	0.7477610511740402	0.8866949385561571	0.9220663656542654	1.5240364462331315	1.7757555345799545	2.0680072570373733	2.9759314418775835	4.683496334219402	10.259038190656513	
"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster", and, of course, "Plan 9 from Outer Space". This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "The Plan 9 Companion", failed. It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together Ed's life and untimely death for the viewer. Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.	-1.6460211011254242	-1.2610114908880203	-1.1361615426752967	-0.857404202514853	-0.6311488146544562	-0.5684910884628191	-0.2649681081206583	-0.1914421376525261	-0.17350365388738972	-0.1104203493503585	-0.1025704647215469	-0.0337407920631322	-0.014440943411996754	0.0275135746516919	0.05139431350290598	0.16843366574358665	0.1914900174813229	0.19925516320600534	0.3939913710670622	0.7300164404650706	0.8254189126460596	0.8994221241486331	1.030124352214772	1.3712101921892916	1.5724720437185036	
My dad is a fan of Columbo and I had always disliked the show. I always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he goes on watching it none the less. That is his right as an American I guess. But my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that Spielberg had directed the premier episode. It was then that I was thankful that my dad had bought this show that I really can't stand. I went through his DVD collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college. My opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed, but I did gain respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors. And that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along (get the pun, HA,HA. Like Spielberg did. It's like Jesus before he became a man. Or thats at least what I think that would feel like. Any ways if your fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it contains little of Peter Falk. I attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet. This episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of Columbo's investigation, as many later episodes would do.	-5.859200665728702	-3.3524637307809644	-2.3612128428013106	-2.3052988210424856	-1.901759638909928	-1.4719957583926293	-1.1027557055780122	-0.3848142289584424	-0.37899073912216796	-0.09931359749641806	-0.0699136162697622	0.0947627257687047	0.1982226909946567	0.24580590594214657	0.26234049205294707	0.2858627896343572	0.5487513385705409	0.5544358163002636	0.7430068154689581	0.8262325472989653	0.960578252808923	1.3870927704735945	2.8019434848113547	2.8056539553078474	6.7925546195102795	
Let me start out by saying I'm a big Carrey fan. Although I'll admit I haven't seen all of his movies *cough*the magestic*cough*. Bruce Almighty was enjoyable. None of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end, I dont know what the writers were thinking. Somehow I couldn't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re-creating Liar Liar.<br /><br />On a positive note, The Daily Show's Steve Correl is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast. See Bruce Almighty if you're a big Jim Carrey fan, or if you just want to see a light-hearted (que soft piano music) somewhat funny comedy.	-1.5268569934604161	-1.4392759110423792	-1.37799622191536	-0.9132862679174079	-0.8859654611305569	-0.866930518015788	-0.4416158761876255	-0.4056481711207729	-0.3941236876933022	-0.27169655611489046	-0.19838109896220849	-0.13729144396996001	0.02694480697601792	0.13160023319438352	0.16964580868792065	0.28957953633198485	0.290757821409811	0.5469853962167556	0.590144478388322	0.6524941094855159	0.8285137237537149	0.9469995019006257	1.447932965935648	1.7780050111388772	2.557449862553778	
The Stooges are back and funnier than ever. "Brideless Groom" in my opinion was probably the best Shemp flick.<br /><br />Shemp has the opportunity to inherit $500,000(which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today) from his dead uncle. BUT! There is a catch. He has to marry someone that day by 6 o'clock. Shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers, except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his. But he doesn't want her, he wants someone a little more on the Victoria's Secret model type of women. But obviously he has no choice since he's no Collin Ferrel himself. But when it is printed in the papers that he is to inherit all that money if married, his ex girlfriends are on the "I want my man back" attack! <br /><br />What a great stooge flick! This is up there with thewinners of all stooge flicks! <br /><br />9/10	-2.8475265537114574	-2.350787150086229	-2.2722137475900746	-1.9767475144342446	-1.110138028553519	-0.6274420976465027	-0.3935536534676956	-0.39062681147185024	-0.28010203167686265	-0.24707232562309114	-0.14532583262595494	-0.11643273840624059	-0.028107283772889433	0.28767361615277176	0.3068793138031741	0.32504814972209123	0.5506115891667739	0.6885307740949932	0.7500115691194038	0.815966382540441	0.9698181453125339	1.0815048668580987	2.2012731262428953	2.594457746225354	4.135597094060738	
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.<br /><br />We saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. It was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive. If I wasn't on a bus I would have walked out on the movie. Anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned.	-4.3129694977221735	-2.657925206341183	-2.588403607629312	-2.5878523055540645	-2.1608123629385823	-1.200711808095351	-1.0496455974433585	-1.0319527307105862	-0.8033706372411588	-0.6612570992785921	-0.353274187413935	-0.28962666531578907	-0.22879058808152422	-0.1593762180964045	-0.12789074949604093	0.20231539762385384	0.41140287434999956	0.4214387193979901	0.463331838444567	0.911666074854589	1.0920229390646157	1.1445644794467031	1.3301187334533067	2.889102771268544	4.732500172899007

Wow, alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here. Wonderful. My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films. We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America. Now before you ask why am I writing a review? Instead ask why some people bash it. I'm writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films. Why do I love em, it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go. I've seen it all. Almost every horror film known to man, Argento, Fulci, Bava, Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster. I've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films. Why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place. This review is for the Devils Experiment. I find it devoid of story which is fine by me. Why do I watch horror films? So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people. The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that's all it is. Pure unadulterated violence. Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold. Why do people bash it. Cause they like a story, so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story. It make em feel better about themselves. We all want blood and gore. It's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story. The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world. Maybe I shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe I should. My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not. I've always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films. Sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place. The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody. It's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only. If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those. But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you. There is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years. They are wrong, disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom, unless she is totally cool. Good luck, enjoy and never stop living your life.	-12.692284741039789	-6.96921645203327	-5.3683027276445605	-4.236715597610239	-4.224041199647732	-3.966306820270885	-2.3698009323793388	-1.8767361161446043	-1.689503080097169	-1.3183447998607947	-0.3369279187598057	-0.3129845556427233	0.12027709980040194	0.3389016947951726	1.0652280126711235	1.2670111982508216	1.5587521477165218	1.941542842012907	2.0025240940221964	2.4684245831424843	2.4895585158602422	3.1570245904466727	3.7286712233244477	6.574968057019196	13.73277910624519	
OK, this movie, was the worst display I have seen in years. The actors weren't to bad (I figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). Anyways, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message onto people. The last scene was extremely messed up. That is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. What someone believe in is a matter of opinion. This movie just shows how corrupted religion is, especially Christianity.<br /><br />If you want to watch a b-movie, this ain't. If you want to watch a movie that is TRYING to brainwash the masses. Well this is the pick of the litter. go right for it. If you are going to convey a message, do it, don't force it. Ridiculous, that people would abuse the media to such a degree. Especially, Christians.	-6.427918676619281	-3.221075024704191	-2.9430790685266155	-2.543932975233619	-2.2249280003298026	-1.6763953313011757	-1.6325197645744558	-1.013624420094475	-0.6036760525879884	-0.2865748212726452	-0.0841569491156327	-0.04051424184315913	0.2094181897803401	0.21692949509552903	0.25573618058079584	0.5590266664356313	0.575979590821272	0.6094100471657129	1.015655391137618	1.0329533786073495	1.4016804635735003	1.5578478301712648	2.5415471860552685	3.340268452481051	6.883944237094208	
I don't understand how "2 of us" receive such a high rating... I thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense, followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble. However, I did like Jared Harris' performance of John Lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours.	-1.1637404013386734	-0.7380489428068788	-0.73029714060153	-0.6963951975163281	-0.49670595945154666	-0.360566160038265	-0.24084047359424995	-0.17200920616116078	-0.16234446780325623	-0.15946841322253863	-0.15063221241658115	-0.14943868294073204	-0.10915977750415057	-0.05838012651672055	-0.04685531882483737	-0.032792666884141994	-0.02361467063548295	-0.018752882787226144	0.07669302559984463	0.20042754380592598	0.21173592218661128	0.3695866453774569	0.37912125815929676	0.6119774231616677	1.2607373519959806	
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful Hans Keller - I've often wondered if I'm missing the point. The story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. I know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to Whitby by teenage vampires who'll drink my blood while listening to Busted, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. I've always been a werewolf man myself.	-2.9055008709138943	-1.461282279999645	-1.3319076038593114	-1.1993227550851335	-1.1714621660240099	-0.7217140404527888	-0.49232987521849364	-0.4376093270729045	-0.3753587590712858	-0.3636206891152695	-0.27664532555840765	-0.1912716638305053	-0.17700736561447036	-0.12562115697313714	-0.08945294118777913	-0.02651256360526409	0.20993598891987003	0.2644198078870286	0.4580109616426862	0.6623876855279387	0.785241650625904	0.8272603527315673	0.8315252147411534	1.6596276054896861	3.0586279665830296	
Aro Tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a Mission in Guatemala in the 70's. Also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women, and then he set them on fire).<br /><br />This movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of Aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts.<br /><br />"Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious work, so analytical, it's not morbid at all. Such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster.<br /><br />*My rate: 7/10	-1.4331480342118221	-0.9841804278835558	-0.5480879032290515	-0.44334693092486244	-0.43260622128802473	-0.36413835974162817	-0.3514083629709482	-0.3303119843609932	-0.2506775937670976	-0.16299308631285114	-0.07306972964672669	-0.036888964795763104	-0.03301983831511573	0.04153124172433279	0.2165435074872641	0.25695959876264224	0.3391605372537822	0.35009464863793904	0.4005575152729296	0.4281647164759606	0.43089081853741024	0.5233920569495787	0.5406108579389837	0.7223744384678589	1.2904248813662846	
I saw this movie when I was a child. It blew me away. This was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young kid into orbit. It so impressed me, that I went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time. Sabu was a real delight, as was Rex Ingram as the Genie. I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for months after the film left town. I would recommend this movie to any and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet. Also, June Duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture. The color was outstanding. Give this movie an AAA!	-2.3680280120794364	-2.078828739252597	-2.016417607581988	-1.5459755851863468	-1.2132221748044707	-0.5776081196400981	-0.4464858207789869	-0.4440555722666287	-0.39021386820486226	-0.13802294578957164	-0.05297871625440985	0.006747324032848001	0.07266469249787497	0.1591565369994952	0.3520390397382671	0.5110500803712978	0.8045819243235729	0.9095068946200195	0.9251717994364035	0.9875574406723585	1.0336052405892844	1.567690910898152	2.6385038861712786	2.9854998334182765	3.33111463570701	
Like one of the previous commenters said, this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a waste because Collette's performance was eerie and Williams was believable. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it could have just been the film. It came across as a Canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, it needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump off your seat. The movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax. I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the "reality" of the story but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie needs to have a Director's cut that tries to fix these problems.	-4.66572983210463	-2.15523533771698	-2.06386396480341	-1.8678911957313995	-1.7441182928373966	-1.4619150341973424	-1.4602249623464334	-0.5008472799200558	-0.47645037972142257	-0.2944573291625702	-0.28339518135453023	-0.22603986373633844	-0.1131910997269213	0.12563595675949352	0.1376932158654247	0.24944700220945287	0.49004550872358016	0.4934759735420149	0.6444290878916543	0.8193352871968489	0.9509738594755005	1.4250158826574615	1.4910365551414508	2.69590641391045	5.27363500993397	
This is available on a "Drive In Double Feature" from Dark Sky Films, and since I just had finished up "Barracuda", I watched this too. This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time.<br /><br />We begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town, but where exactly are they? They stop to look at necklaces from some Chinese vendor, and try on Chinese-style clothes at a shop, but then we see some Aztec dancers? And all the while, these girls are being followed by two guys, who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town, and they finally catch them.<br /><br />It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? So, in flashback, we go back to find out. And how did they know she had this coin? Hard to say, really.<br /><br />Now, back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat, and after stopped to get air in their tanks, they tow this young boy back to his home dock, only to have his grandpa come out & invite the "young 'uns" up for herbal tea with granny. But not everyone has the tea, Todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls, and then when they're away from it, the boat blows up, and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems as though these "kindly folk" raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell, and serve it herbal tea.<br /><br />But the girls and Todd did leave the island, but now, they're returning, escorted by their captors, and they're there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was BEFORE. There also seems to be someone else on the island, and the thugs mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there's only three, it doesn't take long. And there's even a sort of happy ending, which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues, and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious. The hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability, despite the fact that the grandpa is Hank Worden, who appeared in many films and TV shows. The action is confusing, the locales are even more confusing, and the island looks like Southern California.<br /><br />So what the hell IS this? I'm not sure, but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.	-10.856532709900518	-4.7933741942448105	-4.718702529717356	-3.888409555358522	-3.8615023335086245	-3.4935894090573694	-2.0540351789701767	-1.555943763864371	-0.9230612529549674	-0.8184376843203754	-0.3519232862400079	-0.12178151493171391	-0.04516985624259356	0.03304662620225865	0.5953305977980189	0.6455511965835282	1.0846147284295984	1.1043514958518748	1.3307684511130713	1.4649638116382495	1.4855762541897002	2.2568264471047033	5.1262392018694785	5.8568775534323745	12.12668038682342	
This film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department. awful, awful, awful. It's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an Andy Warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />Where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve. This film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />A particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average English accent "God damn". To right that woman. God damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />Everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves. Let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.	-5.341283459042701	-3.1387600278012977	-2.8770908850358374	-2.875801059518379	-2.7810747244684464	-1.4067990102878383	-1.0290485667296783	-0.9421795933343516	-0.7065145528092996	-0.676548808831792	-0.561688171466485	-0.5167607782442967	-0.43663255006049967	-0.013093696875183664	-0.0013190994846608017	0.05745288308573038	0.24375882827018963	0.49299639607746826	0.6561806472741389	0.7535949718036571	0.8895351633837987	1.2693028727154025	2.2880762784310553	3.0980905041323212	4.766118554166088	
Although, I had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie, this sure as hell wasn't what I would have had in mind, had anything actually come to mind. Once I heard of its existence, all I knew was that I had to own a movie called Please Don't Eat The Babies. unfortunately, I could only find a copy under its alternate title, Island Fury. Looking back, I guess I could call it a lose-lose situation. On one hand, I still don't get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called Please Don't Eat The Babies, and on the other hand, Island Fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful, pointless, boring, unwatchable piece of garbage. Yeah, definitely lose-lose.<br /><br />I'm not even sure what genre they're going for here. Just early 80's badness, with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non-flashback. First up, two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys, once caught, the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string, around her neck, and somehow, these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere. And this is where things start to get weird, somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island, years earlier, when they were only 10. I guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is. So, now, we're in the past, while the girls try to retrace their steps, so these bad guys don't kill them, although, I wouldn't have minded if they had. In the flashback, the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends, eventually stopping by an island for some air, they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents. Any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up, but the flashback was undeniably better than the present, which, still, isn't saying much.<br /><br />For a while there I had forgotten about the original story, At one point, I Ithought maybe the director had too, and when the flashback ended, that would be the end, which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half-hour shorter. This pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end, and real stuff does happen, but it's stupid. I guess I didn't exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured, or anything like that, but I did expect some form of outlandish B-entertainment, mostly just a confusing, inept storyline, unsure of its genre. My advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like Attack Of The Beast Creatures. If anyone, I would only recommend this one to serious B-movie collectors who must have them all, anyone else interested probably has brain damage. What really gets me is that I still have no idea why they called it Please Don't Eat The Babies. 3/10	-12.6529881359261	-5.798742478690412	-5.763239647339576	-5.6248015835888605	-5.477508491806378	-4.011525822279171	-2.682216544203909	-1.2203332154363014	-1.1570983304506894	-1.1346977977995014	-0.7311356841417377	-0.6763422017342283	-0.16180822756627483	-0.007833675917093932	0.22381338171329612	0.6878314244307541	0.8379641314409884	0.8963588796178995	1.163030602985358	1.8358430542122977	1.9887262990638097	1.9905128362906546	5.460784836423151	6.94631830525695	13.434298778998562

The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) titled "Our Family Trouble." To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line.

This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that I've ever seen. Closely followed by none other than "Before Sunset", which technically isn't another movie at all, since it's about the same two people and the same romance.<br /><br />This is "love" in the real world. OK, that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie. Reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog-based movies as well. And this is what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialog is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and funny. It's hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop, where they pretend to phone their best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend. It's PERFECT. Brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.<br /><br />I must say that if you have a choice, do watch "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before Sunset". If like me, you watched "Sunset" first, it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.<br /><br />Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations. Young love, at it's best.	-5.062767061407585	-4.383618233028765	-2.922249986292337	-2.769515624709949	-2.3467723286127424	-0.9171540682088687	-0.5580989974605004	-0.08847596770770566	0.2020067752573038	0.5263914986097354	0.8305451936185186	0.8359771256725834	0.9707002627032189	1.131797911267985	1.1897183958153765	1.2989649072425151	1.332874754868024	1.4886595726970049	1.5084208176090586	1.89501586543464	2.0979952706863583	2.400003459836049	4.869751451470394	5.924891759301425	6.1972767522890315	
I had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for New Year's and she picked out The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2 and we just watched both films, while she's sleeping, I figured I could get a couple comments in. :) While this is a very cheesy cartoon, it really wasn't that bad. You have to admit that for children, these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them.<br /><br />Odette finds out that Derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of Rosthoe and she tells Derek to destroy them immediately, but him being a guy, typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the magics without his help. When a witch named Zelda gets her hands on them, she finds out that Derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything, and she kidnaps Odette in order to retrieve this information.<br /><br />The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom is silly and predictable, but for the kids I would honestly say it's a go. It's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days, so I'm going to cut the film some slack. It was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden, I grew up with the first one, so I guess it was just stuck in my head.<br /><br />4/10	-3.4937714201145513	-2.1456753250271565	-2.136052400349577	-2.1003921789366125	-1.9262197457948025	-0.7312106726802208	-0.5215900191254017	-0.511060544996391	-0.49328698497873047	-0.4632335807043181	-0.41141511544631443	-0.4009122675883411	-0.35173145689257207	-0.3343543176957458	-0.09413612630170051	0.0998449675338946	0.1341508552190983	0.22932060487737926	0.4962272740211995	0.677258763971335	0.8358826001517166	1.7065991516643548	1.7863828069434469	2.731562248654465	4.5455507473754615	
I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. The replacement of RDA in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.<br /><br />The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.<br /><br />RDA gives his 'O'Neill' character believable personality. He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.<br /><br />There is a lot going on between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' under the surface. They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. The episode 'Solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.<br /><br />'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'O'Neill'. Yet 'O'Neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. He understands what to do without having to think about the matter. The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.<br /><br />The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.<br /><br />The spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. The villains (Wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.<br /><br />There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.<br /><br />I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. In the season 2 opener, 'Daniel Jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. The episode 'Hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC, yet it is never mentioned again. This device could have been used in several later episodes on 'Daniel', 'O'Neill', and 'Dr. Frasier'.	-10.29025333858814	-6.747219275373944	-4.80382126194783	-4.592516217124674	-2.9179899595802103	-2.4975964120495666	-2.4265705784685365	-2.3044735584700913	-1.434844098917865	-0.49979092462826064	-0.43287684903880885	-0.0452508669757428	0.05274620767676584	0.1467099625974435	0.3796222315103224	0.47100695453680297	1.5309022422815906	1.6311129966142712	2.240425265159505	2.6476446545206755	2.8337230353235214	3.083802591500781	4.3544749912104646	6.039449964305442	11.974269141499189	
Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I would marry. Never boring, always thinking positively, good with animals. Okay, as one reviewer wrote, a bit too much peroxide, lipstick, and eyebrows (Only Madonna could get away with that). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your ordinary girl. She makes things happen, always exciting to be around, and always honest. Sure, she steals, but she doesn't rob or murder (unless you're out to do her in). She knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed. She knows what to take and what can't be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she's in 100%. Bottom line: She knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (which is why she has a way with wild animals), and completely dedicated to those she loves, and who love her.<br /><br />Who's That Girl? She's the girl for me.	-3.781855820858218	-3.3091380738513574	-1.4621238907318863	-1.3482149215598458	-1.1148678929357243	-0.9587309850007043	0.26295957807134107	0.2815900238344152	0.2971155660368761	0.304094303601742	0.3980620007176855	0.4296358958711904	0.5731418021673931	0.6106571727676326	0.7713959601913272	0.7793859093834463	0.8648635544974267	1.297941147664024	1.5079494594603866	1.556005113086674	1.8418463999096244	1.922145192707068	2.0200394079603656	2.562435764897146	4.241720188738663	
The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I've ever seen. Aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my "tilt switch" so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had. This movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7 years old, I recommend watching something else.<br /><br />GB	-2.3663123221370057	-1.4051113417489645	-1.1580821798035812	-0.9150541629910165	-0.8936310814619837	-0.6278870111230158	-0.5995185117423516	-0.522772894973455	-0.16510983783764976	-0.09380596156988978	-0.01568340332251244	-0.01121600635184257	0.03379576987650971	0.0397117256413565	0.09000553579285214	0.15846855085492245	0.24909778882690703	0.3446339822350738	0.46494378636795763	0.5690745426729564	0.7292090469596549	1.0067999943002948	1.3407237090041793	1.443823950706181	3.042183727692205	
This movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone, but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and performers (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in China. This makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance.<br /><br />A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.	-1.116327618717833	-1.0899417219902678	-0.8842263529493267	-0.8401419485592394	-0.8071070144924961	-0.45169165065056394	-0.37056259835606725	-0.28482697652164624	-0.23877169155013445	-0.23723819313268737	-0.051542500864398225	0.028642196145093668	0.04735342927088121	0.07104104696236656	0.13544238856814733	0.18983042950746773	0.27043110570646056	0.31412727099312915	0.45172573021505863	0.5930465719506419	0.7166065891658842	0.8130061749408025	0.9625027409500625	1.4032783855218498	1.89588765072973	
An updated version of a theme which has been done before.

When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible, the cause can invariably be found in the book: either it was pointless to start with, or the point is one not easily conveyed to film, or the movie missed the point, which is the most frequent of these results, and the easiest to happen, especially when the point is one not easily defined. The book "Morvern Callar" has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this, and felt as if he had gotten it; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words. I'm not sure I can, myself, but perhaps it comes to this, or something like it: Things come, things go, such is life, but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like Morvern--do. No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition. But the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view, and to carry over, in adapting the story to film. The maker of this film evidently missed the point, and doesn't substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing.<br /><br />This is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated. The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly: in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance, and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly. The narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated Morvern, but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect, as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone, as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not: for instance, despite Morvern's own self-characterization as a raver, am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class Scots girl, and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past? In any case, despite my irritation at the author, I couldn't deny that his book stuck with me; and what I couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude, her angle on the world, which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait. Morvern is the kind of person who's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her, like flies, so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through, unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesn't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough. The complex of incidents and of Morvern's responses to them are the substance of the book, and its achievement, in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book, I can see this.<br /><br />The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen. An actress who might have been a good fit for the character, had she been the right age at the right time, is Angharad Rees, from the old TV series "Poldark". Samantha Morton, then, would seem like good casting: she's rather the same sort of actress, and in one of her earlier movies, "Jesus' Son", she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one. Unfortunately, as the film turned out, she doesn't have the character from the book to play. For one thing, the book is one that, if it is to be dramatized, virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments, her perspective, her voice, the story loses most of its meaning. It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty, and so Morvern's responses (whether of amusement or distaste, depending on her mood) are missing too, and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story. In short, the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk, edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art TV film, and chose as her typical image one of Ms. Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross. This isn't at all what the book, or the Morvern of the book, was about. For another thing, the Morvern of the movie isn't Scottish (the actress said in an interview she hadn't had time to study up the accent), and she ought to be: it's important that she, her family, and her mates are all from a single place. And finally the film is missing the end of the story: Morvern's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness: it's winter, the dam has frozen, the power has gone out, and the pub is dark. Minus this, and minus all of the rest, what's left is a failed art film, a dead film, about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal, or native inability, ever to give in to being dead.	-14.120692865738592	-8.000746937328278	-7.967015090358081	-7.569884088251285	-7.384757255472211	-2.9045344164108875	-2.7168347216826056	-1.6672462981307363	-1.6083640613308179	-1.586156926207045	-1.347620149076768	-0.8850578518661812	-0.8030829116601235	-0.09989876759916602	0.30081373588477356	0.7683069997215375	0.8093203382371799	1.3164175627935546	2.0847641723991837	2.7447289514232183	2.8243200993979194	3.7971419721982302	4.464547810460056	9.006921056218552	15.332841274841133	
I was all ready to pan this episode, seeing that this 'Master' really doesn't have any horror films under his belt.. but this is easily the best episode of the season.<br /><br />The acting was good!! I don't know how he wrangled it, but we've got some real talent in this episode! And while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise, at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins, something that has been lacking up to this point in the series.<br /><br />I especially liked the bit at the end, not a twist per say, but just a funny little bit where he becomes, as ever, the hen-pecked hubby.<br /><br />Really good effort. Like I've said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes.. but they may someday end up being masters in the future.	-1.9641017129007494	-1.9551716486026036	-1.5859244013276945	-1.3266537754476366	-1.129022376558967	-0.8957413600267771	-0.511864497517226	-0.47944922362750053	-0.30716900868534197	-0.18500715365751902	-0.06450898725393253	-0.008448356692525999	0.015464818146287307	0.3273137457572345	0.3487078989325052	0.37061820140713586	0.43333746510439847	0.4791152696062926	0.5524848053704158	0.5880607172476562	0.5883802553104787	0.6804961964806748	1.4632657744034046	2.044962512762672	2.9076182200627954	
Absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. Whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.<br /><br />P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT bad.	-4.98632334091292	-3.867457035805856	-3.3906256545127462	-3.369745529120556	-2.9322251950662075	-1.6723026483742922	-1.1406155890967524	-0.927915527398447	-0.4795141599153196	-0.33636019343733764	-0.18320337946046555	-0.05870405507207763	0.01608084188531078	0.15208036722326077	0.4189334104520802	0.5682680508781088	0.6038517506220867	0.619433103957276	0.7270639442994863	1.198578473597704	1.631378178335949	1.6635244899858852	1.9323669116941917	4.339942011016075	7.787804330518094	
This is the very first Three Stooges short with Shemp that I saw, and it is one of my favorites! <br /><br />That is what I really liked about Shemp when he returned after Curly's stroke, he did not try to be like Curly, he was his own character, and that is what I admire! Shemp is my favorite third stooge, I like him more than Curly, but I like Curly as much as I do Shemp. Shemp is great, he's funny, he's silly, he's SHEMP! <br /><br />I really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and Moe got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt! <br /><br />But what I really thought was scary was when Shemp had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth, he looked like a deformed Professor Snape!<br /><br />Poor Shemp, he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short, but that is just typical Three Stooges, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! <br /><br />This short is another must see for Three Stooges fans! <br /><br />10/10	-2.1944250430506327	-1.978392482338752	-1.9623621058644312	-1.7678707341928663	-1.1725696556982086	-0.8640177865810508	-0.5172622322725628	-0.3229022231399157	-0.2764473276381405	-0.19103018288381496	-0.001317469526605275	0.06982264563894636	0.07426094880768555	0.11611160333503598	0.12266551693794034	0.18216298669497524	0.30509150127258955	0.48037565677563576	0.7914189133683612	1.0794972687355613	1.1815707284410337	1.3947081482106183	1.7519881436223914	2.3937937251495778	3.6758635955854206	
This isn't so much a review of A Tale Of Two Sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details, so I advise you NOT to read this review if you haven't seen the film, because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you.<br /><br />In a way A Tale Of Two Sisters is far from original, at least from a purely superficial aspect - some of its iconography is taken straight from Ring or Dark Water, while the storyline itself (especially what Brendt Sponseller calls the "rubber reality" aspect of the narrative) is reminiscent of films like Fight Club (lead character interacts with someone created in their mind), Mulholland Drive (character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue), as well as other minor aspects of Lost Highway, Jacob's Ladder, and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness, plus Amenabar's films (The Others, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory), et al. Thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film's overall emotional impact, and I personally found A Tale Of Two Sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience.<br /><br />Many people have commented on the "confusing" nature of the narrative, but I personally found the storyline to be fairly self-explanatory, even if it is in part portrayed in a non-sequential manner. The narrative only becomes confusing for some because, midway through the final third, the story switches from a purely subjective setting (ie. Soo-Mi's warped perception of reality) to an objective one, with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of Soo-Mi's nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness. The shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard, but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned Mulholland Drive (even though we're not dealing with a character's perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies - something which, in turn, reminded me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway). To be honest, I don't really regard A Tale Of Two Sisters as a Horror movie as such, but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness (and I hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film).<br /><br />That aside, the cinematography in A Tale Of Two Sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films I've seen this side of Wong Kar Wai's 2046. The performances are also fantastic without exception, and I expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future; not to mention the music, but then east Asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days.<br /><br />It's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of A Tale Of Two Sisters and simply dismiss it as "yet another Asian horror film", oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach. But then each to their own. If you can ignore some of the film's platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart, ie. an extremely tragic, heart-breaking story, then I see no reason not to recommend it.	-4.221693128995737	-3.3280411776316154	-3.007527835651802	-2.609486005264298	-2.3944862905307	-1.6872075221300757	-0.9925693737022605	-0.5521661721020479	-0.2196181528038309	-0.1396405912051346	0.007139625080474646	0.01619840067302735	0.1475649404501404	0.1644904696477346	0.24471296783914354	0.2949269449334825	0.31714524859396215	0.6544020132644464	0.9056542657529234	1.3297292992229433	1.428042600640577	1.7102208666375291	1.8017789305209357	4.048573944949579	6.849213612900836	
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.<br /><br />Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. We then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. The writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. For instance, Model Behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew; Falling in Lust Again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel; She's the Boss is about a put-upon male secretary/dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. All the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. Even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. The sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. The camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. Finally, the end credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida although my map of Florida shows no Singer Island. The scenery certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a UK DVD release. 4 stars.	-5.331718882507651	-3.212960687589445	-2.4102418091074935	-2.291717785424555	-1.5979780537193844	-1.5879797804329403	-1.499340954664127	-1.0434426288086283	-0.678292479054701	-0.5596880766827949	-0.2856405084836843	0.16878013479545695	0.21416156678874185	0.2728930692718493	0.29397021066297685	0.6596543586471848	0.79657826798109	0.9136362726470593	0.9246665187808625	1.0238489031942133	1.4150692887320595	1.5539681411507682	1.699613029621731	3.294627569209901	6.747727227623788	
Outstanding film of 1943 with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to America from Europe as the Nazi menace deepened.<br /><br />The usual terrific Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943.<br /><br />Encounting treachery around them, Lukas successfully deals with the situation. He knows he must return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return he does.<br /><br />Davis again pulls out all the stops with a Katharine Hepburn-like shedding of tears when they must part. Resolute, she knows that her older son, must follow him on his path to liberty.<br /><br />A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe.	-1.5865023355205015	-1.121199904713928	-0.8038716870053427	-0.5577256306186535	-0.30035745434168276	-0.28256930826626536	-0.2585488312338655	-0.19581142992064005	-0.18674699982739393	-0.155555427251323	-0.05392643560606168	-0.03163964525055234	-0.018187660418347296	0.2606562985456695	0.30314149918349786	0.304681323872995	0.40312613605333514	0.5254552743451953	0.5521385504137403	0.6460772357559598	0.8848284304927498	0.9611586775382768	1.1621501329418167	1.519412120634495	1.522622806907068	
I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast, and "unsinkable"... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.<br /><br />So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(David Warner), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith(Bernard Hill), Molly Brown(Kathy Bates), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome	-6.156214290848678	-3.4861442436013146	-3.3085718538169018	-2.9783816030237706	-1.716805557189404	-1.5569795253147614	-1.5155523736207992	-1.0243188910254943	-0.569843646006384	-0.3685493999101953	-0.2997075788980883	-0.23109811720632667	-0.13472611238614385	0.04470966589176742	0.5908652051940628	0.689962545093357	0.7240935446677439	0.8346067866086533	0.8685214214288757	1.2547006120146798	1.823040274353455	2.2437726513072027	3.929895426334731	4.656144905292895	6.247369141928299	
whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch Iron Eagle III, but from looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the always delightful "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to fill the role of Doug Masters (Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks just like Jason Gedrick from the first Iron Eagle). But wait(Here comes a possible spoiler).....Wasn't Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? The writers must've been desprate for a story so they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest done of all the Iron Eagle films. Why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies? (ex. Police Academy movies). I have always liked Gossett Jr.'s work in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. Let's hope this was the last of the Iron Eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.	-5.4146594089804605	-4.682385465816479	-3.1509713742715704	-3.036412826259093	-2.2700951768023376	-1.9099715487470785	-1.34177883861282	-0.46441675979831526	-0.2651051736397797	-0.2088165772878583	-0.05190202717197892	-0.024057021374776413	0.18077723157880532	0.27979871989289196	0.346172749081404	0.39329214585677014	0.6118002578220859	0.6318227349923015	1.0751902659593586	1.3352790998416586	1.4428094633118196	1.4913429294726583	2.2069226167290124	3.606933716738413	7.3163053240404405	
Well, at least my theater group did, lol. So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch. I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that's why I decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to give it a shot, but I called them up and just laughed. First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and T-Birds continue years on after the former gangs left? Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these T-Birds were just stupid and ridiculous.<br /><br />Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. But when a new student who is Sandy's cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie. But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the T-Birds, so the new student, decides to train as a T-Bird to win her heart. So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the T-Bird's butts. But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own? Well, find out for yourself.<br /><br />Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didn't work. The gang didn't click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she didn't. The songs were not really that catchy; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.<br /><br />2/10	-6.189533792752297	-3.5398116718670725	-2.5955964021240723	-2.156163803253345	-1.832420538109763	-1.7003991676255004	-1.2790260570335379	-0.8598579085112162	-0.6639658031366505	-0.43073280327822494	-0.23256268945226727	-0.20391721244756392	-0.18610829282948177	0.1922165907831918	0.46938679558847546	0.8513429733569309	0.8828308914763571	0.8999704545216296	1.0435909198332858	1.1311155047625023	1.2163408925511998	1.263589730337981	1.6116520731369193	3.622706138449956	7.264865103870528	
This is one very dire production. The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the production's weakest point, the actress failed to get that across. It also appeared that the production budget couldn't stretch to a hairdresser - from the outset, the hair on the Princess Margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush. The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was farcical.<br /><br />The production was a flaw ridden, cliché ridden, embarrassing load of rubbish.

How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a '1'?<br /><br />I thought "Manos, the Hands of Fate" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. Indeed, I didn't think anything COULD be worse.<br /><br />I was wrong. "Galaxina" is that rare movie where EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. How often have you watched a movie and commented, "Who the hell LIT this thing?" From lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . . well, EVERYTHING, this movie is absolutely unendurable. It's so bad, I couldn't even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I'd ever seen.<br /><br />It's too bad even to be laughable. I'd sooner eat a platefull of broken glass than sit through it again.	-5.078168376601261	-2.5997890635272647	-2.500432098682747	-2.4027564400282304	-2.138184077097107	-1.6724625066144887	-1.430071252800353	-1.0482685001424066	-0.7538323381281242	-0.25114873028548007	-0.20158446242619943	-0.04462296914420404	-0.002266430222417312	0.05132922648326776	0.09602444346974232	0.2418502292811295	0.332933109617354	0.38102713373202957	0.44294233632138885	0.48572754903399473	0.5970636679783975	0.7375929700520903	1.796292564836199	2.5703289064059396	5.64910738130462	
Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore.<br /><br />Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low down.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.<br /><br />Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.<br /><br />Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.<br /><br />Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.<br /><br />Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's.<br /><br />Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.<br /><br />So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.<br /><br />Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)	-6.198025629185033	-5.569712401488766	-3.8857342506002976	-2.9059860225850866	-2.345160779867787	-1.882603039567533	-1.786750781345658	-1.657913995317695	-0.696591402307208	-0.5444772456540272	-0.5240195679721974	-0.453450146224613	-0.44923863033447664	-0.06921977825178652	0.05473350269019442	0.20213136160947692	0.24565632132990095	0.25204313262238287	2.1445729283390658	2.7528948119696928	3.506435971723459	4.289539205367348	5.2296727222716175	6.349001036743547	9.359496308824347	
2001 wasn't perhaps Eric Roberts best year. Both Raptor and this came out. Watched Raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being Erics worst. But that had it´s share moment of fun and D-standard. This one doesn't have a thing.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days. The story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves.<br /><br />The two thing that stands out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. You could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism.<br /><br />I say thank you Roberts see you next time (and hopefully a better one).	-2.799271615471552	-1.8121620369633027	-1.8062735344791399	-1.0998018195888861	-1.063997156436937	-1.0239442843584585	-0.8110120144658387	-0.3468423309398991	-0.2470852450884245	-0.17033712930599135	-0.08213564529459423	-0.062166425958924965	-0.04776184975681352	0.10825372040826949	0.1139880667800868	0.2682704814098217	0.4010963844403245	0.49658489574099896	0.5815656478532288	0.7187157100921931	0.8554224465890183	1.0527275014587145	1.1159070527108226	2.0868130560714153	3.8329498292932582	
German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.<br /><br />Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.<br /><br />The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.<br /><br />The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall.<br /><br />Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.<br /><br />More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride.<br /><br />After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.<br /><br />Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.	-13.583152344704956	-6.686402803005509	-6.572436039733457	-5.920686633261988	-5.573183783107962	-3.6982643911871937	-3.249241811224876	-1.0774706213432945	-1.075855960651151	-0.8425239391189185	-0.7921450437910206	-0.7794977405331689	-0.38978804377781867	0.8852145183953258	1.109177457974656	1.369541672723216	1.4329077438071833	1.8602870437915278	2.013275227678304	2.0938621838972407	2.4204250259124005	2.756322014685432	3.821616093552135	7.98776830886932	15.66301702155051	
Steven Seagal, Mr. Personality himself, this time is the United States' greatest Stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military(..who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base, later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station)if he is able to successfully infiltrate a Northern Afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called Black Sunday, who have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter thanks to an American traitor. Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor, Jannick(Mark Bazeley), John Sands(Seagal)will fly into enemy territory, receiving help from his Arab lover, Jessica(Ciera Payton)and a freedom fighter, Rojar(Alki David) once they are on ground. Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders, Stone(Vincenzo Nicoli)and his female enforcer, Eliana(Katie Jones), and Sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter, but rescue him as well. And, maybe, Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained, Rather(Steve Toussaint)in the process. Sands has 72 hours until a General's Navy pilots bomb the entire area. On board the stealth, Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb, hoping to detonate it on the United States.<br /><br />Seagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he isn't slicing their throats with knives. The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead. The setting of Afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny(..nor does how easily Seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about. The movie is edited fast, the camera a bit too jerky. Seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes, unlike the good old days. One of Seagal's poorest efforts, and he's as understated as ever(..not a compliment). Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains, tis a shame. He doesn't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way(..sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around, but it's not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close-ups).	-10.26618675564694	-3.5671589618369013	-3.4706824032892625	-2.9987827887127034	-2.660401058425511	-2.452429318415638	-1.4920117585876196	-1.4223722469269338	-0.931819954965372	-0.8596225233072056	-0.32017274693930853	-0.2750220272929038	-0.2328339779926846	-0.06238686322321586	-0.009652843811151366	0.26053817368818843	0.2884517643952664	0.34036924067407776	0.9308367741702676	0.9369551961561853	1.0074523044437709	1.636209472391609	3.784462303936498	4.337094819484228	9.061519025296677	
This movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning, but never fleshed out to it's expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the Asian directors), but doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. The story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explainable, interesting angle. Basically, the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases. The acting was very good, however. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding as he is always is. It is too bad he chose to do such a weak film.	-2.382582700901688	-1.1881648641527254	-1.06921044013569	-0.9436077787593704	-0.7327267627757288	-0.5843306004098562	-0.4704645183701195	-0.2122269520992648	-0.18896251022117305	-0.10508257624149603	-0.004641888994338678	0.1697750911535257	0.2957322378040585	0.3387539364633082	0.380253095706505	0.44769361097025945	0.5231759955548178	0.5736942765631874	0.626126752692136	0.9241082382092013	0.9576957386073511	1.0647602958765927	1.95104019804404	2.2605010433300032	2.5814677017343186	
This was the very first movie I ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive-in theatre. I did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time (I went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie). After seeing it on the television-along with two of my other favourite movies Car Wash (my favourite movie) and The Wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together-about 40, 50, 75 times I knew that here was a movie that I would have as one of my favourites. Those three movies were the only live action shows that I could watch as a child. <br /><br />I would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie.Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the Wild Irish Rose that they drank. My mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life. If you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn't seen this movie yet then I recommend that you buy the DVD right now. I'm glad that I was around to witness some of the goings on of the era.	-3.215393130006981	-2.5023957560616017	-1.7100931757555877	-1.3182234832395632	-1.3175548677603395	-0.9237348305467434	-0.5989934575527781	-0.37369878997354083	-0.16998926589142435	-0.1435501272331439	-0.10543962129595036	0.12156106527294927	0.13406690503454133	0.18108475073184957	0.2860974981049815	0.3080877963019541	0.3902114474278079	0.5747216843927101	0.5971520774144857	0.604431007566332	0.6230622371879746	0.8193990633614784	1.596925009119778	2.038329882718239	4.0709428408936965	
This is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by "Friday the 13th". "The Prey" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. The woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.<br /><br />But "The Prey" is as bad as you might expect. I didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.<br /><br />Well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of Jason. The situations rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. It just does not works for a slasher flick.<br /><br />The acting is simply horrid. The score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?! I won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me, it seems that it cost only 20 dollars.<br /><br />Please avoid this one like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something to say. Thank God it seems to have vanished from earth.	-8.366283813949053	-4.0601147587845	-3.93189220568349	-3.931136749992911	-3.438325155650451	-1.9343705745854665	-1.2125908644969654	-1.2001866953213114	-0.8232822824380225	-0.6517248876528469	-0.6422748978377201	-0.5825437294374537	-0.1361568652359309	0.46238769649662315	0.49260187271834244	0.6106695792268307	0.8094631810230695	0.8251365209645501	1.0461663146422364	1.3705210530069665	1.5272684247578208	1.7373824191609661	2.4141417911734715	4.989783612925612	8.744462503151322	
The unlikely duo of Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in The Angel Levine. It's one interesting twist on the themes from It's A Wonderful Life.<br /><br />Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly Jewish poor in New York. Mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade, but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly bedridden. He's reduced to applying for welfare. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cries out to God for some help.<br /><br />Now maybe if he had gotten someone like Henry Travers things might have worked out differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing going for him, he was over 100 years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone. God sent Mostel something quite different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment.<br /><br />Belafonte hasn't accepted he's moved on from life, he's still got a lot of issues. He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who doesn't know he's passed on, hit by a car right at the beginning of the film. You put his issues and Mostel's issues and you've got a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel can't believe in a black Jew named Levine.<br /><br />This was the farewell performance for Polish/Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky who got a nomination for Best Actress in The Shop on Main Street a few years back. The other prominent role here is that of Irish actor Milo O'Shea playing a nice Jewish doctor.

This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, the horror!. Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn't Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?	-4.211132382629969	-1.5598286854559933	-1.339031054182576	-1.2131815351878918	-1.096275972021346	-1.046198863179386	-0.6268648968513432	-0.563747172300937	-0.5488183590260064	-0.37407849960111195	-0.34155022045097233	-0.17638213986242152	-0.057370336005547785	-0.041725577081791476	8.274413863403503E-4	0.2347246586071804	0.24766565549479544	0.2632437585698649	0.29504620345148663	0.35982555877313405	0.563108825773889	0.6229056323842349	1.5093641712571872	1.7735238108647546	3.8598098499611617	
This is a superb movie, suitable for all but the very youngest, though accessibility for younger people was marred (at least in the print which I saw) by the use of some unfortunate choice of English sub-titling! For much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set - there is no modern technology shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, just a drab, almost monochrome, everyday life, against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the Sezuan Opera and of celebratory fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war, this could still be any time in the past 150 years.<br /><br />But then we briefly see a motor car - late 30s, early 40s style - and we realise that we are watching a China on the verge of huge upheavals, and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of World War 2 and the Communist revolution.<br /><br />Which makes the central character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant.<br /><br />But the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today, both within China and in other parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; the trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship.<br /><br />Maybe I'm reading too much into this film; but I don't think so! I also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the United Kingdom, whilst dross is passed off as quality material.<br /><br />But don't get me started on that...	-3.0481692797763773	-2.0034638281290795	-1.761013709885683	-1.1832066821539695	-1.1696969991138662	-1.0877392493912044	-0.9866169668294102	-0.33775183550244814	-0.28159499093100515	-0.24367531157539168	-0.07505223133246035	0.055895279698681265	0.12613133209131044	0.13271228564043758	0.19890306893752416	0.421727558509791	0.4333159119754199	0.5305361068277498	0.7751742266930493	0.8410203925306508	0.8704958470719144	1.001901612603878	1.1592640914248675	2.7850544635645007	4.420898417949143	
Many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying... Men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone... a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today... soon u will know someone in the house has died... The dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji... One of the dead person's son is speaking with someone over the mobile, Daughter is busy with her makeup... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and T shirt over salwar kameez... another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office... Then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person... the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... Its Anupam Kher... suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed... Is it his dream or a flash back? U won't get an answer until the end of the movie...Well, This is wat comedy is for the director Dibakar Banerjee!!!!! Later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream. Is this a film comedy? Well it is supposed to belong to that category... But it actually does not!!! there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie!!! More over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from Police!!! so everyone must cheat the cheats!!!! or forget about Justice!!!! Music by Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is OK... Nothing much to tell about other sectors... Bad script destroys everything... not even Anupam Kher's performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool...	-4.740543173596602	-1.8107582339757353	-1.7782778135391242	-1.4110852823211566	-1.298545995076032	-1.1904059407375913	-1.0627411020182282	-0.9438395917830084	-0.5718668993738591	-0.5198902471544367	-0.31941559125673025	-0.09103963485477438	0.061058686095409015	0.1732713770981129	0.22347548138491627	0.23422038590877473	0.3233536345731586	0.3675519267380958	0.381025867443179	0.5089471717469843	0.6366486614058431	0.6602457590203823	1.5746471025888016	2.5454135327401133	4.387700894907963	
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this.

Hard to believe this was directed by Fritz Lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries. This movie has a cast that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west. Jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is in charge of the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride. Scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but Scott can't tell anyone. It's a pretty good western and Lang should of directed some more westerns.	-1.4821004219061173	-0.9994708551428662	-0.963323879092167	-0.5820382121432909	-0.37748195153226294	-0.30942352584081767	-0.23500582805077125	-0.1272958018839967	-0.12042131694657299	-0.11755829889882435	-0.01154152710328285	0.0037032956754569635	0.05607715225213464	0.136018079604624	0.14082277535948465	0.1486869796649456	0.17821431963587836	0.2628530611749351	0.27627268732236554	0.3007680824078043	0.4899082321101412	0.8902428657582186	1.0300952259766896	1.0891217878801123	1.6922055082238645	
www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html An excellent TV series that should be captured on DVD. This was a show I rarely missed. I found a petition to bring it back on DVD. I recall one show where this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her. Needless to say she could not eat her friends so she starved to death. Another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer & subway security branch. The accountant wanted to shut down the funding for the project. As it turns out the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html	-2.063322088363864	-1.5731689546520202	-1.025777238618619	-0.7681436607484797	-0.7410787887148698	-0.3565080930414874	-0.2521610807900267	-0.1068107972509381	-0.0723198850321503	-0.028585554773669364	-0.019685924781267707	0.09806419125692761	0.1599898447214452	0.20601210772934295	0.2807169353949387	0.287576131555445	0.32333878298435426	0.3275812573622891	0.34750813200428665	0.4060551095562652	0.7326979619073385	0.7775096922963479	1.2596544484240209	1.26541350363961	2.9714376167899417	
Now out of all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well. The view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places. With the mini-sub's weapons there, that would take out a whole school of sharks there. It was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity, although it would indeed cost him his life as well. Like they say revenge has it's price, but was it worth it? That answer could go on and on, and this movie was a major letdown. The beginning was fine, and at the end, it went like the Titanic. 1 OUT OF 5 STARS!	-2.0696945874550003	-1.778605075336749	-1.570160266597493	-1.473495178438935	-1.3229987435816828	-0.6216999364885571	-0.579942119761952	-0.47867852265094335	-0.45170729673200954	-0.4256048893054762	-0.3050963915401093	-0.1364719703030053	-0.12598994136274871	-0.006376801799962875	0.08301469252863765	0.10255576995914029	0.20887309557839273	0.29645873193122557	1.016035763197878	1.1346519927307872	1.170002096417973	1.4920776924879189	1.6484022096497781	2.2027296444401463	3.1030484206695026	
Without Kirsten Miller this project needn't have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.	-1.761990706548982	-1.5467352538619419	-1.3622359737277416	-0.983522687855961	-0.85541312299585	-0.7416161366414253	-0.4935349010407828	-0.4063570599397384	-0.17248612162632898	-0.06747956552188639	0.04417353566108971	0.0861790023805436	0.11744503345093443	0.2369255939931573	0.26575744591267947	0.29273985298812893	0.46185160998979385	0.4744887870967959	0.5077834152013425	0.5396049418462958	0.8381787498920578	1.1807950814382224	1.4978580652753237	1.9356335690321915	3.888782186270948	
as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time,and one of my personal favorites. to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time. it's underrated,and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people. it comes on TBS maybe once a year,but sometimes longer. the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest,and most of the time serious. with only a few comic scenes. in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time. i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before. there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history. the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin. hes in high school who has a couple of best friends. his two friends are sex-sarved teens. the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures. that are very funny. gary is major in love with the new girl in school. he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her. he also cheats on the side. you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much. you can feel it even more in the second half. gary's friend turns out to be a creep. but his other friend is pretty cool. the movie shows how mean people can be. you can relate to a lot of this movie. the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy. but it's so much more than that. it's a very honest movie. it's also very 80ish which i love. if you love the 80's or grew-up in the 80's,rent this movie. but there may be some people that don't like the 80's,but still may like this movie. i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think. it's very entertaining,and very funny. it combines very touching moments with very funny moments. it's an underrated gem! i have the movie. i love it! i give the last american virgin ***1/2 out of ****	-12.85453439968702	-11.696918327162804	-4.478602904655268	-3.916062213761728	-3.3543753499562707	-0.996148266819797	-0.9630184777740965	-0.1201521762487309	0.27747145853564453	0.9252893074801961	1.2925312962318707	1.5508391465358633	2.1164654739877857	2.3944919392592654	2.500489244137897	2.7344102541769466	2.821624947101604	3.1781704598629577	3.1842268944511507	4.312194349744017	4.4095563211948905	6.155224440641204	6.233153228450907	7.625101598148511	13.102715617018397	
Put simply, this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd plotting. 2. Over-acting. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create viewer interest.<br /><br />This film can't even pass the "Soap Opera for Dummies" test. I'm sorry I have not read this award-winning novel, so I am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went. That's like this film, with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out. There are enough stories and characters in this film to create a 20 episode series, yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all.<br /><br />There are more facial expressions and reaction shots of Ed Harris than you'll find on 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extraordinarily slow. <br /><br />Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so far over-the-top that their characters are not believable. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /><br />The persistent river metaphor becomes trite.<br /><br />And, probably the most absurd part of the film--the cat. This evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers--well, come on now---it's not even good Stephen King!<br /><br />Probably the most interesting character in the film, and one who is not drawn well, is John Voss, the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film.<br /><br />Just about everyone in this film is unbelievable.<br /><br />To sum up, there's little here to inspire. The drama is poor melodrama. It's just a terrible effort.	-11.212550432568461	-6.094154976368866	-4.666423308842595	-4.386467277910565	-3.666739042041117	-2.4679937700096057	-2.170210616754268	-1.6670748523312264	-1.2673275668108377	-1.1788462577881373	-1.0229268816717163	-1.0124691699474888	-0.1710377004466475	-0.1644839330543562	0.11511637650639552	0.223736010866	0.7136927079688367	0.8399004668433827	1.6500675593716911	1.789582645070761	1.9625997056614002	2.28559357109635	3.0941363357453917	5.3781780300734185	10.38847797514634	
Magnificent, original, beautiful movie. The acting is great, the settings en decors are superb (Paris at its best- but then the real Paris, not the famous settings) and the music will do also. A brilliant storie, very detailed, which I just very much love.<br /><br />The best French movie I've seen (and French cinema is very good)!	-3.383890495895631	-1.2021002763650444	-1.1704852618580004	-0.7469800124307902	-0.6563314545318032	-0.4503612407914646	-0.2627998608791151	-0.21427576217551206	-0.06786990926593643	-0.007473670305691876	0.08200341807688785	0.12904268161977772	0.4383961728943269	0.7453055051161235	1.0275898247415856	1.160743717189252	1.2042665926737022	1.3095316940346697	1.469230631236654	2.0907153426457654	2.1692679383096456	2.1990044524583876	2.5034588086462315	2.9880035950378603	3.031986728343894	
This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the Eighth Circle, Tenth Bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. Sandow Birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.<br /><br />Stocking Hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. It is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite. Nothing in Birk's unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite his smug pretension to the contrary. <br /><br />I could have eaten a reel of video tape and PUKED a better movie. I regret the two hours of my life that I lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry. Calliope will weep forever.	-4.001861166468399	-2.5205646345066333	-2.339586325144887	-2.3184874002483857	-2.072318771008443	-0.7195706170202802	-0.6902170438226063	-0.38153141893849524	-0.33616067879282185	-0.2426432731773131	-0.166034373538923	-0.09513814454262409	-0.0060235756290443875	0.03545076757809743	0.053671768731821334	0.1501224489739228	0.35748348003925057	0.6050824993184747	0.7514703573313781	0.7802671263983594	0.8119091283254012	0.8894572353179973	1.1074724063943042	2.5893739019605726	4.251165286128802	
Well its about time. I had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries. While there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries, at least this episode turned out well. Its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only has the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season. In "Right To Die" we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation. Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back. While they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire. And this is just the setup people. Once in the hospital Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes. There's also a side effect too. Every time she flatlines, Abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever. From the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists I never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to go on living forever.	-3.0920447308375936	-3.0888669741748735	-2.3333925774806397	-1.721046480181986	-1.4383694227195092	-1.2031266409361832	-0.4793933671735086	-0.18140955023674196	-0.10788936071145866	-0.05196126035333831	0.1243119185750496	0.12443962888182641	0.2453925347887836	0.2583041740084216	0.27095167343149906	0.45348584372540135	0.5142394735614609	0.6190347019385601	0.630526557042661	0.7658435896110823	1.0100037282798815	1.7246853381039764	1.7258508987075873	1.985883570484339	4.746289821061829	
I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is. I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which normally make for an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again. The acting was so awful that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them. The script was so poor, if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I shouldn't be in the least surprised. The direction and production is so amateur, I wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video. Utter Utter drivel. Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again, I can't imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst film I have seen in my entire life.	-6.280482801202414	-3.978432105840649	-3.6283696381930364	-3.1168396699431247	-3.068328397362085	-2.1358257550572146	-1.6865816880308155	-1.1667833690518288	-0.552603884265746	-0.47331269386769276	-0.13028696807323087	0.13270596294549253	0.1693639961216913	0.17817031902820749	0.20469529248780607	0.2717259865517371	0.3952220757597537	0.459214695929953	0.7639966544452262	1.074405868960261	1.075536356654484	1.6823476366917183	1.8757485427935947	4.5266043827081415	7.308511238176185	
When I think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what I think of. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. The film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent. I can't believe people are giving it the high ratings I've read here. Basically a forgettable, poor attempt at recreating a beloved era of the past. Two stars is all I can come up with. Sorry, guys.	-3.70843170408069	-2.262282125644623	-1.9379567983108865	-1.735702502101088	-1.5348422388150462	-1.4960299941390252	-0.9046776516863368	-0.7784983460339134	-0.3757481203619723	-0.16121828834423635	-0.1555369173585544	-0.10831793162004738	-0.10645714211270292	-0.01013900540295408	-0.00489631694276807	0.2432548818699787	0.31683501124970426	0.43332100366139426	0.6192750772182325	0.6653866565461574	0.8312450326390143	0.9721011830897712	1.3390343634481792	2.476172230757953	4.500653444696707	
People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no exception. Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but, I'm glad to say, this movie isn't one of them (over nine million dollars, which I don't think was bad for back then). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie. I didn't think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for little kids (the targeted audience for this movie), but I thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids' movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years.	-1.0861088589510524	-0.9941207505765157	-0.9909737841772541	-0.725690284263405	-0.6488458202785042	-0.6271557286609319	-0.5087443462508803	-0.39236301862844547	-0.36548682770691543	-0.3478438857223334	-0.33678195717059584	-0.3288333455970385	-0.2946737104648962	0.0056744243943386286	0.08059088172303418	0.15599381719652644	0.2222243767755125	0.5221397817157757	0.6866386245623548	0.7388119219464074	0.7598773130500811	0.8435989409625241	0.9052970529815885	1.7430043452146966	2.2838454699287922	
Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in "The Amazing Mr. Williams," a 1939 mystery/comedy that's quite good, although forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939.<br /><br />Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job, while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What happens in this film is no exception - he's called to a murder scene just as he's about to walk down the aisle yet again.<br /><br />Both stars were excellent at comedy, worked together well (and often), and help make this battle of the sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand for excellent support.<br /><br />As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas doesn't make much of a woman.<br /><br />Entertaining if a little on the long side.<br /><br />One of the comments here trashed Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man. He wasn't lazy, but rather, a very hard-working actor (who made it look easy) who had a Broadway career simultaneously with his film career. He just wasn't cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system. I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I Never Sang for my Father" and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk.	-2.5576404220482796	-2.308534175612649	-2.231896959471147	-1.3965363430194242	-1.270857653646762	-1.2514524623156937	-1.224760319977277	-0.4577721718166492	-0.39790540046343537	-0.36680109677314116	-0.22152499694587577	-0.1472313422633391	-0.0888311049008574	0.14581840734961588	0.502743231719177	0.5226972525068455	0.6052133020273422	0.7020341115985591	0.9912463107934324	1.13971105806085	1.2003589382340496	1.2744055682573292	1.9349168932753271	3.1101387911881737	4.863950622054687	
American-made final entry in the "Blood Island" series of Filipino horror films concerns Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), ruler of a fictional country. He dies of cancer, yet it's figured out how to bring him back: put his brain into a donor body. The mad doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) puts it in a highly unlikely body: the facially scarred giant manservant named Gor (John Bloom). A doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors' plans.<br /><br />Film-making partners Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) corral several actors they've worked with before, including Taylor, Adamsons' sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov, and Vicki Volante. They tried to go for the feel of the previous "Blood Island" entries but one can tell this was made stateside. While not necessarily a "good" film, it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole. A malevolent dwarf (Rossitto), gory operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job on Bloom, the political intrigue subplot, caverns full of cobwebs, etc. The narrative is actually pretty coherent, with plot twists thrown in here and there. I think it could have been trimmed a bit; some scenes drag. But it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect.<br /><br />For this kind of thing, the acting isn't too bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role. Volante is appealing enough, and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. In any event, it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing special, but as a trashy B "horror" (I use the word loosely, none of this is exactly scary) film, it certainly amuses.<br /><br />7/10	-3.591981445117524	-3.229472228037387	-2.654769148346596	-2.2493225528116856	-2.0280646841027665	-1.32469219918459	-1.1787709033553737	-0.9886699335152894	-0.9598377576205809	-0.505236566628181	-0.25061309219706984	-0.10524070744440134	-0.06958245553286785	0.10428656558437954	0.17625351569184725	0.35567258061113005	0.4952412990690237	0.7412183450281844	1.4164240727872635	1.688094149839229	2.525318739956436	2.58167810988336	2.632792619315047	3.9806656601509594	5.932512431555471	
Frankly I'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering. Have they all been written by his pals? The action clunks along, the music is irritating and over used, the script is simply dire and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) mediocre at best. I do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it's brilliant when it's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i.e. continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, it's his first film, low budget etc. - I get it, but it's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it's just not up to scratch.	-2.6596486517301408	-1.1982657418836622	-1.1817970986325117	-1.1532088029915182	-1.0839913281266829	-0.917818656810468	-0.9064084817014968	-0.2760179474570493	-0.1843882068150941	-0.06484992740355719	-0.04606218281811672	-0.042643992939610395	-0.02600177384312892	-0.025116869472014233	0.015439615925003397	0.04137942583625118	0.0672636115422649	0.17330067248893294	0.2226758669374509	0.2689347625484046	0.2797012658765185	0.5276218481516147	1.2709140895498616	1.4567043005717872	2.7043692762063127	
In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything "real" about this legend need to grow up. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. You guys seriously need to grow up.<br /><br />The fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from Tennessee believe it doesn't do it either. Go to college.

This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. And believe me, I have seen a lot of movies. The unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad "Alien lifeforms inhabit earth" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an Archchristian "Judgement day is at hand, seek Jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this. I didn't know what to do with myself when I watched the horrible acting that could have been performed by 7-year-olds. Simply disgusting. I am not a Christian nor very religious. But if I had been, I would no longer be afraid of Hell. Rich Christiano has shown be something much, much worse.	-4.854980582336072	-2.4090131429004904	-2.2228479682935447	-1.9934479920073267	-1.9533307795813784	-1.690107158343479	-1.6442076729353103	-0.26644947745805636	-0.21857993771409218	-0.11690885860296149	-0.07130055919921997	-0.03797163412342524	-0.016055259386632284	0.0842991551147992	0.19676109136642375	0.2669662258655034	0.38567691584520664	0.6376125594425671	0.668832689953734	0.6980837812879137	0.808613945699389	0.9553756466180674	2.185764620795701	2.7518433047802824	5.414794425908891	
Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12. We would like to see both- I can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it, it will not fit the same way on me. I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. Thank you.	-4.4186639542275925	-2.1965272958186857	-1.9313341182665205	-1.7098066768542537	-1.579947805434953	-0.9801856562160121	-0.6343981751622956	-0.5679745092038175	-0.5211681295398854	-0.4522032179516972	-0.38165369889876655	-0.3673759156283266	-0.1481931713910557	0.022115425343950102	0.12976705796883106	0.2626821927579145	0.28811949852812246	0.5505619096183717	0.6260891631083666	0.8845615865201184	0.8876747268812029	0.897615293894259	1.2638199092308158	2.440683032523945	4.639578995160983	
The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this film is "Graveyard of Horrors," but I think that must be an error. It should have been called "Graveyard of Horribles." Horrible acting, horrible editing, horrible story, and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard.<br /><br />Horrible.	-2.5533551521000915	-1.569441244104135	-1.4474145459411145	-1.418139710373957	-1.4099273931440124	-0.7641468012314573	-0.45366407249143903	-0.41053979292239073	-0.3493020374018512	-0.3279120465906337	-0.2573783919392693	-0.21909942717425895	-0.15921978917640853	-0.007129191204784391	0.04798410793591316	0.0842185659036832	0.17958309522878654	0.31908513968111085	0.44565138031376483	0.48572173755368675	0.5774628781682904	0.8176284441925462	1.011105076871028	1.5283989873219634	2.527642345690456	
Kirstie Alley, looking a bit slimmer, but only a bit, is in this mess along with a man who is a MacGuyver lookalike, bleached blond hair and all. The premise of the movie is about an older woman (50!!!) who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer. Not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting, inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for Kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who portrays Kirstie's brother is so wooden and miscast, it was torture to watch their scenes. What is there to say about this film. Avoid it.	-3.5547920147242147	-2.0014128412823666	-1.8399028376065165	-1.7402373725011278	-1.4785317299295841	-1.4010755534625687	-0.8204026957490204	-0.43713874669363123	-0.37420203550875536	-0.3201848939601386	-0.22917572396649713	-0.15492281165946964	-0.07490542639722214	-0.027276272826967637	0.16372809463372467	0.2653166652122271	0.331426012650415	0.36898664181156304	0.42242733143885597	0.4428816157594974	0.6157075017886333	0.8477160094385898	0.9338953763826039	1.9309017564668185	3.426098930498008

I have seen this film several times, and watched it today (on TCM) solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a much underrated actress and I have to admit I have had a crush on her since I first saw her (probably in "Wuthering Heights" 40 or more years ago). The real star in this movie, however, is Paul Lukas, and he deserved all the accolades he got. He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good. He gave his children a line about being bad, and that they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when conversing with adults, he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation. Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do.<br /><br />Some people think his victim was a Nazi, but I don't think so - I think he was only after the money. His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him.<br /><br />One interesting point in the film, and presumably also in the play, is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is a German. While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII, there was considerable anti-German sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry. It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time (maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the Nazi-Soviet pact!). After all, the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians. I think, however, that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later, after "Watch on the Rhine" was released.<br /><br />The title is something of a play on words, as the "watch" is looking west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song - used in WWII, but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well. But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own "Wach am Rhein".<br /><br />All the other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much there are children like him. I am surprised he did not give his father's secret away. In real life, he may very well have done so.	-5.036324470525915	-3.7885056180564876	-3.3214792385834704	-2.3480418647320316	-2.291230515245521	-1.4482930910917629	-1.1657068150763565	-0.8086441137522531	-0.6975383396404866	-0.40175527126821087	-0.3623400017282338	-0.29620456998060957	-0.20675316787110562	0.007604363418031668	0.2409605086465594	0.3467804617959979	0.4378330899253195	0.4481590067221628	1.4743710759919744	1.614525255480416	2.1506670886307293	2.1801450730464906	2.667055503419157	4.966346638449472	8.263467146305512	
I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few "throwaway" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.<br /><br />And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.<br /><br />To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. And, if you don't like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you.	-3.43911195727416	-2.889761136751753	-2.864370715239488	-2.4902525450021167	-1.231448696709165	-1.180928217551432	-1.1594678509888603	-0.8001899558632997	-0.38695913766939094	-0.3375022317287302	-0.21614304948970256	-0.012114740299392884	0.2151601005182177	0.4665916233252277	0.48404017373359126	0.5201830056004942	0.646574904667456	0.8398336923928637	0.8643003994703451	1.1440099286270486	1.160110000240259	1.8193256816282324	2.8326252337119042	3.8522502549632405	6.141202615510282	
This is an Oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one Arabian nights¨ plenty of incredible adventures, fantasy witchery and wizardly. The malignant vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt)with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad(attractive John Justin)who loses his throne, then he escapes thanks a little thief named Abu(sympathetic Sabu). They arrive Basora where Ahamad and the princess(gorgeous June Duprez) fall in love. But prince and thief are haunted by Jaffar , Ahamd is turned blind and Abu is become a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genie(overacting performed by Rex Ingram) who gives three wishes to Sabu , the magic eye, the figure of goddess Kali with several hands, among others.<br /><br />This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. Produced by London Fim's Alexander Korda and directed by the definitively credited Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson also dialogs writer and actor as Sultan fond to mechanic games. The WWII outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting, then the three Korda brothers and collaborators traveled USA continuing there the filming in especial on Grand Cannon Colorado.The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography , setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars : Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda ,Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn-out. Furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs	-2.535818668368885	-1.6417885344920047	-1.4079165506484739	-1.3313442226913268	-1.3116299345176212	-1.07743777537348	-0.930614813132173	-0.7162385425519633	-0.5819657777094356	-0.1572146904531197	0.23707130990818714	0.26144107571758807	0.27601072103352614	0.28750606136541995	0.39107949115965857	0.48246000337992323	0.7604127291515429	0.849477685873828	0.9328769540463955	1.404041941421724	1.7860538221160513	1.9416697241942364	2.1926235154814	3.365712114807234	4.73158982076162	
the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater. i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004, and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival. it was an interesting premise, and seemed like it could go somewhere, but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything. first of all, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they weren't obvious rhymes, they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical, right? not in this case. luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they did sing it made me cringe. especially when they attempted to sing in harmony. and that just addresses the music. some of the acting was pretty good, but a lot of the dialog was terrible, as well as most of the scenes. they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad editor, because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical. i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.	-5.921330254971	-2.695168996309256	-2.55848067763824	-2.3721556980124907	-2.2302465985603743	-2.197688354599647	-2.063954017498913	-1.2152367983902777	-0.8769977126679596	-0.6848681543656542	-0.5554059280792402	-0.18016785352702896	-0.0785971465884963	-0.03276483308798593	0.22539888380354242	0.2534469907476397	0.3027060142272832	0.9332211641882283	0.9658712042378576	0.9736100493475598	1.0638530668501986	2.0706441040621715	2.713093189826328	3.13681032458518	7.011117441918918	
OK, I am not Japanese. I do know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Other than that, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor.<br /><br />Good, with that point set, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and I am surprised he came up with this. It may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases, I am afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked- I mean, give the audience a break, and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd action.<br /><br />However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures. It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene.<br /><br />I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke.<br /><br />Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European. Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people, maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation. Maybe.	-4.833463345326407	-3.4901789916506574	-2.9210695479954714	-2.40656053811626	-2.2182361820224057	-1.6787508626417267	-0.8678473140322761	-0.7261218770525081	-0.6347100817057135	-0.07187882537425942	-0.06407718538592203	-0.02669234662675058	-0.005784182558225159	0.049214093032812586	0.05458748912542116	0.08470485189625412	0.27289964940065264	0.5074438071586261	0.8496907949239335	1.0861668111719969	1.9216241399243286	2.241902019653148	2.5761456921010852	4.238297132825725	7.346763360085442	
I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me. But when I saw the actual film, I was disappointed. The acting is stilted, and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit about it. A lot of facts in the movie are right on target, but this film should have been much better. The entire birthday party scene, for example, lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or the story, and should have been left on the cutting room floor. A more heavy-handed editor might have been able to get a decent film out of this mess.<br /><br />Please understand, I'm not in any way, shape or form involved with the other Bell Witch movie, and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb listing.

The Man Who Knew Too Much{1956}is a remake of a film that Alfred Hitchcock made in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, his later effort is far superior. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn't have the spine tingling suspense of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films the plot is essentially the same, except the original is set in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech . It tells the story of a married couple {James Stewart and Doris Day}vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man, that is very curious about their past. It just so happens, he's an agent that's looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader.Then he gets stabbed in a Marrakeck market because of it being found out that he's a spy,and proceeds to fall into Stewart's arms.Dying,he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot.Stewart and Day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son.The film contains excellent performances by Stewart and Day,in a straight dramatic role,as worried and frightened parents.This film proved that Doris Day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals.The direction by Alfred Hitchcock is top-notch.The film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute.The scene in Albert Hall is a classic.The original is so slow-paced and drab.I don't know how people can compare the two.Just watch the remake and you'll enjoy it.I give the movie a 9 out of 10.	-2.1981377475448385	-1.2400337749081936	-1.2317680141848686	-0.9820197518189091	-0.8054892140723102	-0.5771498406203378	-0.5110917481326875	-0.25671587962325265	-0.16847558849224367	-0.1506716262869073	-0.09076216324117158	0.05556978993425493	0.07221659257666133	0.23442657679022008	0.2747962046786642	0.27525508531735454	0.32591598153427737	0.33594985668326394	0.4625517500768094	0.5117180392811002	0.8415420024129442	1.088580485395803	1.7767361268097446	2.007271618041355	3.2217138887230243	
Flipping through the channels I was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie. I must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately. I love older films and this is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!	-1.5341555552475952	-1.3902601997853268	-0.8229731549546201	-0.694965046295294	-0.5933000803640051	-0.21694428980475275	-0.1782817730888578	-0.1446358146316662	-0.08870123548945633	0.13364922292991807	0.14601678602045381	0.15177758596544766	0.21116476845664428	0.26780084887343386	0.4149791136052631	0.4772022571563865	0.495800312290031	0.5523204448458989	0.6307406080976827	0.6478213828288445	0.6762568363186832	0.6942789332885111	1.478414538911149	1.7095311040527998	1.7184762615812614	
Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And were is all the blood and gore that was in "Demons" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My Brother said that this movie was bad but I had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. When the movie was over I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music by "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. And I saw that it has been released four sequels after this film, I haven't seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one, I have no plans to see them but maybe I will see them some time.	-2.7774018499786814	-1.9056875997944993	-1.6596505991494785	-1.544537899452265	-1.183614886548186	-1.057712884496848	-0.9414480765373443	-0.4446906608920304	-0.3783177278395072	-0.22216379477882617	-0.13847866087108618	-0.04525779355652522	-0.039174488021319454	0.021669457127548013	0.03926509644812118	0.0788298644846486	0.5426844034385443	0.5530093665973266	0.6846912156367877	0.793224455822332	0.9167280567914131	1.0179641471785128	1.2532790910301979	2.466323081581498	3.742751846888854	
Well, I'll begin with this: I love horror-movies, not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. Second; this is the worst movie of all times. It even beats Mean Guns, and the attack of the killer tomatoes. And for that I pay it homage.<br /><br />However, the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed, after which point everything was so so sad. To my great surprise, the reviews where somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from 7 and up; I KNOW YOU'RE JOKING! GOOD ONE!! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world, and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is; you can't be for real.<br /><br />Everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up, so I'll leave it. <br /><br />MINOR SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />But the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog-kennel for ten minutes, with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two, really does it for me.	-4.2586869937332645	-2.422668440730342	-2.3649983379720605	-2.3445067683285767	-1.880764596175625	-0.9825610170357513	-0.8521901093100399	-0.5597428324410555	-0.46127209432206484	-0.38121416659682583	-0.34126945006874043	-0.029414219596987007	-0.01594036646280901	0.04029770431905588	0.11304933019635811	0.11356896697358153	0.29348910465450007	0.46221997562279954	0.5940203515372029	0.6151748428509526	0.8859184064177927	0.9819554094916807	1.3166991989383359	2.7006664176995763	4.776467269851507	
This short is one of the best of all time and is proof (just like most of Charlie Chaplin's work) that sound and color are not requirements for quality work. In fact, this cartoon uses (and may have started) some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years, like caricatures of celebrities (including the afore-mentioned Chaplin. While the characters are silent, they do "speak", by use of word balloons, just like in the comics. Given that Felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip, this device is a natural. The atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension (literally and figuratively) and makes this short a delight to watch. Well worth taking the time and effort to get. Most highly recommended.	-1.745832105905643	-1.1937562043966854	-0.7703303701278317	-0.5348583279920838	-0.31719507455888796	-0.06704006398244211	0.0021658792462253065	0.08407585483662963	0.1441247315064041	0.15437462942658967	0.1637294589846132	0.17371449105324552	0.18184106521009005	0.21660813760070324	0.22085527148608414	0.23968127290284522	0.26550878135573874	0.31870333883292445	0.412936797506232	0.4285678387270303	0.5393562435545893	0.7840901540002498	1.0749801675937625	1.745649455856032	2.100491068402415	
Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with "The Mortal Storm" or "Casablanca". Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of "The Mortal Storm" and "Watch On The Rhine" are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with "Casablanca" is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar. It does not strike me as totally wrong. Lukas had a good career in film (both here and in England - he is the villain in "The Lady Vanishes"), and this performance was his best one. Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine (for instance, he was ignored for Sam Spade in "The Maltese Falcon" and Roy Earle in "High Sierra" two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C. Dobbs in "The Treasure Of Sierra Madres", the writer/murder suspect in "In A Lonely Place", and Captain Philip Francis Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny" afterward - he got it for Charley in "The African Queen"). I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs, but it did not happen. But Lukas was lucky - he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career. Few can claim that.<br /><br />To me the film to look at with "Watch On The Rhine" is based on another play/script by Hellman, "The Searching Wind". They both look at America's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s. "The Searching Wind" is really looking at the whole inter-war period, while "Watch On The Rhine", set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II, deals with a few weeks of time. Therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it's impact. <br /><br />The film has many good performances, led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined anti-Nazi fighter/courier, Davis as his loyal wife (wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the play's activities), Coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck, Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald (as Coulouris' wiser and sadder and fed up wife), and Kurt Katch, who delivers a devastating critique (as the local embassy's Gestapo chief) about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis. It has dialog with bite in it. And what it says is quite true. It also has moments of near poetry. Witness the scene, towards the end, when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis, and says, "The New World has left the scene to the Old World". Hellman could write very well at times.<br /><br />Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films.	-3.4317985799669004	-2.880521182216397	-2.7837224066498685	-2.426772462334146	-1.3217166703907524	-1.2558513317862743	-0.8373611946276772	-0.5920418899930536	-0.4938305256012914	-0.3845324597925637	-0.20786126078165726	-0.1415115187322977	-0.02761119509741374	0.20267442822288717	0.23428825645754792	0.30240599292695014	0.5250523722584033	0.6221562439836267	1.1809630987588489	1.5228994963986795	1.8521282198457445	2.2123767306898525	3.0662979570779245	3.4790921296317054	4.7056354623747545	
I was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. And talk about hype, I even heard an interview with the show's creator on the BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. All of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. All of the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - well - mediocre (I'm being nice). It's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails.<br /><br />If you're Muslim I think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. Not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. It's only a problem when it isn't funny - as in this show.<br /><br />Canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis. So how come the producers of this show couldn't find any?	-5.293527553762027	-2.713205846046676	-2.661199098171341	-2.387375373878346	-2.1382518092165146	-1.7580524578379377	-1.6575425094494558	-0.4733338269831842	-0.4018035160013112	-0.3590375033438638	-0.32234443898011866	-0.24854245629841626	0.24984253291082809	0.343308228499521	0.4601853778154376	0.5247207665965378	0.687377538917994	0.7345521779937598	0.8655644742277243	0.9363346316045529	0.9791384254165904	1.1909108536096102	1.5579760503078113	3.374499984624669	6.657933901901814	
Wow, was this version of THE RACKETEER tough to watch! While none of the other reviews have mentioned this, the public domain version I watched was seriously flawed. The sound track was off by about 10 seconds--meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching. So, you'd hear something occur well before you saw it--a very confusing proposition! The worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi.<br /><br />While this seriously marred the film, it also made concentrating on the dialog easier--and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well. The dialog was simply awful--often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. As one review said, it was like watching a high school play. Part of this is understandable, as sound was a new medium, but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films--really bad. And, like many of these early sound films, the film was just too talky--with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. And you'd THINK with a title like "The Racketeer" that there would be some action!! However, it's really a sappy romance--with very little action.<br /><br />The film finds Carol Lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician. She herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him--and the crook, Robert Armstrong, comes to her assistance. When Armstrong catches her cheating at cards, he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet--and naturally he falls for her in the process. The problem is that once the drunk sobers up, he, too, wants Lombard and she needs to choose between them. Wow...a recovering drunk or a mobster...talk about a couple great prospects! Overall, it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print I saw. However, even if you ignore this, the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature. And...it was sappy too boot.	-9.888673147130838	-4.320903505372584	-4.054548282239149	-3.890439207363683	-3.8557187330913636	-3.3833030521531238	-3.3660288279025194	-1.029447282921026	-0.7389573393162445	-0.6616436159311185	-0.48497157866223384	-0.35306764661101486	-0.34210088928965654	-0.21065877958925316	0.3876139379538778	0.5442085062625753	0.8634647541874433	0.9170341065825243	1.077237488859924	1.1261134242134108	1.5576475268038763	2.4164639222834317	4.074108965932572	5.165948240674651	11.157924645812951	
Get ready for it: This is one of my favourite films of all time. I am relatively unaware of David Mamet's (writer and director) other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times(it's always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is extremely well written, and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit, con-artistry and back room hustles. The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and it also pays homage to film noir.<br /><br />It's quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters. It is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch.<br /><br />Generally, the acting is superb- especially Joe Mantegna- but someone who I watched the film with remarked to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not only a gambler, a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80's hairdo. I agree, but I think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role.<br /><br />The less you know about the plot of this film, the better, just like Mamet's most recent film, The Spanish Prisoner, because the ending will be even more impressive. Just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.	-2.6273900186450025	-1.7611188732407337	-1.3597560873853674	-0.6248333979427122	-0.6059045496798714	-0.5397823933386593	-0.2644192344873517	-0.20550252313510164	-0.11320922804276054	-0.05234754470241573	-0.030419317378949318	0.020019720801601748	0.06078630966896684	0.14257956314805942	0.1482427748293605	0.31778164819914884	0.39329565084063084	0.583932735299733	0.7656196027908279	1.0580763520446177	1.9121617614969146	1.995637508124525	2.275859290842031	2.6707329559133273	3.0526702613327403	
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it. So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) to stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he's learned over the years.<br /><br />I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what I thought. But I decided to give FOF a go because Shadow Man (by the same director) wasn't bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe, just maybe, he could make a great film again. Oh what a fool I was.<br /><br />Dubbing, horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and a boring, sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />Thankfully his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'll be skipping), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, meaning no more of these awful European lensed action films and his next film Prince of Pistols might mark a return to theatres. Hell, he's done it before and Stallone will have managed to do it before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /><br />This isn't a Flight of Fury. It isn't even a flight of fun. It's a flight that fails to even take off the ground. *	-7.672375409025214	-3.7042351086802356	-3.576862673700989	-3.4013437492201777	-3.281592853993333	-2.174337556847279	-1.1007063894199276	-1.0680523358638985	-0.9371759796508111	-0.6422569625682092	-0.6212710323604586	-0.38901120535765377	-0.36608547395327856	0.2841534358416158	0.2952635764839184	0.3294911417531128	0.7115974907668936	0.8198205426821206	1.0194799112431214	1.203890283173593	1.3388379923135214	1.5503354753632834	2.2880461853624174	3.9760412054334497	7.5477001794424385	
LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected! He did a fabulous job acting as a "renegade" cop within a "renegade" department. From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in. He acts as a sort of "gentle giant" -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job. He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.<br /><br />This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards. After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. That he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down. I was hoping to see more from him in this film.<br /><br />Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. This movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot-out.<br /><br />What irked me most was the way Timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes. He starts out having guns and not using them. Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life. Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo?! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you'll probably love this movie. Personally, it doesn't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic. Make me believe that the story is true. This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied.	-7.538733666914706	-4.908824651734507	-4.782609593589836	-4.326664606483892	-2.955047882878601	-2.616652284365539	-1.9465291999922558	-0.7513109308639314	-0.5564638732652264	-0.3712990927145542	-0.15583512825363305	-0.07390145574932772	0.26214366151147506	0.6766932193433134	0.7487415952892782	0.8477049969984742	0.9827141102361032	0.9958820378536241	1.039833695396926	1.2214121801906066	2.7148259678609636	3.07428404870974	3.791341999128795	5.679225475651962	10.72392903790956	
I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).<br /><br />It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times. Overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,...but that's really about all.	-6.377055252118836	-3.911026185272915	-3.273619336363237	-2.6031935721458	-2.5559203775705255	-2.3857167771751535	-2.3505628031111616	-0.6205877522672094	-0.44938529506059754	-0.3766404998695517	-0.36548103732056014	-0.11664508710817371	-0.040983959973727946	0.2078109629285657	0.46575652994893685	0.5113494089812425	0.5809312943801985	0.6706376311661331	1.0867786905702963	1.173067728515449	1.6207062662253244	1.6348061720714504	2.5207074304556203	4.1207554252745195	8.444714492502884	
Less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH should not be really be compared with such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, or PSYCHO; it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Shot largely on location in Morocco and London, the film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot--and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence.<br /><br />James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in their roles of the All-American couple, and the characters are given an unusual twist: Stewart, a midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touch of "the ugly American abroad" about his personality; Day, who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage, has a suspicious nature. These qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story.<br /><br />THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene in which Stewart drugs Day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall sequence, involving what seems hundreds of cuts, are very powerful. Less often noticed, although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory, are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor, as when Stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and Day belts out "Que Sera, Sera" (written for this film) in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party.<br /><br />Although THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's greater work, it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole. It's Hitchcock-light, but recommended.<br /><br />Gary F.

Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse.<br /><br />This one starts with Seagal getting picked up by the FBI because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the cliché 'evil English villain' that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days.<br /><br />Suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent. The story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story, characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to.<br /><br />In short a terrible script with bad dialog, delivered by sub-par actors, boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes, and non-relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near-impossible and make the movie even worse.<br /><br />Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss, even if you are Seagal's most ardent fan.	-4.574951576446382	-3.1494248371304003	-2.8737548598577165	-2.802808780812232	-2.2367904073572773	-0.9914958053755024	-0.9629661248995733	-0.7965271007665866	-0.6403871879699324	-0.4048442640611999	-0.3664114100269498	-0.3358403692048474	-0.02361451206917073	0.039141227068513126	0.08334861468645165	0.13143246472340073	0.1472101453060438	0.4103818513689196	0.43482216297669635	0.48861910611621967	0.9270500773490076	1.1262091066511537	1.5457181293110267	2.63814580805787	4.396766789712276	
After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love. The primary reason to see "Before Sunrise," is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As "Celine," this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. <br /><br />If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as "Jessie" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. <br /><br />After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. <br /><br />Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason, she probably won't show, while Jesse, who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to Vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.<br /><br />Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, "Before Sunrise" is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel, "Before Sunset."	-4.10029164993301	-4.0770074281258495	-3.3674448250744073	-2.6378000721186283	-2.3896978219114087	-2.055954098075256	-1.956201712771206	-1.0085293338325754	-0.9515513338831367	-0.6039697353969136	-0.6026524768639094	-0.41156867779192674	-0.14294198565253902	0.1849968650750825	0.7752541307186805	0.8627189150624655	1.0865063628644724	1.3461885614473037	1.5075770497368117	1.6523471000184013	1.728167481854327	1.98588571752328	3.859864423206814	4.757474766831738	7.992601164281197	
Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film, and be forced to play a part-Mexican or he would have been suspended. Believe me , he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after the success of "Dodge City", Warners tried a follow-up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of buddies, like Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and the ever-present John Litel, but they made the huge mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really make things bad, because she proved one thing, and that is she cannot sing. The story was not too bad, but with Bogie clearly miscast also, it turned out to be a poor Western that was overlong, and on a low budget, but in fairness, color would not have helped.	-2.5823582304080634	-1.4664640984453234	-1.2036488520589046	-1.1195846939290675	-1.1025600003425868	-0.6546178314814572	-0.4796929357034831	-0.3191469067259828	-0.3056807036208857	-0.2445574948106797	-0.22427788969107448	-0.1953725061880078	-0.17632835145109207	-0.15219735201354762	-0.11258094561110646	0.05835727076346933	0.16918831353386915	0.18478762390008058	0.18703320640858878	0.35393181932526174	0.3872194864018116	0.47415604035980924	1.0082426604736368	1.2261041459370086	2.600641224923422	
...Or better yet, watch Fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars which usually means it's fairly watchable) but I pretty much fast-forwarded through it. Usually road trip movies have great music, but I can't even recall whether there was music. The only high point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker/guru. Otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way. The four main characters are unknown actors and I don't remember seeing any of them in another movie. (Oh, yeah, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was in it, but he's in everything, good, bad or indifferent). This movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you're not.	-2.5455808996094365	-1.7565870436079059	-1.2172625922345162	-1.0748423996974021	-0.8681504661496678	-0.7198050078573336	-0.6902104627066225	-0.5288973600004309	-0.2589161103948592	-0.19637849690941372	-0.14429681608901027	-0.1434605479083062	-0.03722987983344908	0.13656828642525012	0.16591582717318804	0.17901463920643138	0.23613029278355005	0.5002866773524183	0.6529269041683188	0.7235984481578418	0.8668195990087609	0.8729582771954287	1.1622109244043228	1.9047448286220656	3.4802884003577823	
Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced, economical and very entertaining. I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life. This is one of Warner's few hard-edged melodramas that simply doesn't work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations. Sol Polito's camera work is strong. Somehow, this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (in a year that gave us "M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").	-2.4225235487854317	-2.3210870518088993	-2.2748672558049456	-1.7264355417344988	-1.39612431563153	-0.9791267995771202	-0.8535947543043862	-0.8185228760177763	-0.3420390524217554	-0.15335540599164726	-0.11003503876650539	-0.0808904062676844	0.02484744073809529	0.05169138531666577	0.11663488806663765	0.14298925974015125	0.36536364126467047	0.3889237550434091	0.45416595296536694	0.9716514623273992	1.1113327237421489	1.7595292844822108	1.8799493015834565	2.8028730957216674	4.533999969825258	
I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned. From the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein. Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.<br /><br />It's bleak, depressing and hopeless. While I don't mind a less than cheery ending, I'm really very tired of the "humans suck" cliché that's central to every movie. I know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how's 'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil! Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired. This way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive. It's silly, not thoughtful, and boring.	-5.557318580676661	-2.8590737063115146	-2.553285649527919	-2.404631842408825	-2.093628478486802	-2.0885403677040157	-1.7409572763512566	-0.6886838998995524	-0.6353935629835462	-0.20462859453383506	-0.1750538135812275	-0.1020614842442722	0.0025430918935926902	0.04139961325356006	0.06548815596188012	0.14025835543557627	0.22223885596869095	0.42500718905062806	0.4391533647562308	0.48453079730257576	0.8563410306318258	0.9784515505394819	2.111591187954295	2.9811196144726297	5.84188585571336	
Lynne Ramsey makes arresting images, and Samantha Morton can summon feeling with a gesture. So what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered, pretentious lark. <br /><br />Ramsey can't bring Callar to life. Her attempts are too arty and oblique. Repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if Morton's obliterated gaze alone could supply character. We are in a blank Warholian hell of self-indulgence: for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor, you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist. But how will it do so if she rarely speaks? Without the novel's interior monologue, the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody. Small wonder Ramsey has Morton undress often.<br /><br />That said, the first ten minutes were so impressively acted, shot and edited that my hopes were soaring. Give the film that much: it knows how to make promises, if not how to keep any.	-3.153745890362615	-1.8099917504476752	-1.4679639838888032	-1.0875586421648304	-0.9925869816134103	-0.7946421644681815	-0.6975060978035543	-0.6911839413176821	-0.17312253617679252	-0.07178764320394569	0.020705881879939353	0.02757329464076682	0.06055071112576649	0.22009093826650178	0.2704017210971807	0.4187093349237651	0.4263790457221408	0.4999761896342761	0.541089595651526	0.7627140806526257	0.95922303142312	1.0673164489195812	1.3363745569210785	1.7340051829287204	3.739019842895729	
Irrespective of the accuracy of facts, Bandit Queen is a true story, its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994. This movie is violent, powerful and thought provoking.The protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood, whose adversity brought out the best(or worst) out of her. Keeping the subjectivity aside, there is no doubt that Phoolan's character from a young girl of 8, who is married off by her father to clear a debt(pun intended), to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste, has evolved into a champion in her own right. Her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre.<br /><br />I can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen needs to be 'studied' in the Indian context, and not just checked out in stereotypes. I may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the Indian audience, its a shame that the movie had a delayed, overtly censored release in India.<br /><br />Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in India, being a woman and that too a lower caste, her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life, which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess. She responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be. Call it divine justice or judiciary failure, had she killed a single person she would have been hanged, she killed 24 and got revered, respected and glorified.<br /><br />P.S # Whoever found her character "psychotic", needs to be sodomized at 8, gangraped by 10 men at a go and paraded naked. Then they should be asked- How normal do they feel?	-4.4233588854969526	-2.7780023044413067	-2.4296444053662776	-2.4162981733108264	-2.3152733034045574	-1.0340643751157046	-0.6723728117942103	-0.42696053787933974	-0.19652030476164056	-0.14813864630742235	-0.11013903166229279	0.018181924575356917	0.2564195406672885	0.26789755759071066	0.2784961883649646	0.33470039190434786	0.5313031158737964	0.6172079629874601	0.6287874517217112	0.8259232285027831	0.884004442025945	1.100021864969513	1.1337310289248903	3.052708512234801	6.068628690304982	
Olivia D'Abo in a wet T-shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it. Other than that, this Canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of hillbillies is not worth anybody's time. The writing is bad, the acting is poor and the direction is sub-standard.	-2.0553100287255495	-1.1998286481906129	-1.1046090102306505	-0.94151644049018	-0.8821929688886707	-0.45791396586784316	-0.3569468783298342	-0.3394231543477625	-0.32913453723507635	-0.3187387225598375	-0.29631555606189025	-0.12442806469159223	-0.06890905809915213	-0.04855523866668693	0.06070601884598417	0.16358685708474924	0.3336355163757237	0.3566368847376845	0.3740858615142861	0.43038557752989115	0.4589855581297019	0.46006445532650786	0.8357128264051028	1.097309677516499	2.028286239837595	
OK, it was a "risky" move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose.Well, I was wrong. This is, next to "Bloodsurf", the worst "horrormovie" I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad. That is why I give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie..... Do not rent or buy it. Stay away from it and hope that this horrible, horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a "cult classic". It most definitely do not deserve any recognition.	-3.2452080806979358	-2.1076433946699766	-2.062446326094377	-1.9367773201708487	-1.4743882751833832	-1.4636484563484875	-1.321077728741854	-0.7484656745061853	-0.48165018584627056	-0.42393624911711436	-0.1894324265566713	-0.12250033394030194	-0.08383745106320975	-0.050279531327288664	0.014339481710479607	0.2597989449457293	0.35921426917926935	0.4184548865095014	0.4695791475190514	0.9097145460724528	1.021422207648462	1.0988346291739244	1.1445558908169138	2.5951804955566575	4.729002772804618
